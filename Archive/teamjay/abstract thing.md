(We are in charge of the abstract/overall goals, right?) 

# Goals

Publishable results that tell a story.  (That's pretty generic, but yeah).  

More specifically, we want to scrape transcripts of certain shows from the internet and analyze sentiment to predict/model (? word choice) certain features.  

IE relationships between characters, target audience, shifts in language over the progression of the show, change in writers, etc.  

# Metrics

(Hopefully by speaker?)

* Vocabulary size and richness.  (Depth and breadth of vocabulary)
* Word length.

- Word frequency.  

* Profanity frequency.  
* Sentiment analysis.
* Syntax.

There were a few more... 

# Plan

Data scraping of two shows will be handled by two teams.  One team per show.  

​	Hopefully after some analysis is done, we work on gathering more data from other shows to broaden the analysis.  

Shows = Spongebob and Seinfeld (yes?).  

After data is collected and cleaned, and in a useable format, teams will reassemble based on analytical goals.  

​	Those being things like modeling relationships between characters, picking up on humor, etc.
