# Abstract
We clean and analyze online transcripts of several popular American sitcoms (Family Guy, South Park, Seinfeld, ) and present our findings.
Our groups look to gain some insight onto the development of humor from more to less mature sitcoms as one of the primary goals in this project.
We also look to compare the complexity of vocabulary between the shows.
The desired outcome of this project is a text generator which will be able to create new content based on the styles of these individual shows.

# Timeline

This project has two main parts. 

## Part one

Two groups will scrape transcripts from two shows from the internet, clean the data, and make sure the data are in a useable format.  

## Part two 

Once part one is completed, two groups (not necessarily the same members as previous two groups) will analyze the scraped data for sentiment and vocabulary complexity shifts.  Other focuses may arise as the project continues, but for now, those are the main goals.  

After analysis is completed, we hope to write a publication-quality article about our findings.

# Steps to completing the project

1. Pick a standard format in which to store script data.
2. Write a program that goes to a web page and stores the script data in that standard format.
3. Look at the results of converting the data into that format.
4. Clean the data where necessary.
5. Write functions that take measurements/count specific phenomena in the data.
6. Produce data visualizations/report stats.
7. Perform an analysis on the numbers.
8. Write an article explaining analysis/summarizing the results.

# Conclusion

We hope to learn something about the target audiences for each show based on the transcripts of those shows based on the vocabulary used and general tone of dialogue.
