## <a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract
We will clean and analyze online transcripts of several popular American sitcoms (Family Guy, South Park, Seinfeld, Spongebob) and present our findings.
Our groups are looking to gain some insight onto the development of humor from more to less mature sitcoms as one of the primary goals in this project.
We also look to compare the complexity of vocabulary between the shows.
The desired outcome of this project is a text generator which will be able to create new content based on the styles of these individual shows.

We hope to learn something about the target audiences for each show based on the transcripts of those shows based on the vocabulary used and general tone of dialogue.
