"george"," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
              is coming in?"
"jerry"," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
"george","  So, ya know, what, what happened?"
"jerry"," Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
"george"," So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
              you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
"jerry"," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
              called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
              maybe we'll get together. "
"george"," No...no...no, I hate to tell you this you're not gonna 
              see this woman."
"jerry","  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
"george"," You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
              a B-plan of contingency!"
"jerry"," Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
"george","  Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
              she has to  come 
              to New York on business..."

              about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get 
              my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
"george","  Right, 
              I knew I felt something...! "
"george"," What?!"
"jerry"," Laura."

               Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
              you just see if it's dried?"
"jerry"," No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
              it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
"george","  Any questions?"
"jerry"," How could she not tell me where she was staying? "
"kramer"," Why even give her an option?"
"george"," Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
              a ticket."
"jerry"," Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
              bathroom."
"george"," Yeah, I wish."
"jerry"," Let me just wipe the sink."
"kramer"," ...How's the real estate-business?"
"jerry"," Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's 
              thinking?"
"george"," 'Cause it's all in the greeting. "
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"george"," Ya know a hug definitely good."
"jerry"," Hug is definitely good."
"george"," That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
"jerry"," Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
              eyes?"

"jerry"," So uh, what do ya think?"
"elaine"," Oh, lovely..."
"elaine"," Yeah, you met her when we were going out."
"elaine"," Right! In fact... No, never mind..."

"elaine"," Why does he do that?"
"jerry"," So c'mon, do we have a deal?"
"elaine"," It is not necessary."

"jerry"," Imagine, spelling ""Mom"" with two O's..."

"elaine"," No. A general guy."

"elaine"," And... he's *hilarious*."
"jerry"," ...Yes."
"elaine","  OK, so, now, is there anything"
"elaine"," You oughtta least take a look at it."
"elaine"," Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have"

"kramer","  Jerry,

"elaine"," So what did he say?"

"kramer"," Yeah! "
"jerry"," If only the coin hadn't hit the table."
"elaine"," My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel."
"george"," Hi, Carol."
"jerry"," It's wonderful. "
"george"," Nice meeting you. [shakes Carol's hand; they sit down"
"jerry"," How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh,"
"george"," You would think that, but either you're born with a sense 
              of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go 
              from the red sun of Krypton all"
"jerry"," Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected 
              by the yellow sun of Earth?"
"elaine"," I dropped a grape."
"george"," Pardon?"
"elaine"," Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic

"jerry"," You better find that grape before it mutates into another 
              life form.  There was once a mutant grape that terrorized

"george"," I'll have the tuna."
"jerry"," You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont."
"jerry"," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"

"jerry","  George, what's going on?!"
"kramer"," You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. 
              And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
"jerry"," Okay."
"kramer","  Hey, where.. where are you going? You

"jerry","  So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine

"kramer","  Oh. Oh, Marlene."
"jerry"," I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized."
"kramer"," Yeah, no kidding."

"jerry"," Right. For reducing the pond scum?"
"jerry","  These peas are bursting with country-fresh

              swell up, and I can't dance."
"jerry"," No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in 
              Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.."

              and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that."
"george"," They always make me take stock of my life and how I've 
              pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting 
              it."

"jerry"," I don't know. That's like 
              asking ""Where's Waldo?"""
"jerry"," Oh, he's having a heart 
              attack."
"george"," Radiating waves of pain.."
"jerry"," I know what this is. You 
              saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.  I 
              saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure"
"george"," Manhattan Memorial, less 
              of a line."
"jerry"," I'll call an ambulance. 
              "
"george","  
              What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it 
              Lupis?!"
"elaine","  
              Whose tonsils grow back? "
"jerry"," Yeah, if you've been exposed 
              to gamma rays."
"elaine","  Oh, I'm sorry. 
               I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.

"george"," Well, what should I do, 
              Kramer?"
"jerry"," Well, for one think, don't 
              listen to him."
"kramer"," No, no, he's out. He 
              got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame 
              him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel."

              there is no justice."
"jerry"," She's the performance artist, right?"
"jerry"," C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something."
"elaine"," Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, 
              intelligent woman."
"george"," What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent 
              women?"
"jerry"," Thin ice, George. Thin ice.."
"george"," She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront 
              in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances""."
"jerry"," Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?"
"george"," And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never 
              even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. 
              Nothing. Like I"
"jerry"," What ever happened with the shirt?"
"elaine"," anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying 
              no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval."
"george"," Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower."
"jerry"," Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for 
              me."
"elaine","  I do have one teeny little problem, though."
"george"," Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing."
"elaine"," She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr 
              with a twist of Lyme disease."
"elaine"," I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in."
"george","  Never said goodbye. Goodbye!"
"jerry"," Explain to me how this baby shower thing works."
"jerry"," When is this suppose to be?"
"george"," Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that 
              woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive 
              myself until I do."
"jerry"," And if you do?"
"kramer"," What are you doing this for? Look at you.."
"jerry","  Leave me alone."
"kramer"," Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable 
              companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for 
              years."
"jerry"," Well, they might hook us up again."
"kramer"," Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're 
              saying?!"
"jerry"," It's against the law."
"kramer","  Look, will you at least let me 
              bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. 
              He escaped the Gulag. He's"

              the Russian guy? The Russian"
"jerry"," What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the 
              drinks now?"

"elaine"," The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't 
              do this now!"
"kramer"," Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys."

"george","  You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, 
              kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?"

              want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What 
              do you say? What do you"

              story to tell"
"george"," Yeah, well, he probably bought it."
"jerry"," So what happened with Tatiana?"
"george"," Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom.

              for the conditioner to work."
"jerry"," I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab."
"elaine","  Yes, a guy."
"jerry"," Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."

"elaine"," Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
"george"," I didn't know he'd get fired."
"jerry","  
              He'll probably kill his family over this."
"elaine"," Was it my fault?"
"elaine"," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
"elaine"," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
"kramer"," Take me where? Where?"
"george"," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't

        got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing 
        suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear

        floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that

"kramer"," That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie

"jerry"," Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld. "
"george"," It's George."
"jerry"," Come on up .  ...What's he doing here 
              now?"
"kramer"," Let me have her number."
"jerry"," Sheriff?........What's with the hat?"
"george"," Aahh..No..No.."
"jerry"," What's up?"

"jerry"," Does she know?"
"george"," Because I promised her."

"jerry"," She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence"

"george"," Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all"
"jerry"," Did you bump into anybody you knew?"
"george"," Ok, thanks."
"jerry"," What do you need a job, you got Audrey."
"george"," You won't think I'm a bad person?"
"jerry"," Too late for that."
"george"," Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a 
        little"
"jerry"," A little."
"george"," Why don't you just commit yourself already?"
"kramer"," Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm 
        going"
"kramer"," What? What?"
"elaine"," How could you say something like that?!"
"kramer"," Well, I was just trying to help out."
"elaine"," Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin. 
      "
"george"," They way he just says stuff."
"george"," Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?"
"george"," Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating 
        class"
"george"," If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will 
        tell you"
"elaine"," You encouraged her to get one."
"george"," I didn't encourage. No encourage."
"elaine"," I think it's a mistake."
"george"," Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one."
"george"," Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but..."
"jerry"," Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have 
        ever"
"elaine"," How do you even know the jacket is there?"
"elaine"," It looks good."
"jerry"," I'm Nelson!"
"kramer"," My contention?"
"elaine"," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
"kramer"," You don't say?"
"elaine"," I found it!"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about."
"george"," Why did France give that to us anyway?"
"jerry"," It was a gift."
"george"," Really? They work here in the office?"
"jerry"," Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything. 
            "
"george"," ""Off the wagon""?"
"jerry"," I think it's off the wagon."
"elaine"," *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! "
"elaine"," I though I'd never find it."
"george"," Well today's your lucky day."
"elaine"," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. 
              Dick, this is Jerry and this is George."
"jerry"," ""The guy?"""
"george"," I like Mike Lubika."
"george"," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay."
"jerry"," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold 
              it."
"jerry"," Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking."
"elaine"," Hey what's that?"
"george"," It's an early Christmas present."
"kramer"," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. 
              Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose 
              as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, 
              why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n..."
"jerry"," I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people 
              happy."
"kramer"," What's that red dot on your sweater?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it."
"jerry"," Ahem. Say that again?"
"elaine"," You're still here. You're a dynamo."
"george"," I can't believe I get paid for this."
"george"," Why is that?"
"jerry"," It's a woman in your room. So go ahead."
"george"," Then I asked her if she wanted a drink."
"jerry"," You don't drink."
"george"," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
"jerry"," Good thing the cleaning lady was there."
"jerry"," You're saying something."
"jerry"," What did you say?"
"jerry"," No I didn't."
"george"," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning 
              the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. 
              She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, 
              I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
"jerry"," Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. 
              She's asking me all kinds of questions."
"george"," Oh you told her didn't you."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that 
              you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. 
              What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. "
"george"," Just a little something for Christmas."
"jerry"," On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of 
              those bottles along the way?"
"elaine"," No. I once made out with someone but that was it."
"george"," Alright so you made out with someone."
"jerry"," I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance."
"elaine"," Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear."
"george"," Hide, hide under the desk."
"jerry"," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into 
              an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either 
              telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And 
              those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think 
              he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's 
              finally off the wagon."
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, 
              in 'Death of"
"elaine"," 930"
"george"," Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, 
              what do they"
"jerry"," Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?"
"george"," How many tickets are you paying today?"
"elaine"," See'ya."
"elaine"," This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this 
              progress,"
"elaine"," Yeah"
"elaine"," She."
"elaine"," Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman."
"george"," Yeah, well...."
"jerry"," I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep 
              knee bends,"
"george"," Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket."
"george"," Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things."
"kramer"," Yes! Yes! I won, hey "
"jerry"," So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!"
"elaine"," Here, pay. "
"george"," I was telling you about Noel."
"jerry"," Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos..."
"george"," No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. 
              I have "
"jerry"," You joined the *Polar Bears*?!"
"george"," I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't 
              applaud "
"jerry","  I resent that you said that! That's"
"george"," What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her."
"jerry"," Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the 
              Comedy Club. How's he doing?"
"jerry"," Really, an intervention ..."
"elaine"," 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to 
              you."
"george"," Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
"jerry"," You play a *Hell* of a piano."
"jerry"," It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your 
              fingers before you play?"
"elaine"," So? What happened? "
"jerry"," Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention 
              for him. We're having it here. "
"kramer"," Is Elaine going?"
"jerry"," Yeah, but John invited her."
"jerry"," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe 
              I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
"george"," No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had 
              this terrible phone conversation. "
"jerry"," What was on the list?"
"george"," Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. 
              you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. "
"george"," Shocked?"
"george"," Kind of."
"george"," When you're playing the piano do you think about me?"
"george"," I can't hear you."
"elaine"," What's the order?"
"george","  This man is a genius. Genius!"
"george"," You can't break up with me. I've got hand."
"elaine"," Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three 
        days?"
"elaine"," Hey, have you ever fasted?"
"george"," No, no the full size."
"jerry"," No, no the junior."
"jerry"," Do you believe that guy?"
"george"," He didnt seem too pleased."
"george"," I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night 
        club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics 
        off."
"jerry"," I think Ive played there."
"elaine"," I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast."
"jerry"," Martine?"
"jerry"," In my pajamas? I better get my robe."
"jerry"," Nah, forget it."
"jerry"," Nah, Ill go get the robe. "
"kramer"," Newman! Hes good friends with him. "
"elaine"," Why would he come to George?"
"george"," Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated 
        a woman named Pauline."
"george"," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she 
        ever speak to me again?"
"elaine"," Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that."
"george"," Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going 
        to be. "
"elaine"," Its disgusting."
"george"," Not a plane crash.  Is it a plane crash?"
"elaine"," Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much 
        longer it would be until I get my X-ray."
"jerry"," George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in 
        a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and 
        put it in storage. "
"kramer"," Youre not going?"
"jerry"," Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. "
"jerry"," Thats your big boy."
"jerry"," You swear?"
"george"," Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to 
        apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even 
        know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt 
        get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .."
"newman"," Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell."
"george"," Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? 
        Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?"
"george"," I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting. 
      "
"jerry"," What did she name the kid?"
"george"," when did you get back?"
"jerry"," Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and 
        Gina."
"kramer"," Phew."
"jerry"," All right were coming down."
"kramer"," Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well 
        be getting together."

"kramer"," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned

              have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" 
              and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when 
              you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get 
              girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, 
              you just want more girlfriends."
"jerry"," You're going to make a good father someday."
"george"," Why? What do you mean?"
"jerry"," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's 
              gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's 
              one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna 
              pick us up?"
"george"," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very 
              quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David 
              Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. 
              Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. 
              I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they 
              fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman."
"jerry"," This is your plan?"
"jerry"," I don't think I am."
"jerry"," You're quite mad, you know.  Oh, I don't 
              believe this.  Hey?"
"kramer"," I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful."
"jerry"," This is not a good time."
"kramer"," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. 
              I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells."
"jerry"," Marla, Kramer."
"kramer"," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me."
"jerry"," I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back."
"kramer"," Will you tape it?"
"jerry"," So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin."
"jerry"," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. 
              I don't know what she's doing here now.  I'm sorry. What?"
"jerry"," Go on."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting."
"elaine"," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened 
              to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. 
              So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, 
              it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me 
              this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, 
              big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, 
              like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. 
              You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  
              Ahh. "
"jerry"," So we'll talk about the hooks then?"
"elaine"," Well I didn't know."
"george"," She's a virgin?"
"jerry"," A virgin."
"george"," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.  I'm really hungry."
"jerry"," Yeah, me too."
"kramer"," I'm in. Let's go for it."
"kramer"," What's a Chow Fung?"
"kramer"," Who says I want a noodle?"
"elaine"," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working 
              on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta 
              get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn 
              into farmers suddenly."
"jerry"," Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?"
"kramer"," Hey, you got the food?"
"kramer"," Oh, that's too bad."
"elaine"," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to 
              go that fast."
"george"," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I 
              can't believe, my back."
"jerry"," No, no, would you get up?"
"george"," That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk 
              by. I'll be right back. "
"jerry"," Oh, poor Blossom. "
"jerry"," Yeah, good idea."
"jerry"," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea 
              where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance 
              and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You 
              know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, 
              he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of 
              those big neck collars."
"kramer"," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
"kramer","  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed."
"george","  this is great! He fired her! 
              This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!"
"jerry"," Why did he fire her?"
"jerry"," Why would I leave? This is my apartment."
"jerry"," What else did you say to her?"
"jerry"," I was trying to be."
"elaine","  They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
"george"," ..So, one thing lead to another.."
"jerry"," So, what did she do?"
"george"," I zipped up!"
"elaine","  ..done that."
"george"," So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My 
              back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
"elaine","  I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious."
"george"," Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of 
              days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, 
              why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's"
"jerry"," ""Glamour""?"
"elaine"," Oh, gimme a break.."
"george"," Care to make it interesting?"
"jerry"," Sure, how much?"
"kramer","  Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in 
              on this. "
"jerry"," You'll be out before we get the check."
"elaine"," What? Why?  
              Why?"
"elaine"," Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
"kramer"," No, a thousand!"
"elaine"," No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
"george"," Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
"jerry","  Okay, one-fifty."
"kramer"," Alright. "
"george","  No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I 
              don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, 
              I'll see you later. Yes, of course"
"jerry","  ..Yeah?"
"jerry"," Come on up. "
"george"," Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
"jerry"," Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just 
              waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
"kramer"," Second floor from the top.  See the window on 
              the left?"
"george","  They're naked, the gardeners 
              naked.. the bellhops.  One 
              big nude-a-rama."
"elaine"," What're you looking at?"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah..  what?"
"elaine"," Well, that was fast!"
"",""
"george"," Ma, people can hear you."
"george","  Because I don't want to."

"jerry"," Ah, yeah.. I know."
"jerry"," Goodnight.  Not 
              just a good night - a great night. "

"kramer","  Goood Moorrrnninng!"
"jerry"," She's not there. She's doin' her wash."
"kramer"," So, you're still master of your domain."
"jerry"," I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't 
              sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. 
              Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in"
"kramer","  No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This

"jerry"," Kramer,  get outta my way!"
"kramer"," Yes!"
"jerry"," She's not there!"
"elaine"," John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!"
"elaine","  I said, ""yeah."""
"george"," Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's 
              in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit."
"george"," Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?"
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine"," No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!"
"elaine"," That was good. That was very good."

"jerry","  Come on up! "
"george"," I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just 
              like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!"
"jerry","  Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep 
              one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They 
              looked so good to me, I just had to"
"george"," ..Oh boy."
"jerry"," This is ridiculous."

              I gotta go.."
"george"," No, no, no. He just left."
"elaine","  He left with Marla, the virgin?"
"george"," Yeah."
"george"," I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe 
            with."
"jerry"," No, no no  Elaine what's 
              the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the 
            woman."
"elaine"," Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?"
"george"," Wa, uh, ..."
"jerry"," Kramer, should I call Susan?"
"kramer"," The little man knows all. "
"kramer"," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything."
"kramer"," I don't know about that outfit though. "
"elaine"," Why? What's wrong with it?"
"jerry"," What's that perfume you're wearing?"
"jerry"," Oh my God is that the new perfume? "
"kramer"," Come on lets see - Back to Back."
"jerry"," Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference 
            who's tall. We're all tall."

            Now if you'll excuse us, .."

              the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me 
            you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. "
"jerry"," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody 
              and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue 
            going out with her?"
"elaine"," You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All

              ""Gabardine?"". And I said, ""Yeah."" That was it. 
            "
"george"," Wow, just felt your material? "
"george"," I think that's what the back of closets are for. "
"george"," I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money. 
            "
"jerry"," Did you see that? "
"elaine"," I don't know. "
"jerry"," Today is not cold. "
"george"," She doesn't want to get a bra. "
"george"," I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on 
              knowing that the D is the biggest. "
"elaine"," Well, I felt a call for one. "
"jerry"," Good idea. "
"jerry"," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large 
              intestine. "
"kramer"," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! "
"newman"," South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us 
              mixed up with? "
"jerry"," Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and 
              find out... "
"newman"," Hey, you know this is kind of fun. "
"kramer"," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... "
"jerry"," All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out 
              of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar. "
"jerry"," I might need you to get me a soda. "
"kramer"," Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh? 
            "
"kramer"," Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh? 
            "
"jerry"," You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 
            "
"jerry"," You're an idiot. "
"kramer"," South America? "
"kramer"," I'm hip. "
"elaine"," Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and 
              intensity. "
"elaine"," Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you 
              keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt* 
              nothing comes out... "
"jerry"," Yeah, thanks. "
"newman"," See'ya later. "
"jerry"," The what?? "
"george"," So what, what is so bad about that? "
"elaine"," What is this? "
"kramer"," All right, What about the money? "
"jerry"," Are these seats unbelievable or what?"
"george"," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
"jerry"," You got a problem with paba?"
"elaine"," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver 
              will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem 
              he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
              always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that 
              would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, 
              and the driver is way up there on the stage. "
"elaine"," No no, no no."
"jerry"," Excuse me.  Excuse me?  Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. 
              Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've 
              got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too 
              good for everyone, but it's women like you  oh well, what are you deaf?"
"kramer"," Hey I know how to sign. "
"elaine"," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, 
              but I'm not a terrible person."
"jerry"," That's nice."
"george"," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells 
              me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
"george"," Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find 
              out."
"jerry"," But I thought things were going great."
"george"," Yeah. Well aparently word's out."
"george"," Cracks? What were they saying?"
"george"," Why not. I would be."
"jerry"," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice 
              cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. "
"george"," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
"kramer"," Excellent question."
"jerry"," Really."
"george","  Oh my gosh, I just 
              had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read 
              Gwen's lips for me."
"jerry","  What?"
"george","  Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case 
              closed."
"jerry","  All right."
"george"," If we could just harness this power and use it for our 
              own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
"newman"," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post 
              office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about 
              me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me 
              two hours."
"jerry"," I said pull over by the stop sign."
"george"," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You 
              should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll 
              even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no 
              chance of me overhearing anything."
"george"," So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are 
              going to sleep together?"
"george","  I can read lips. You said let's 
              sleep together."
"george"," Cut it."
"george"," Ow. My eye, my eye."
"jerry"," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a 
              prerequisite."""
"george"," And if I don't call..."
"jerry"," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind 
              of company is it?"
"elaine"," You never get good haircuts."
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," What are you all dressed up for?"
"jerry"," Well I, if it's your day off I really... "
"george"," He massacred you. You look like you're five years old."
"jerry"," What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps."
"jerry"," He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there."
"kramer"," His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying 
              yourself. I'm not going to let "
"jerry"," I don't want you to call him."
"george"," Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just 
              take the small office."
"george"," They gave me the Pensky file."
"jerry"," So it's a nice place to work?"
"elaine"," Come on. Let me see it."
"elaine"," What? No Jerry, you have to go."
"george"," You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day."
"jerry"," That's nice of you to say."
"kramer"," Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it."
"jerry"," I think he knew."
"kramer"," Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a 
              thing. Now come on. Pull yourself "
"jerry"," He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost 
              got caught."
"newman"," Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* 
              free haircuts. And a comb."
"jerry"," You can't unclog it?"
"jerry"," All right. Flush twice."
"jerry"," I'm watching Edward Scissorhands."
"newman"," It was a cinch. Where are you going?"
"elaine"," Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard 
              graduate."
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do 
              I hear, uh, five bucks? "
"jerry"," Who is it?"
"jerry"," Sample?  Newman. Uh, I was there but I 
              was just dropping off a book."
"george"," Mr. Tuttle, you're back."
"george"," Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace."
"george"," Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle."
"george"," Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster 
              isnt the way "
"jerry"," Then he asked you out?"
"jerry"," Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry 
            "
"jerry"," How did you get in?"
"george"," She says we cant go out anymore."
"jerry"," Mmm, succulent."
"george"," Why not? What do I care?"
"jerry"," You know its not like changing toothpaste."
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"elaine"," What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?"
"kramer"," Fungi."
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and 
              the "
"george"," Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will 
              be Brother "
"jerry"," And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother 
              Costanza?"
"kramer"," Sister Roberta gave it to me."
"jerry"," What do you mean she liked you?"
"kramer"," No. I think I picked up on a vibe."
"jerry"," Oh hi."
"george"," She likes you."
"jerry"," Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide 
              in her "
"george"," Well take a look. It might not even belong to her."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to 
              medical school, you "
"george"," What? Nothing."
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," I dont know. I cant believe theyre making 
              me take this test."
"jerry"," Hey, did you talk to the doctor?"
"jerry"," How could you say that?"
"jerry"," Yes. Hes a doctor."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Sister Roberta."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," The Kavorka? Whats that?"
"kramer"," The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar."
"jerry"," Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer."
"jerry"," Oh its your cat! "
"george"," What?"
"george"," Id like a doggie bag for this please."
"elaine"," It's "
"elaine"," Huh, What is that, ha?"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," When did you get that?"
"george"," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?"
"elaine"," You can't bring Pepsi."
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," You are. I can't get that thing  in my car."
"elaine"," Yeah, Jerry, come with me."
"elaine"," You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah!"
"elaine"," Oh, we forgot to pick a number."
"kramer"," Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?<br/>
        GEORGE Just double park"
"george"," Why not?"
"george"," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get 
        cold. "
"george"," You see, ho ho, "
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I 
        make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries."
"elaine"," Me too."
"kramer"," All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't 
        have my wallet."
"kramer"," Oh, I get by."
"jerry"," That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka."
"jerry"," What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole 
        thing's useless."
"jerry"," Well, we've got to get the cinnamon."
"elaine"," I'll have the cinnamon Bobka. "
"kramer"," Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change."
"george"," There's 22 dollars here."
"george"," It's not real. They're all made up."
"george"," Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex."
"elaine"," What is this? "
"elaine"," Excuse me."
"elaine"," It was a little hair. I took it off."
"elaine"," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number."
"george"," I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. 
        Can you comprehend it?"
"kramer"," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part 
        he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?"
"kramer"," They look comfortable."
"jerry"," No, out of the question."
"jerry"," All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out."
"george"," We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble."
"george"," Yes!"
"jerry"," My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie."
"jerry"," I feel like I'm going to throw up."
"jerry"," Fourteen years down the drain."
"george"," We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some 
        car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out."
"elaine"," How was it?"
"jerry"," Oh, no thanks. "
"george"," I had to give it to the liquor store guy."
"jerry"," What for?"
"elaine"," No thanks. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold."
"elaine"," Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working 
              on it! "
"elaine"," But it's a line from that song!"
"george"," No, anything."
"jerry"," She doesn't open?"
"george"," I was curious! "
"jerry"," Isn't that against the law?"
"elaine"," All right.. this is too fun I gotta get back to work."
"george"," Whatever.  Hey new tape recorder?"
"jerry"," Yeah, got it from the bank."
"kramer","  Who wants to have some fun!"
"george"," I do."
"kramer"," Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got at the 
              driving "
"jerry"," Yeah pluggin' along."
"jerry"," Marine biology."
"george"," Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!"
"jerry"," Something huh?"
"george"," George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane 
              DeConn "
"jerry"," Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get 
              in touch with"
"george"," Oh my god he's not kidding."
"jerry"," Now I should tell you at this point she's under the impression 
              the "
"george"," But I'm not a marine biologist!"
"jerry"," I'm aware of that."
"george"," What if she calls. What will I say?"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, 
              Jerry, and"
"jerry"," What, what, what's wrong with you?"
"elaine"," There you are!"
"elaine"," ""War-- What is it go for?""!"
"elaine"," Please."
"elaine"," Well where is it, give it to me!"
"elaine"," One million."
"elaine"," Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!"
"elaine"," Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder."
"jerry"," Oh! Ramscy&lt;?&gt;, great great book if I my say so sir. 
              I almost read the"
"jerry"," Right in the head!"
"kramer"," Come on George, finish the story."
"george"," I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great 
              beast"
"jerry"," Mammal."
"elaine"," Are you in a bad mood?"
"george"," Sand. It's everywhere"
"jerry"," You're not gonna have any? "
"jerry"," You won't even taste it? "
"elaine"," Dump her. "
"elaine"," I got a pebble. "
"kramer"," Do it. Do it. This. "
"elaine"," Like... <i></i> Like this? "
"kramer"," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, 
        dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you 
        on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. "
"jerry"," <i></i> Uh... may I help you? <i></i> "
"kramer"," Real Boss! "
"elaine"," I'm going down there. "
"george"," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second 
        interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking 
        me out to lunch on Friday. "
"george"," You think so? "
"elaine"," I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? "
"george"," So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? "
"jerry"," <i></i> Uh... Excuse 
        me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. "
"george"," <i></i> You know honey for an unadvertised 
        sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. "
"jerry"," The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. <i></i>
"
"kramer"," Hey. These are for you Olive. "
"george"," How could he not have washed? "
"jerry"," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. 
        Turn the water on, do something. "
"kramer"," Is that Elaine mannequin still there? "
"elaine"," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face 
        for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost 
        put his finger up my nose. "
"george"," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired 
        the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. "
"jerry"," So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make 
        a noise? "
"kramer"," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. "
"jerry"," Was it apple? "
"elaine"," Hmm... No you don't. "
"elaine"," You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in 
        your window! "
"jerry"," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint 
        gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right? "
"george"," No, I didn't hear anything. "
"jerry"," Hello. "
"jerry"," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. "
"jerry"," Tell her you lost your itch. "
"george"," Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? "
"jerry"," No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie 
        away for a long long time. "
"elaine"," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, 
        Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me."
"elaine"," Yeah, how about her?"
"kramer"," Great, I'm gonna bring Toby."
"george"," How about Bozo?"
"george"," And the TV show! He had cartoons!"
"george"," Nah, I have asthma. &lt;Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under 
        the table, and George struggles.&gt;"
"elaine"," Nope."
"elaine"," Oh...well..."
"george"," B-O-Z-O? "
"george"," How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?"
"george"," Alright, just forget it."
"george"," Ah, great, great. &lt;sniffs&gt; What's that smell? Smoke? &lt;walks 
        to the kitchen&gt; Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...&lt;smoke 
        boils into the doorway.&gt; FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!"
"george"," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know."
"jerry"," You probably couldn't see because of the smoke."
"george"," In a manner of speaking."
"jerry"," Well, it's honest."
"george"," Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe."
"jerry"," By the way, did you see this? &lt;Hands George a magazine&gt;"
"george"," You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and 
        heckle her. "
"jerry"," Yeah, right."
"george"," Well, go ahead! Do it!"
"jerry"," Why can't I?"
"george"," What...are you using my babies now?"
"jerry"," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice 
        to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to 
        the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, 
        let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'"
"kramer"," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe 
        here, buddy - step on it."""
"kramer"," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he 
        starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' 
        the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and 
        I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop."
"kramer"," Well, it's a valuable appendage."
"elaine"," Why don't you just shut the f-"
"jerry"," Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!"
"jerry"," Gotta go. &lt;heads out on stage&gt;"
"george"," O.k....&lt;is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.&gt;"
"jerry"," I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need ""the clown"" 
        in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse 
        him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo..."
"elaine"," When's Rachel comin' out?"
"jerry"," No lines."
"jerry","  Oh this is interesting."
"kramer"," Yo yo ma."
"elaine"," Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?"
"elaine"," Ugghh."
"elaine"," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
"elaine"," No, I don't think so."
"elaine","  Pretty gorgeous."
"kramer"," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
"george"," Oh you mean face down on her chest."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," You mean she just laid there topless?"
"george"," Well, how good a look did you get?"
"jerry"," Well what'd you mean?"
"george"," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't 
              like"
"jerry"," What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?"
"elaine"," Nobody ever called me breathtaking before."
"elaine"," I can be very clever."
"george"," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've 
              never"
"jerry"," You might have."
"george"," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
"jerry"," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some 
              gum."
"elaine"," Why does it shrink?"
"george"," It just does."
"jerry","  Easy big fella."
"kramer"," Ahhh! "
"elaine"," Some night, huh?"
"elaine"," Some ugly baby, huh?"
"jerry"," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
"kramer"," I'm afraid I couldn't do that."
"kramer"," Heyahhh!"
"jerry","  Hey, look at this guy."
"george"," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
"jerry"," Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
"george"," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
"jerry"," They got some sort of program."
"george"," Hot? &lt;Feels Tartabull's material.&gt; What is this?"
"george"," I can't believe you're not playing in cotton."
"george"," Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. 
        &lt;George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something 
        in his back.&gt;"
"elaine"," Jerry!"
"elaine"," Yeah, she was an editor."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, right."
"elaine"," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing."
"elaine"," Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers."
"jerry"," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got 
        something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you 
        know what I mean."
"kramer"," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing 
        while you defile this woman, you're crazy."
"jerry"," But - "
"kramer"," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world 
        a better place?"
"jerry"," Alright, Kramer!"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won 
        easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
"kramer"," Stop right there."
"kramer"," Oh, come on."
"jerry"," Yes, I poo-poo."
"kramer"," You <i>can't</i> stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and 
        go, but this kid has got something! &lt;Turns to leave.&gt;"
"george"," Well, did you see it?"
"jerry"," See what?"
"elaine"," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. &lt;The phone rings.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?"
"jerry"," Today, right now! Are you in?"
"elaine"," I gotta go. &lt;Hangs up.&gt;"
"kramer"," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you 
        can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a 
        thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
"elaine"," What do you want!?"
"jerry"," What the hell is that?"
"jerry"," What? Why? What happened?"
"kramer"," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic 
        act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? 
        I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that 
        contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who 
        just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! &lt;Kramer 
        turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.&gt;"
"george"," That's a shame. &lt;Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.&gt;"
"jerry"," It's like watching an animal get tortured."
"elaine"," No, I'm sure you do."
"jerry"," I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?"
"elaine"," Ah, no."
"elaine"," They have big salads."
"george"," I've never seen a big salad."
"george"," , we'll see you in a little while."
"elaine"," You can say that again."
"kramer"," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played 
        with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's 
        beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second 
        shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
"elaine"," So what?"
"jerry"," Certainly are. "
"elaine"," I still don't see what the big deal is. "
"george"," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the 
        Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. 
        You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" 
        it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All 
        right.  All right. I "
"elaine"," Hey."
"george"," Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?"
"jerry"," Yeah, so?"
"george"," I mean I'm the one who bought it. "
"jerry"," Yes you did."
"george"," You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        they knew it. "
"jerry"," Obviously."
"kramer"," I'm puttin it on"
"elaine"," That's great George. "
"george"," So did you enjoy your lunch?"
"elaine"," What? What are you trying to say, George?"
"george"," It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. 
        She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. "
"jerry"," Ah, no , I don't think so."
"jerry"," . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?"
"jerry"," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop 
        seeing him. "
"jerry"," What tee?"
"jerry"," No, there's less. "
"jerry"," No,, but thank you. "
"elaine"," I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. "
"jerry"," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. "
"jerry"," Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!"
"jerry"," Noit your type? "
"jerry"," You don't think she's attractive?"
"jerry"," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?"
"kramer"," All right, I'll see you later."
"jerry"," You're going to see Genderson?"
"elaine"," It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil 
        right away."
"elaine"," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. "
"jerry"," What? I'm not looking. Nothing. "
"jerry"," All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman 
        found this unacceptable. "
"elaine"," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You 
        had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought 
        you the big salad. Didn't ya'. "
"kramer","  Hey."
"jerry"," What do you need a hammer for?"
"kramer"," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. 
        Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, 
        you wanna take a ride?"
"kramer"," All right, I've had it with you two. "
"jerry"," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics."
"kramer","  ""Bailing""?"
"jerry"," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?"
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids..."
"elaine"," Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do."
"george"," No, I know I don't have to, I want to."
"elaine"," No, no, unfocus."
"george"," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!"
"jerry"," Was it in the trash?"
"george"," Above the rim."
"jerry"," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse."
"george"," But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!"
"jerry"," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and 
        Bum. You are now a Bum."
"george"," Yes, good for me!"
"jerry"," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it 
        out."
"kramer"," Not yet. But the suspense is killing me."
"jerry","  Well, here we are."
"jerry"," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical 
        world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, 
        there was nothing gymnastic about it."
"jerry"," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of 
        specifics..."
"kramer"," You mean like the uneven parallel bars?"
"jerry"," Could we stop?"
"elaine"," I dunno, at least three weeks."
"kramer","  Hey, what are you doing later?"
"jerry"," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks."
"kramer"," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon."
"jerry"," Yeah, well you're going."
"elaine"," Oh, sorry.  Hello?"
"jerry"," ""Greatest Show on Earth""!"
"elaine","  Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. 
        Lemme just...  Yeah, I've got it...  Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. 
         Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at 
        that poster!"
"elaine"," No?"
"george"," Well, here we are."
"jerry"," Eh, show biz..."
"george"," Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, 
        huh? Whew!"
"elaine"," Oh, Hi."
"elaine"," Really? Grace?"
"elaine"," Thanks"
"jerry"," Hm, really?"
"kramer"," Whoa, you're dating this woman? "
"kramer"," Maybe she's bulimic"
"kramer"," There you go monkey boy."
"george"," Just enjoying watching you."
"george"," You're fresh  You're very fresh. You seem"
"elaine"," Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when 
              I can"
"george"," From the bathroom."
"jerry"," Oh, you think she was refunding?"
"george"," Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what 
            "
"kramer"," Me?"
"kramer"," No, don't, don't make me"
"kramer"," Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? 
              Anything else you "
"kramer"," I can't I can't"
"elaine"," Oh, you'll be playing ..."
"elaine"," ... hiking ..."
"kramer"," Ma?"
"george"," Cosmo?"
"jerry"," Why didn't you just ask her for it?"
"elaine"," That's stealing?"
"elaine"," You found out Kramer's first name?"
"george"," That's right. You ready? "
"jerry"," We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What 
              is it?"
"elaine"," JERRY Cosmo"
"jerry"," Hi, is Sandy here?"
"george"," Wow."
"jerry"," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none 
              of"
"george"," I see."
"jerry"," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
"george"," Can't be done."
"jerry"," I wonder."
"george"," All right, dammit, I'm in."
"jerry"," I couldn't do it without you."
"elaine"," Uh, no, I'm OK."
"elaine"," All right. I'm going I'm going"
"kramer"," My mom Babs."
"jerry"," Uh?"
"kramer"," Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're 
              clean?"
"george"," And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh"
"elaine"," Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy 
              this afternoon."
"jerry"," Hi Cosmo."
"george"," It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I 
              just think you "
"kramer"," Ma!"
"elaine"," Oh. My ballet tickets."

"kramer"," Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something."
"elaine"," Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?"
"kramer"," No, I never realized what an attractive man he is."
"kramer"," You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous 
              woman, she called me up this"
"kramer"," No."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. I think he will."
"kramer"," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's 
              that nut?"
"george"," Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous."
"jerry"," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?"
"elaine"," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open 
              minded."
"elaine"," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's 
              not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if "
"elaine"," Oh it was such a great night. Oh."
"elaine"," He's incredible."

"jerry"," What about a plastic bag?"
"kramer"," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness."
"kramer"," Who's to say it didn't?"
"george"," Yes I did."
"jerry"," What did you say to her?"
"george"," Yes, as I see it."
"jerry"," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?"
"jerry"," Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks 
              away."
"kramer"," Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry."
"jerry"," Well I do."
"jerry"," The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test 
              and that needle's going to be going wild."

              duplicitous, deceptive minds of our"

"elaine"," Well it was easy. Really."
"elaine"," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... 
              changing teams?"
"george"," And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to 
              keep seeing the bald woman."
"jerry"," She's as good as anybody else."
"george"," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you."
"jerry"," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can 
              help me."

"elaine"," Ah. "
"elaine"," Hmm."
"george"," A counter-clockwise swirl."

"jerry","  What is the complication?"
"jerry"," I didn't care."
"jerry"," But someone is waiting for me!"
"jerry"," Then we'll make it the eight."
"jerry"," I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! 
              Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?"
"jerry"," Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?"
"elaine"," That's at the airport, right?"
"elaine"," I said I'll take care of it!"
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like 
              yourself. "
"elaine"," Kramer."
"kramer"," Boy..."
"kramer"," What?"
"elaine"," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. 
              Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!"
"george"," Where were you?"
"jerry"," I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. "
"kramer"," Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? 
      "
"elaine"," What is so funny?"
"kramer"," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could 
        be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG! "
"jerry"," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, 
        that were manufactured in Korea."
"jerry"," This is George, this is Kramer."

        It's your ass buster."
"elaine"," yes,  I suppose, "
"elaine"," How do you know all that?"
"george"," So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my 
        building last night."
"jerry"," Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. 
      "
"kramer"," Hi, here. I made this for your. "
"kramer"," oh, what's that from?"
"elaine"," Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job."
"elaine"," yeah."
"elaine"," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very 
        nice man. "
"elaine"," He's in.<br/>
        Jerry Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement 
        yet.<br/>
        Elaine What's to discuss?<br/>
        Jerry Come on! George is getting married!<br/>
        Elaine Is he happy?<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        At the restaurant! George is coming from the bathroom <br/>
        to sit with his bride-to-be.<br/>
<br/>
        George I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is 
        it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?<br/>
        Susan Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.<br/>
        George Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?<br/>
        Susan Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see 
        if it's taken.<br/>
        George A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs 
        exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. 
        That's a complete breakdown of the system.<br/>
        Susan Can we change the subject, please?<br/>
        George Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?<br/>
        Susan No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about 
        it.<br/>
        George It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that 
        the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.<br/>
        Susan Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.<br/>
        George  How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? 
        She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. 
        We don't even share the same interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, he seems pretty happy.<br/>
        Elaine Well, that's all that counts, I guess.<br/>
        Jerry What's the matter?<br/>
        Elaine Oh, nothin'.<br/>
        Jerry Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.<br/>
        Elaine Well, what do you want me to do?<br/>
        Jerry Well, at least have some reaction to it.<br/>
        Elaine Well, I don't.<br/>
        Jerry Maybe you're a little jealous.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?<br/>
        Jerry No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not 
        him.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, yeah. Right.<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, right.<br/>
        Jerry Lainy!<br/>
        Elaine Jerry!<br/>
        Jerry You don't wanna get married?<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, come on!<br/>
        Elaine Oh, you come on.<br/>
        Jerry You're such..."
"jerry"," You're kidding?"
"kramer"," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it."
"jerry"," Well, I am sure I had a good reason."
"kramer"," I thought I DID!"
"elaine"," I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need 
        of some guidance here."
"elaine"," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole 
        think makes me . . sick."
"elaine"," No, no, it's okay."
"kramer"," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
"kramer"," I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't 
        looked back. "
"jerry"," You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a 
        Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying 
        to get a table and I missed it."
"george"," Hi, "
"george"," The Lowers, really?"
"jerry"," Understand you had a little talk with him too."
"jerry"," Yes he did."
"jerry"," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say."
"elaine"," Mrs. Winston?"
"elaine"," my god, you didn't."
"elaine"," You didn't say this to George, did you?"
"elaine"," Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it."
"george"," Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...<br/>
        Elaine Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple 
        of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.<br/>
        George Well, I guess I'm getting older.<br/>
        Elaine Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, 
        but um, please, please give my best to Susan.<br/>
        George Yeah.<br/>
        Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations.<br/>
        George Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four 
        of us could go out together sometime.<br/>
        Elaine Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.<br/>
        George Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building 
        that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.<br/>
        Elaine Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.<br/>
        George Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold 
        your ground or...uh<br/>
        George Nope. I wept like a baby.<br/>
        Jerry What?<br/>
        George Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some 
        reason, I just burst into tears.<br/>
        Jerry You cried?<br/>
        George I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell 
        you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears 
        are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.<br/>
        Jx,Gx &amp; Kx Hey!<br/>
        Jerry Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.<br/>
        Kramer Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. 
        I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.<br/>
        Jerry Suing? What for?<br/>
        Kramer The coffee was too hot.<br/>
        Jerry It's supposed to be hot.<br/>
        Kramer Not THAT hot.<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
        Rabbi  The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are 
        empty and meaningless.<br/>
        George Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met 
        this guy the other day.<br/>
        Rabbi A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself 
        overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, 
        let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and 
        that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened 
        to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute 
        while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never 
        going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a 
        subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm."

        I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
"george"," Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
"george"," I've coupled! I've coupled! "
"george"," So, uh...wanna double?"
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, 
        you're in horrible shape."
"kramer"," Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
"george"," I'd get tired of it."
"jerry"," How could you not?"
"jerry"," You went all night?"
"jerry"," But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
"elaine"," So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
"elaine"," And the bathroom in your apartment?"
"george"," I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. 
        You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
"george"," I'd kill to be a 32."
"jerry"," She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!"
"george"," You think she's happy?"
"jerry"," Who?"
"george"," I don't think I've ever spoken to her."
"jerry"," Maybe that's why she's happy."
"kramer","  Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from 
        the Alex"
"kramer"," Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus.

"jerry"," Oh, then I'm not worried."
"kramer"," Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious 
        it is. (he"
"george"," I don't chew gum."
"jerry","  Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?"
"jerry"," Alright."
"elaine"," You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. 
        Y... you"
"george"," Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
"jerry"," I thought your parents were outta town?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?"
"elaine","  Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have 
        to sit"
"george","  He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?"
"elaine"," Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out 
        in a hot"
"kramer"," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
"george"," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on 
        the bill"
"george"," I know I gave it to you."
"kramer"," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, 
        sitting"
"jerry"," 's not necessary."
"kramer"," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
"george"," You see that woman on the horse? "
"elaine","  Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was 
        wide open."
"george","  Alright. Alright."
"george"," Aah! Fire!"
"george"," The Jon Voight car is no more."
"george","  Whatever."
"jerry"," Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?"
"kramer"," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses."
"kramer"," No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing 
        wrong"
"kramer"," Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy.  
        I"
"elaine"," Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?"
"elaine"," Hey. Hey everybody."
"jerry"," Lloyd?"
"kramer"," Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, 
        but this"
"elaine"," Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose."
"george"," You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot."
"george"," Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're..."
"george"," Believe me, I am not crazy."
"jerry"," It's a lotta gum!"
"kramer"," Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W."
"kramer","  You don't say."
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick."
"jerry"," So I take it he's spongeworthy?"
"jerry"," Come on. Come on."
"jerry"," Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?"
"jerry"," What stuff?"
"kramer"," Course I will. These are staples."
"jerry"," A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue 
              sauce? Ten "
"kramer"," Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut."
"kramer"," Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of 
              this stuff "
"elaine"," Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?"
"elaine"," I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me 
              here. I don't "
"george"," This is delicious, Mrs. Ross."
"george"," Oh mother of God."
"george"," So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal."
"george"," Yeah. "
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them 
              all "
"jerry"," Bad situation. "
"george"," What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it 
              in there? I"
"jerry"," All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about 
              it. Get the "
"george"," So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back 
              the bread is "
"jerry"," What about Susan?"
"george"," Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half 
              an hour."
"george"," Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the 
              rye bread "
"jerry"," Just put it under your shirt."
"elaine"," Hey. Is that your horse outside?"
"kramer"," You wanna go see him?"
"jerry"," No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound 
              very "
"george"," Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's 
              fine. Fine. "
"jerry"," There's none left?"
"kramer"," Rusty! Rusty!"
"kramer"," The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno."
"kramer"," Just a can. But he really liked it, though."
"george"," Come on!"
"jerry"," "
"george"," Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. "
"elaine","  Oh, cool! Look at that!"
"george"," All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you 
      "
"kramer","  What, this yellow stuff? 
      "
"jerry"," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? "
"kramer"," Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy 
      "
"jerry","  Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there 
      "
"elaine"," Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. "
"elaine"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
"kramer"," From pain, will come pleasure."
"kramer"," Awright, my work is done here."
"elaine","  Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
"elaine"," It took him like ten seconds!"
"jerry"," Sort of a mooching inventory."
"kramer"," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
"george"," How many days was it between encounters."
"jerry"," Three."
"george"," Very curious."
"jerry"," Indeed."
"george","  Not yet, but she's weakening."
"jerry"," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
"kramer"," Alright."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"kramer"," Oh.  So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
"elaine"," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
"kramer"," Boy, I am really surprised at you.  You are 
      "
"elaine"," Kramer!!"
"elaine"," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
"elaine"," Did you have a nice ride?"
"kramer"," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
"elaine"," What? You never told me that."
"elaine"," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
"jerry"," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
"newman"," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
"kramer"," Newman!"
"newman","  Ooh, my cocoa!"
"george"," Fourteen.  Fourteen!"
"jerry","  Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
"jerry"," No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
"jerry","  Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you 
      "
"george","  Please! I have so little!"
"jerry"," ...the food court is closed."
"elaine"," This is my bike!"
"jerry","  Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
"elaine"," What d'you think?"
"elaine"," Hey!"
"george"," Aw c'mon, I'm eating here."
"jerry"," You're really going to town with that turkey there."
"jerry"," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
"jerry"," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned 
      "
"kramer"," Encounter shiatsu."
"elaine"," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
"kramer"," He's a genius. Here we go..."
"jerry"," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
"george"," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
"george"," ...especially a girl. Or a boy."
"george","  Well, that's the name!"
"george"," Alright, you having a good time there?"
"jerry"," I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? "
"george"," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
"jerry","  I'm not engaged."
"kramer","  Got the answer, Jerry. "
"jerry","  Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
"jerry"," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
"george"," Why not?"
"george","  Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
"elaine","  Oh, ah.  Stupid Kramer."
"elaine","  I'm fine."
"jerry"," Hey"
"jerry"," You saw her? What was she wearing?"
"newman"," Alright, let's begin."
"george"," It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it."
"george"," You don't care for Soda?!"
"george"," Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good."
"jerry"," Oh."
"george","  So am I!"
"newman"," ...But I have made a decision.  We will cut the "
"elaine"," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead.  Cut the stupid thing 
      "
"kramer"," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
"elaine","  But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
"jerry"," Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little 
      "
"kramer"," Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
"newman"," Hey!! Help me!"
"elaine","  Oh, look at this!"
"jerry"," Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
"george"," Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda."
"george"," I solve problems. That's just what I do."
"kramer"," Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
"kramer"," No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without "
"jerry"," What arrangement?"
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"elaine"," Ach, maybe."
"elaine"," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike 
      "
"elaine"," You really think he wants the bike?"
"george"," Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl..."
"kramer"," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
"jerry"," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
"george"," The same outfit?"
"jerry"," The exact same outfit."
"george"," Maybe she moved it up in the rotation."
"jerry"," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
"george","  Awright, I'm heading home."
"jerry"," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
"george"," 'Mickey'?  'Mickey'!"
"jerry"," ...You bite it, you bought it."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
"elaine"," This is not the point.  The point is, you just can't 
      "
"kramer","  Digidi."
"elaine","  Kramer! Kramer!"
"george"," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
"elaine"," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
"elaine"," What d'you care?"
"kramer"," What're you talking about?! We had a deal!"
"elaine","  You better give me back that bike!  
      "
"kramer"," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
"elaine"," Yeah Jerry."
"george"," What about Six?"
"newman"," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "
"elaine","  What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!"
"newman"," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
"jerry"," What're you doing? I thought you were changing."
"jerry"," You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?"
"kramer","  Alright. I'll get that money for you in five 
      "
"elaine"," Hey, that's my bike!"
"jerry"," Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid."
"elaine"," What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?"
"george","  Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
"george"," Ech. What else you got?"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
"jerry"," Hey. What's with your neck?"
"jerry"," Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it."
"kramer"," Alright, lean forward, relax."
"elaine","  What? What?"
"kramer","  He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre."
"elaine","  Wha...?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!"
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"george"," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
"george"," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
"george","  Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
"jerry"," Awright, let's see. How about Mug?  Mug "
"george"," Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?"
"jerry"," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
"kramer"," Ah, I got it."
"jerry"," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
"kramer","  Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
"kramer"," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
"jerry"," You cannot buy half a can of soda."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"george"," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
"george","  What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
"elaine","  Oh god! Oh, god.  Kramer!"
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
"kramer"," You got that right!"
"jerry"," Boy, I'm surprised.  I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
"jerry"," Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress."
"jerry"," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
"elaine"," So, that's the situation."
"george","  What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure you do."
"george","  It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
"newman"," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
"elaine"," What?!"
"george","  You know, you're really being very selfish. It "
"george"," Seven!!"
"jerry"," Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?"
"kramer","  Yikes."

      "
"jerry"," Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?"
"jerry"," No."
"jerry"," Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, 
              my father"
"george"," Uncle Leo's having regular sex?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."
"jerry"," 30 years."
"elaine"," You're all grown up."
"george"," Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell 
              are they"
"elaine"," They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?"
"jerry"," All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles 
              made your"
"george"," What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? "
"george"," You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto

"george"," Big news?"
"george"," My parents are moving to Florida!"
"jerry"," Are you kidding?"
"george"," I know!"
"jerry"," We could visit together!"

"jerry"," Can you blame her?"
"elaine"," Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect."
"elaine"," Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!"
"jerry"," What do you recommend?"
"newman"," We'll pay anything. We've got the  "
"kramer"," He couldn't handle that, he's delicate."
"elaine"," Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?"
"jerry"," Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided 
              not to move. "
"george","  I am aware."
"elaine"," Oh, hi, Frank."
"george","  Sit down. Join us, please."
"elaine"," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front 
        of the sign that said ""Costanza""?"
"george"," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's 
        a big executive for Federal Express."
"jerry"," Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just 
        ship it?!"
"kramer"," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that."
"kramer","  Well, we're still, uh, 
        learning the subtleties of the table."
"kramer"," Eleven, corner pocket. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you

"jerry"," Why not?"
"george","  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls 
        looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it."

"george"," Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited."
"jerry"," Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and 
        she made me carry that box?!"
"kramer"," Really?"
"jerry"," Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?"
"jerry"," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. 
        Don't you believe me?"
"jerry"," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally."
"jerry","  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with

"jerry","  How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? 
              Besides it's not a submarine"
"kramer"," why can't you make a higher roof."
"jerry"," No. I know what I want."
"kramer"," Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello."
"george"," You've been demoted."
"kramer"," Yeah. me neither."
"george"," Who!!?"
"jerry"," I just met her, she's incredible."
"kramer"," No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. 
              I have to be unfettered."
"kramer"," All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup."
"kramer"," Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her 
              alley."
"jerry"," Something on your mind?"
"kramer"," No"
"jerry"," You don't like her?"
"kramer"," Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think 
              she thinks. No I can't take it."
"jerry"," That's how it's gonna be."
"kramer","  Is thi oak?"
"kramer"," I'll take it."
"jerry"," I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George!, 
              George Costanza come in here."
"jerry"," You see , I kept up my end of the pact."
"kramer"," Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn 
              to like her, Jerry"
"jerry"," I think I may have made a big mistake."
"kramer","  Too bad you got engaged."
"elaine"," I wonder what happened?"
"george"," I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor."
"george"," ...Are you sure?"
"george"," ...Why?"
"",""
"jerry"," Well, then you're drivin' me wild."
"george","  Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic.  
              You know,"
"george"," So..."
"kramer"," You get the tickets?"
"jerry"," Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?"
"kramer"," Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets 
              up?"
"jerry"," I'm fine.  How was the party?"
"george"," It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music."
"jerry"," Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?"
"george"," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my 
              father's car. '68"
"jerry"," What made him get that thing?"
"kramer"," Brody's in."
"elaine"," Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related."
"kramer"," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell 
              him, Jerry."
"jerry","  Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?"
"kramer"," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, 
              huh?"
"jerry"," Outside!"
"jerry"," What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?"
"kramer"," It's a business."
"jerry"," Kramer. "
"kramer"," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera."
"jerry"," Oh man..."
"kramer"," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that 
              Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!"
"jerry"," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to 
              pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!"
"kramer"," Come on up. It's Brody."
"jerry"," What if I didn't do it right?"
"kramer"," Hey, Brody!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," At Yankee Stadium?"
"kramer","  The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's 
              precious. "
"jerry"," Do you even know what this scene is about?"
"kramer"," Wha? Where?"
"jerry"," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, 
              there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was 
              asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death 
              Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, 
              because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence 
              and strong sexual content you and I take for granted."
"kramer"," Right here. "
"elaine"," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did 
              I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. 
              We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.  What?"
"kramer"," You stink. "
"elaine"," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.  
              Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?"
"elaine"," It's that bad?"
"jerry"," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm 
              gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. 
              And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to 
              talk to 'em."
"kramer"," I know, Jerry. It's okay.  Yeah, look, 
              Brody. Uh,"
"george"," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?"
"jerry"," They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs."
"kramer"," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, 
              he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!"
"george"," Did you say dangerous?"
"kramer"," Yeah. He went at the   Beekman, he tried to land, but they 
              cheesed him."
"jerry"," What're we gonna do?"
"kramer"," Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! "
"kramer"," Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there."
"jerry"," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry 
              again."
"elaine"," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that."
"elaine"," You were big."
"jerry"," Tell him forty and no fork."
"george"," Alright see? We got something there. "
"jerry"," Look at the size of that neon light. "
"kramer"," Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him 
              pick out a"
"jerry"," You use a water pick?"
"elaine"," Hello?"
"elaine"," Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they 
              want?"
"jerry"," Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you 
              go the "
"kramer"," Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy 
              sleeper, "
"jerry"," Yea, that's no good. "
"kramer"," Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets."
"george"," Oh no I'm in already come on. "
"jerry"," And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my... "
"newman"," Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some 
            "
"newman"," Yea, it's the wood that makes it good. "
"kramer"," Really?"
"george"," She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere. 
            "
"elaine"," So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that 
              fur hat by"
"jerry"," Giddee up!"
"elaine"," But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle."
"george"," She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my 
              hat, I think "
"newman"," Gladly. "
"george"," So how do you want to do this?"
"george"," That's a sandwich. "
"elaine"," Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog. "
"jerry"," So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the 
        auto show, I waited for you, you never came."
"jerry"," Well, we barely knew the guy."
"jerry"," That's enough. &lt;They leave. George comes around the corner.&gt;"
"kramer"," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all 
        the other bad checks."
"george"," Fantastic day! Fantastic! "
"jerry"," What happened?"
"george"," Sometimes, once in a while."
"jerry"," When you feel guilty."
"george"," Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, 
        maybe take in a shower fight.  Hey, you know you got a bounced 
        check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"
"jerry"," Yes, I know, I know."
"elaine"," What? Clinging to some scraps?"
"george"," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains 
        of a once great society of hair."
"george"," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. &lt;Notices 
        another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.&gt; So uh, you 
        two shop at the same store?"
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens 
        because you didn't want to go over the bridge!"
"jerry"," Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?"
"elaine"," Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under 
        it? &lt;Kurt shrugs.&gt;"
"elaine"," Here. &lt;Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.&gt; Take a 
        look at that."
"jerry"," It's brown."
"george"," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something 
        nice."
"kramer"," Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight."
"jerry"," Ah ha..."
"kramer"," Only in The United States."
"jerry"," It's two roosters peckin' at each other!"
"kramer"," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like 
        ""American Gladiators."""
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?"
"jerry"," Kramer, give me that rooster!"
"george"," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together 
        with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them, 
        you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. "
"kramer"," I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little 
        Jerry."
"george"," She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. &lt;Kramer 
        comes over with Little Jerry.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hey, how's he doin'?"
"jerry"," Kramer!"
"elaine"," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?"
"jerry"," So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're 
              pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you 
              this thing was good!"
"jerry"," What? Today? Really?"
"george"," Is she socially awkward?"
"jerry"," No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
"kramer"," Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?"
"george","  A frog?"
"kramer"," Hey."

"elaine"," Oh, thanks. I've got plans."
"kramer","  Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get

"jerry"," With a gentleman caller?"

"elaine"," Wanna sit down?"
"george"," Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space 
        underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?"
"jerry"," He's kind of tied up here."
"elaine"," Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller? 
      "
"george"," Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, 
        uh, for an alarm clock?"
"george"," Blanket."
"george"," That is what I want."
"kramer"," Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real 
        grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics 
        Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through 
        a flabby armed spanking machine."
"jerry"," How was the movie?"
"elaine"," After one date!"
"kramer"," Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's 
        see if it will fit in my bedroom."
"elaine"," Oh, all right."

        it done."
"jerry"," Hi."
"kramer"," That's East River."
"jerry"," How could you swim in that water?"
"kramer"," Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there."
"elaine","  Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress 
        back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All 
        right, bye."
"elaine"," What the hell is this? Where are you?"
"elaine"," How did you know? "
"kramer"," Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. 
        I think it might be polluted."
"george"," Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 
        DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT."

"george"," SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!"
"jerry"," Why are you shouting?"

        back here."
"elaine"," Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza."
"kramer"," Hal, .. uh Langerhans."
"kramer"," Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really 
        bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and

"kramer"," That's it."
"kramer"," No, no. She put a stop to that. "
"elaine"," I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta

"kramer"," Hey, watch where you're kicking!"
"elaine"," Kramer."
"george"," There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space."
"jerry"," I saw it."

"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley."
"jerry"," Well...  Welcome aboard."
"jerry"," Booze is not a religion."
"kramer"," Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap."
"elaine"," How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? 
              "
"kramer"," Well, you too seem to have the same taste."
"kramer"," Oh. "
"jerry"," All right, take it easy."
"kramer"," That's right, 'cause they already saw it."

              wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single."
"elaine","  Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought 
              you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye."

              Karen."
"jerry"," Excuse me, Mother?"
"jerry"," Oh. "
"jerry"," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you 
              that he's also telling Catholic jokes."
"jerry"," You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't 
              you?"
"kramer"," Sure."
"jerry"," Huh?"
"jerry"," Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?"
"kramer"," No, Julie. She's the one."
"jerry"," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people 
              children?"
"kramer"," Those people, listen to yourself."
"jerry"," Kramer, he's just a dentist."
"kramer"," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes 
              and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're 
              saying they should have their own schools."
"jerry"," Talk to me."
"jerry"," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big 
              hug. "
"elaine"," So they don't want a baby?"
"jerry"," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all 
              out of proportion."
"george"," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag."
"jerry"," For how long?"
"jerry"," New clothes?"
"george"," I'm still watching them."

"elaine"," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling 
              Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to 
              you?"
"kramer"," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. 
              I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman."
"elaine"," He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon."

"elaine"," Mr Lippman?"

"george"," Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation."
"george"," Find a job. Get an apartment."

"jerry"," Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally 
              unknown person's life."
"kramer"," Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman 
              eats."
"kramer"," Understand?"
"elaine"," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation 
              point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"""
"jerry"," What? Can't I get a moment's peace?"
"kramer"," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to 
              happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and 
              fuller and darker."
"elaine"," We were just trying to help."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," You got any room on that thing?"

"george"," Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? "
"kramer"," Hey, Seinfelds! "
"elaine"," Tomorrow evening, sure. "
"george"," Um, cream soda? "
"george"," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell 
        drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. 
        We need some pudding here! Pudding! "
"kramer"," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your 
        hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood 
        elsewhere, yeah. "
"george"," So eh, what do you say? "
"george"," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked! 
      "
"jerry"," Didn't go for it, huh? "
"george"," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral. 
      "
"jerry"," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about 
        satisfying one of somebody else's. "
"george"," Pudding skin singles. "
"kramer"," What the heck is going on here? "
"elaine"," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your

      "
"kramer"," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. "
"elaine"," Kramer... "
"elaine"," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help 
        out... what's that, some raccoon or something... "
"elaine"," Oh, he's...he's a joy... "
"elaine"," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.  "
"george"," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg 
        and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that 
        would really be the ultimate. "
"jerry"," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. "
"elaine"," No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job 
        or keep a man! "
"george"," And now for the trifecta.  "
"kramer"," We're making sausages. "
"jerry"," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. "
"jerry"," So, the free love buffet is over? "
"elaine"," Hi! This is my friend George. "
"george"," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents 
        in Redding Pennsylvania. "
"george"," That's because it's underwater. "
"george"," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? "
"jerry"," What if I can't keep up? "
"newman"," Hello Jerry. "
"jerry"," Of course. It's garbage."

              you and the next thing - "
"jerry"," &lt;moans&gt;"
"george"," Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?"
"jerry"," Where did you get all these?"
"jerry"," I just want to touch them a little."
"jerry"," You ran over some pigeons? How many?"
"george"," I'm getting nothing."
"jerry"," Yeah, me neither."
"jerry"," Maybe you didn't see him."
"kramer"," It's the Merv Griffin set"
"jerry"," So where are you gonna sleep?"
"kramer"," Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not 
              as hygienic as they appeared on TV"
"elaine"," What? "
"george"," Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off."
"george"," Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!"
"jerry"," Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has 
              this amazing toy collection and last night"
"newman"," Are you married right now?"
"newman"," I told you he was a risk."
"jerry"," ... I think. Have some more wine. "
"george"," &lt;playing with toys&gt; Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.            "
"newman"," We've got no one!"
"kramer"," We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.            "
"kramer"," Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... 
              we got Jim Fowler!"
"george"," I was seven and a half."
"newman"," laughs"
"kramer"," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on 
              out, Celia!"
"newman"," Go girl!"
"kramer"," Are we getting this?"
"elaine"," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for 
              y'a."
"jerry"," Morning. "
"kramer"," You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub. "
"elaine"," No, I don't want this anymore. "
"elaine","  Turn your alarm off!!  "
"kramer"," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? "
"jerry"," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. "
"george"," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to 
        work for him. "
"kramer"," Hey, our meat problems are solved. "
"elaine"," Sara Sitarides? "
"elaine"," This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping 
        since 330 this morning. "
"kramer"," This hallway smells like potatoes. "
"elaine"," I know, I know, this is it.  "
"kramer"," Well, I don't want to either. "
"elaine"," I thought you had done this before. "
"jerry"," Well, I have this neighbor... "
"jerry"," He took out Kruger? "
"jerry"," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, 
        if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. "
"kramer"," I think we are looking half a millimeter. "
"elaine"," Can it cut that thin? "
"kramer"," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. "
"elaine"," Alright, let's do it. "
"kramer"," Well, you're not checked at on it. "
"elaine"," What do I have to know? "
"kramer"," But where does the meat go? <br/>
<br/>
         "
"elaine"," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, 
        yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye. <br/>
         "
"george"," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! "
"jerry"," What are they for? "
"elaine"," Aha. "
"george"," Could she do that at Kruger? "
"george"," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. "
"jerry"," Must I? "
"kramer"," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. "
"elaine"," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. "
"jerry"," Still got it. "
"kramer"," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing 
        a fake beard? "
"jerry"," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office 
        and apologized... "
"kramer"," There, there's your hives. "
"jerry"," She did kind of touch my face. "
"kramer"," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my 
        blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. "
"elaine"," Oh, that's fantastic. "
"george"," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted 
        me to take a photograph for the record. "
"jerry"," Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! "
"george"," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're 
        a doctor and check this guy for moles. "
"elaine"," This is it. I can take this anymore. "
"kramer"," Oh, so far, so good... yeuye... 
      "
"kramer"," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send 
        him to another doctor? "
"kramer"," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. "
"elaine"," Yeah, the address is 78th West... "
"jerry"," So, Kramer pulled it off? "
"kramer"," I don't want this on my conscience. "
"jerry"," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. "
"kramer"," Well, that's weird. "
"jerry"," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! 
        That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's 
        from Dr. Van Nostrand! "
"kramer"," Ohh, that's toxic.  
        Ououou.... "
"george"," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand 
        and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. 
      "
"george"," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, 
        until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out 
        of there! "
"elaine","  George, I just got off a twenty-three hour 
              plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought."
"george","  Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested."
"jerry","  Oh, I'm sure she'll come around."
"kramer","  Well, what happened 
              to your nose?"
"elaine"," I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! "
"elaine","  I know. I woke up with this."
"elaine","  I should.. "
"george"," Yeah.  Sit down there.  Hello, Jerry.  I"
"jerry","  George, we need to talk."
"george"," You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!"
"jerry","  Where'd you get that one?"
"george","  Funny guy!"
"elaine"," Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina 
              slept with  him, he slept with me, I slept with 
              Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all"
"george","  You slept with 
              the groom?!"
"elaine"," George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was 
              acting so weird."
"elaine"," Okay.  I slept with the groom."
"elaine"," Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?"
"elaine","  
              G'night, Jugdish. "
"kramer"," Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!"

"george"," Hey."
"newman","  You see, my dear, all certified 
              mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified."
"kramer"," Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about 
              zip codes They're meaningless! "
"kramer"," Newman, wait!"
"newman","  Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable 
              birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true."
"kramer"," Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?"
"newman"," Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my 
              wish yet.."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."

              lined up for me, do ya?"
"jerry"," Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition 
              from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need

"george"," An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people 
              for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like 
              one month off."
"jerry"," Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' 
              him."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, 
              if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 
              'Enjoy the show.'"
"elaine"," I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act."
"kramer"," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with 
              powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of 
              cards and your bankroll."
"kramer"," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?"
"kramer"," Well, yeah."
"george"," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're 
              gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper."
"jerry"," Except the store's in Delaware."
"george"," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull 
              for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for 
              your money."
"jerry"," But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow 
              here than here."
"george"," All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet 
              &amp; Lows."
"george"," A man carries a wallet."
"jerry"," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think 
              I'm onto something."
"elaine"," So, George... did you get the chair?"
"george"," No, I don't have it yet."
"jerry"," So, we're givin' him nothing?"
"elaine"," Hey, Joe Mayo."
"elaine"," So Joe Mayo had the same coat."
"george"," And you threw it out the window?"
"elaine"," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane."
"george"," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
"george"," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment."
"jerry"," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?"
"jerry"," Ow! Sharp key."
"newman"," Well, there's very little sleeping going on."
"kramer"," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
"newman"," No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost."
"kramer"," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
"jerry"," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, 
              and I want to keep that weight off."
"jerry"," Oh."
"jerry"," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split 
              it three ways."
"newman"," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from 
              this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
"newman"," Sorry. Climbers, keepers."
"newman"," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?"
"newman"," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the 
              whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of 
              the apartment, where I would be"
"kramer"," Huh?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," What about Jerry?"
"kramer"," All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's 
              yours."
"jerry"," Is that right?"
"kramer"," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, 
              I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about."
"jerry"," All right."
"kramer"," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when 
              you gave it to me."
"george"," It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?"
"jerry"," You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out."
"george"," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? 
              It was your suggestion."
"george"," I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked."
"jerry"," Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!"
"jerry"," All right."
"kramer"," Ahh...."
"george"," My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!"
"jerry"," Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite 
              fur coat."
"jerry"," Oh, thanks."
"kramer"," All right, you're not fancy!"
"jerry"," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy."
"jerry"," Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!"
"elaine"," What is that?"
"jerry"," Heeyyy!..."
"jerry"," What did you wanna be?"
"elaine"," Jerry , She looks exactly like you."
"jerry"," She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it 
              to be because of me. It should be the"
"kramer"," Aahh...Who's Janet?"
"kramer"," Well how should I have ""broached the subject"""
"jerry"," Yeah! Because of you."
"jerry"," Of course , I stink , you stink. It's show bizz. everybody 
              stinks.."
"jerry"," Oh! I think we're at the bottom."
"george"," No..."
"kramer"," What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors 
              about George has a new fem-Jerry"
"jerry"," Well what does this mean?"
"kramer"," That's the idea."
"jerry"," Oh! you just startin' now?"
"elaine"," No it isn't."
"elaine"," Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The 
              New Yorker."
"elaine"," ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons."
"jerry"," There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her"
"jerry"," some mouthwash , a hat , something."
"jerry"," I get it."
"jerry"," Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks."
"jerry","  That's it I'm calling 
              in the big guns."
"elaine"," A Ziggy?"
"george"," Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about 
              something and fast or I'm in very "
"george"," I'm losin' it"
"george"," Your hair?"
"jerry"," Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's 
              got nothing."
"kramer"," ...All right ..Starting now......"
"george"," like that "
"jerry"," You mean like.. "
"george"," Exactly.."
"jerry"," Hmmmm..."
"",""
"kramer"," Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call."
"jerry","  Hey, there's Leo."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name.."
"",""
"george","  What do you want to 
              hear?"
"george"," I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-"
"jerry","  Thank you very much."
"jerry","  Oh, right. The big party.."
"elaine"," Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going 
              down!"
"kramer","  What about the homeless?"
"kramer"," Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked 
              out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for 
              are motivated,"
"newman","  Rusty."
"kramer","  You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No 
              offence."
"newman"," I think he stealing our rickshaw!"
"kramer"," Well, then, he's out!"
"george"," Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book."
"george"," It says that on the computer?"
"jerry"," '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?"
"jerry","  
              Hello?"
"jerry","  You're stealing too?!"
"jerry","  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all 
              homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months."
"newman"," We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. 
              I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords."
"george"," I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try 
              on pants."
"jerry","  Not underpants."
"jerry","  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!"
"jerry"," Nightmares. You?"
"newman"," It's entirely possible."
"jerry","  Good night, Newman."
"",""
"newman"," There it is!"
"kramer"," Rusty!"
"newman"," You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for 
              us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after 
              all, it is a conveyance."
"kramer"," Yes, that's true."
"george"," Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off."
"george","  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's 
              rediculous."
"elaine"," Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm 
              the office hero."
"newman","  Boy.. Boy. Kramer!"
"kramer"," Woah! Wait!"
"",""
"george"," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That 
              way, everything is even."
"jerry","  You defile one book, steal 
              another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?"
"jerry"," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee 
              messiness."
"jerry"," So they just gave you this?"
"kramer"," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running 
              around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off."
"kramer"," Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall."
"george"," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--"
"jerry"," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--"
"george"," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--"
"jerry"," Sure.  How about this one?"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased."
"kramer"," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper 
              in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you."
"george"," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that 
              I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. 
              H-hello?"
"george"," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If 
              I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
"jerry"," Hello?"
"jerry"," So join in."
"elaine"," No, sir, I can't."
"jerry"," Well Lisi, that was another-"
"jerry"," Riverside Park."
"george"," And you automatically sleep with her?"
"jerry"," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--"
"elaine"," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke 
              Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
"jerry"," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her 
              the wrong message."
"elaine"," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage."
"kramer"," Lock and load."
"george"," No. I--I paid for it."
"george"," The outlet?"
"jerry"," You are not dumb. Don't say that.."
"george"," Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery 
              Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will 
              be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone."
"jerry"," Oh. Sounds great."
"elaine"," Oh, hello."
"george"," What are you guys doing?"
"kramer"," George, they closed up."
"george"," Holes! I need holes!"
"george"," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's 
              got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
"jerry"," You mean like...Liza!"
"george"," That's a myth."
"jerry"," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
"jerry"," You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Oh."
"kramer"," Jerry, where have you been?"
"kramer"," I don't know."
"jerry"," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all 
              the new numbers are 646."
"jerry"," Here we go. "
"elaine"," Hello?"
"jerry"," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation 
              so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
"jerry"," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and 
              we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some 
              what sophisticated."
"jerry"," The store."
"jerry"," She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!"
"kramer"," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're 
              Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the 
              menus from some restaurants."
"elaine"," Which ones?"
"kramer"," Ah!"
"elaine"," Ahem. 646? What is this?"
"kramer"," Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you 
              know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
"jerry"," Hey, T-bone!"
"elaine"," Yeah? Well, so am I!"
"george"," Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
"kramer"," Well, what's the matter?"
"jerry"," Koko?"
"george"," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. 
              First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
"jerry"," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like 
              I'm seein' a prostitute."
"jerry"," Ooh."
"kramer"," Well, now I can't see Jerry."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," I was talking to him."
"kramer"," Come on. What'd he say?"
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Eh! Come on. What did you say?"
"jerry"," I hate the counter."
"jerry"," Some new kind of pie."
"jerry"," I didn't hear anything."
"jerry"," But you didn't really do any work."
"jerry"," Well, who took the nap?"
"jerry"," So is this a breakup/quitting?"
"elaine"," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
"elaine"," Oh...nuts. "
"elaine"," He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be 
              to have a real family."
"jerry"," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to 
              do."
"jerry"," I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 
            "
"jerry"," Here. I got your money."
"george"," There's no Gammy."
"elaine"," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting 
              shellacked."
"george"," Those nachos are killing me."
"elaine"," Watch out for that maroon Golf."
"jerry"," Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out."
"kramer"," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your 
              window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass."
"elaine"," Oh, no, I couldn't do that."
"george"," I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have 
              calmed down the nachos."
"kramer"," No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso."
"jerry"," Maroon Golf."
"elaine"," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am 
              going somewhere else."
"george"," The movies. Blimp is playing right there."
"jerry"," You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid 
              line?"
"elaine"," That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. 
              Bye again."
"jerry"," What's that?"
"george"," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here."
"jerry"," What's that on your forehead?"
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!"
"jerry"," Not you! The guy in the Amigo."
"george"," Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants."
"elaine"," Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through 
              here."
"kramer"," Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment."
"kramer"," Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?"
"jerry"," Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?! "
"george"," Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! 
              Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak 
              up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter."
"elaine"," Oh, god! Let us out!"
"george"," That wasn't a laser pen."
"kramer"," See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?"
"george"," Art."
"jerry"," Mr. Vandelay, of course."
"george"," Pennypacker. Varnsen."
"jerry"," Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
              and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?"
"kramer"," Jerry, that's in Sweden."
"kramer"," Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, 
              shall we go home?"
"jerry"," Hey, there's Elaine."
"george"," I've been to the movies."
"jerry"," Not this movie."
"george"," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
"jerry"," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What is that?"
"george"," It's dismissive."
"jerry"," It's pompous."
"george"," Who's he?"
"jerry"," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
"george"," When? "
"jerry"," Today, like right now."
"george"," ""Jerry""!"

"george"," I won't feel like a writer."
"jerry"," You're not a writer."

"george"," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
"jerry"," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
"jerry"," Definitely."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
"elaine"," You said it was an emergency."
"george"," He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it."
"george"," Ma?!"
"jerry"," Hey - how was the beach?"
"kramer"," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
"jerry"," Yeah, only for a while."
"kramer"," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
"elaine"," This is all very exciting."
"george"," So? Where are we going?"
"jerry"," It's still bleak."
"elaine"," What about Switzerland?"
"jerry"," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
"kramer"," Oh yeah - oui oui."
"elaine"," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
"jerry"," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
"jerry"," That's a shame."
"elaine"," Will you turn around?"
"george"," Why?"
"elaine"," I don't know - it just is."
"george"," Kramer, what are you doing?"
"jerry"," Still got water in your ear?"
"kramer"," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
"george"," Kramer!"
"kramer"," It was an accident."
"george"," There's something I have to tell you."
"jerry"," What? What is it?"
"elaine"," No no - me first."
"george"," We're straightening out!"
"jerry"," We'll see you later."
"elaine"," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
"george"," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
"jerry"," Alright, I'll feel him out."
"jerry"," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
"kramer"," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
"elaine"," Forget it."
"elaine"," I know."
