"SpongeBob","  There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. With a Help Wanted sign in the window! For years I've been dreaming of this moment! I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye , lay it on the line and... I can't do this!  Uh, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Where do you think you're going?"
"SpongeBob"," I was just..."
"Patrick"," No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough!"
"Patrick"," Whose first words were ""may I take your order""?"
"SpongeBob"," Mine were."
"Patrick"," Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?"
"SpongeBob"," I did."
"Patrick","  Who's a, uh who's uhh, oh! Who's a big yellow cube with holes?"
"SpongeBob"," I am!"
"Patrick"," Who's ready?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"Patrick"," Who's ready?"

"SpongeBob"," I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! "
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go self! "
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs!  Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- "
"SpongeBob"," Permission to come aboard, captain!  I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew  and now I'm ready.  So, uh, when do I start?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. "
"Squidward","  No. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew! Go out and fetch me...  a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula...  with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments,  and, uh... turbo drive!  And don't come back till you get one! "
"SpongeBob","  Aye aye, captain!  One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Carry on!  We'll never see that lubber again."
"Squidward"," You're terrible! A hydro-what? "
"Mr. Krabs"," That sounded like hatch doors!  Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells... smelly.  Anchovies."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Anchovies! "
"Squidward"," Please, please, quiet!  Is this any way to behave, hmmm?"
"Squidward"," Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? "
"SpongeBob","  Barg'N-Mart, Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!"
"Squidward"," One single file line was all I asked!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward!  We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward!  I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. "
"Squidward"," Help!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! "
"Mr. Krabs"," This is the end! Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Oh Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula? "
"SpongeBob"," That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with  port-and-starboard attachments, and lets not forget the turbo drive!  Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen!  Who's hungry?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants! Welcome aboard! "
"Squidward"," B-but, but Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!"
"Squidward","  Hooray, Mr.-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip-hip!"
"Squidward","  Hooray. M-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip-hip!"
"Squidward","  Hooray. Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. "
"Patrick"," Good morning, Krusty Krew!"
"Squidward"," What would you like to order, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," One Krabby Patty, please. "
"Patrick"," "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee!"
"SpongeBob","  Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is!  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble. "
"SpongeBob"," Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!"
"Sandy"," Hold on there, little square dude! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you like karate too!  So, uhh, what's your name?"
"Sandy"," Sandy.  So what do y'all call yourself?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm SpongeBob! "
"Sandy"," Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Oh yeah? Watch this! "
"Sandy"," I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah!  Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?"
"Sandy"," Why, that's my air helmet."
"SpongeBob"," May I try it on?"
"Sandy"," Heck no. I need it to breath! I gotta have my air."
"SpongeBob"," Me too! I love air! Air is good."
"Sandy"," No kidding?"
"SpongeBob"," Why, ""air"" is my middle name! The more air, the better! Can't get enough of that air."
"Sandy"," Shee-oot. How about coming over tomorrow for tea and cookies then?  Don't be late!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I just met this girl! She wears a hat full of... air!"
"Patrick"," Do you mean she puts on ""airs""?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess so."
"Patrick"," That's just fancy talk. If you want to be fancy, hold your pinky up like this! The higher you hold it, the fancier you are!"
"SpongeBob","  How's that?"
"Patrick"," Higher!"
"SpongeBob"," Like that?"
"Patrick"," Now that's fancy! They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants!  Remember When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks pal. "
"Sandy"," Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi-ya, Sandy. Its me, SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," Hold on a sec, I'll let you in."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here."
"Sandy"," Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air."
"SpongeBob","  No water?"
"Sandy"," That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water."
"Sandy","  Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah!  That's not in. In!  You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.  This is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest...  ...purest...  ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath.  And that's my oak tree.  It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees?  Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I...  ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Lets have that tea now. "
"Patrick"," Pinky! Pinky!"
"SpongeBob","  I brought you some flowers."
"Sandy","  For me? How sweet!  You okay?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, I'm okay."
"Sandy"," You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit."
"SpongeBob"," I cant imagine why."
"Sandy"," Can I get you anything?"
"SpongeBob"," Water would be nice."
"Sandy"," I'm gonna to put these in a vase."
"SpongeBob"," Take your time.  I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh! "
"Sandy","  I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree!"
"Patrick","  When in doubt, pinky out."
"SpongeBob","  I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... "
"Sandy"," Why, these flowers are just beautiful!  They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice, cold water.  So tell me about yourself.  It must be fascinating being a sea critter.  SpongeBob?  Oh, there's the cookies.  Be right back."
"SpongeBob","  I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I NEED IT!!!!! "
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm a quitter! "
"Patrick","  You can't leave now! You'll blow it!"
"SpongeBob","  Air is not good, Patrick! Air is not good!"
"Patrick","  You're just being shy.  Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine.  I won't let you blow... this.  What kind of place is this?!  There's no water in here!"
"SpongeBob","  I tried to tell you!"
"Patrick"," We've got to get out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," You're... doing it... wrong..."
"Patrick"," Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. "
"Sandy","  Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this..."
"Sandy"," There, that ought to do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda' asked.  I propose a toast, to new friends!  Hold on a second.  I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up! "
"SpongeBob","  Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. "
"Squidward"," Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure thing, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Squidward"," And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. "
"Squidward"," I thought I... Wha?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward! Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents."
"Squidward"," Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles."
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh!"
"Squidward"," Oh, puh-lease! I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? "
"Patrick"," Good morning! "
"Squidward"," Oh, boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?"
"Patrick"," Hmm, how much is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Only a quarter."
"Patrick"," Sounds reasonable.  Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," Ah, one quarter. "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. "
"Squidward"," Hmm, business is booming.  How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. "
"SpongeBob"," One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.  Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents."
"Patrick"," Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter?  Thanks. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique!  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... "
"Patrick"," Oooh.  Ah! "
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," And now... with two hands! "
"Patrick","  It's a giraffe! "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-"
"Squidward"," Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!"
"SpongeBob"," We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art! Watch carefully.  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times one, two, three. Theeeen pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... "
"Squidward"," That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  Bubbles.  Art. "
"SpongeBob"," That'll be 25 cents, sir."
"Squidward"," Ah, whoa, what?  Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?"
"SpongeBob"," We also offer lessons for beginners. "
"Squidward"," Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble?  Here's your 25 cents!  Watch and learn.  Uhh... wait, wait, wait.  One more time. Here. Wait.  Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, remember the technique.  Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back...."
"Patrick"," Hey! Technique, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Spin around like thi— Like this...  Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three..."
"Patrick"," The pelvic woo!"
"SpongeBob"," Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the ""Woooooo!"" Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Listen to Sponge!"
"SpongeBob"," Technique! Technique! Technique!"
"SpongeBob","  You're not doing the technique."
"Patrick"," Technique."
"Squidward"," Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique!  First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Squid! That was so good!"
"Patrick"," Squid is number one!"
"Squidward"," I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that! "
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Squidward"," Now that's a bubble!"
"SpongeBob"," You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, technique."
"Squidward"," Technique? Hah! SpongeBob, you don't think I created that  beautiful work of art with your help?  Come on, it's in my genes."
"Squidward"," Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I rock. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... "
"Squidward"," ...genius. "
"SpongeBob"," What a great day.  Hey, Sandy! Look!  I'm Sandy!  Hey Sandy, who am I?  Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? "
"Sandy"," Hey, Larry."
"Sandy"," Sure.  Well come on, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob","  Coming. "
"SpongeBob"," Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? "
"SpongeBob"," All right, stand back, everyone. "
"Sandy"," Y'all watch this!  Way to go, Larry! "
"SpongeBob"," Could I borrow a couple of these?"
"Sandy"," Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? "
"SpongeBob"," I got it!  Incoming!  Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?"
"Sandy"," Okay, here it comes! "
"SpongeBob"," I could use a hand here! "
"Sandy"," You okay, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess so...  ...except I ripped my pants! "
"SpongeBob"," I'll take a banana split."
"SpongeBob"," That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? "
"SpongeBob"," How about ripple?  No, thanks, already got one!  Is that a burger you're eating?"
"SpongeBob"," You know what would go good with that?"
"SpongeBob","  Ripped... pants.  Ripped pants a la mode!  Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Come closer.  I need... I need..."
"SpongeBob","  A tailor.  Because I ripped my pants! "
"Sandy"," That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! "
"SpongeBob","  Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting.  Let's see...  ""Lifting weights - big laugh,"" ""Frisbee in face - kills,"" ""Surfing - knocks 'em dead,"" ""Pretending to drown,""  No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody!  Not ripped pants!  Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We blew it, pants."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! "
"SpongeBob"," Ouch. "
"SpongeBob"," I lost my best friend."
"SpongeBob"," When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants. "
"SpongeBob","  ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! "
"Sandy"," Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. "
"SpongeBob"," Absolutely, buddy. "
"SpongeBob","  I think I've got it! Wait a minute... "
"Squidward"," Hm."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, we're jellyfishing."
"Squidward"," Of course you are. Bye now. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! We made a net especially for you!  Do you want to come with us?"
"Squidward","  Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends SpongeBob and... uh..."
"Patrick"," Patrick."
"Squidward"," Right. But I can't. Bye bye."
"SpongeBob"," Next time?"
"Squidward"," Oh sure, right! Whatever.  Like that'll ever happen."
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun."
"Patrick"," Maybe he doesn't like us."
"SpongeBob"," No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. "
"Squidward"," Jellyfishing.  Oh, I'll go.  I sure had them going.  Stupid jellyfish! Beat it!  Ow..."
"SpongeBob"," Squid's back! "
"Patrick"," Yello?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!"
"Patrick"," Oh great! Who are they? "
"SpongeBob"," Us!  Let's go!  Welcome home, Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Merry Christmas!"
"SpongeBob"," We're gonna make this your best day ever!  Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. "
"Patrick"," How about some soup on your best day ever?  Here we go!  Oh, it's a little hot. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever.  How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet.  Sorry, my lips are a little dry. "
"Patrick"," Music isn't best either!"
"SpongeBob"," But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! "
"SpongeBob"," This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured.  No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Pat, fix him up while I find him a good specimen."
"Patrick"," Firmly grasp it in your hand.  Firmly grasp it.  Firmly grasp it!  That oughta do it. "
"SpongeBob"," There's one in position. Ready... set... go! "
"Patrick"," I think we gotta show him how it's done. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey look! Squid's doing it! "
"Patrick"," This guy's good."
"SpongeBob"," He's a natural!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go!"
"Patrick","  Yeah, you got it, Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it, Squid! See what you've been missing?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, you got, Squid!"
"Patrick","  You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can do that distance! Use that net!"
"SpongeBob"," Be the net!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! You're feeling it Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that, Squid! Go, go, go!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!"
"Patrick"," It's in the bag!"
"SpongeBob"," This is really your best day ever, isn't it?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Well...  Thought yesterday went...  pretty well, don't you think?"
"Patrick"," I had fun."
"SpongeBob"," Me too. "
"Patrick"," Here comes Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, great.  Hey Squid! How about that...  ...best day ever?"
"Patrick"," There's always tomorrow! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward.  Um, we got you a present!  It's the jellyfish. "
"Patrick"," You know, from yesterday!"
"SpongeBob"," You're not still mad, are you? "
"Patrick"," Yup, he's still mad. "
"Squidward"," Ow."
"Squidward","  One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. "
"SpongeBob"," Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. "
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard. "
"Squidward"," Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?"
"SpongeBob"," Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose! "
"Squidward"," You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha...you really are. ."
"SpongeBob"," Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty.."
"Squidward"," Okay, give it to me.  Come on SpongeBob, stop it!"
"SpongeBob","  I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is...  Plankton! Stealing me booty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!"
"Plankton"," You'll pay for this, Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh..Plankton, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug?  Okay.  Enough lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work! "
"SpongeBob","  Okay Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good night, me boy! "
"Plankton","  Psst...young man.  Yes, over here. Come on boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean...hi. "
"SpongeBob"," Plankton? What do you want?"
"Plankton"," I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Um...no."
"Plankton"," Acquaintances?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Plankton"," Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?"
"SpongeBob"," I...guess so."
"Plankton"," You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ding!  Sparkle, sparkle."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it."
"Plankton"," It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? ."
"SpongeBob"," A booster seat? "
"Plankton"," Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those  tender...delicious...Krabby Patties! "
"SpongeBob"," You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow."
"Plankton"," Gee, and I thought you were stupid."
"SpongeBob"," You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!"
"Plankton"," Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! "
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Gary. "
"Plankton","  SpongeBob, you will be mine! "
"Plankton"," It should be in here...but where?  Where? Oh...  This will be the beginning of the end!  Ouch! Stupid brain...  Come back here you swine!  That's it, brain, you're going down!  Yes, yes, that's grand.  And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan.  And now it's time for a little wakey-uppy. "
"SpongeBob"," Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today. "
"Plankton"," I have you now! "
"SpongeBob"," Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!"
"Squidward"," Be quiet, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Help!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? "
"Plankton","  Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player."
"Squidward"," Mediocre? "
"Plankton"," You pretentious little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! "
"SpongeBob"," Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?"
"Plankton"," Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! "
"SpongeBob"," Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never! "
"Plankton","  Toot toot! How about a little take-out?"
"SpongeBob"," No, never!  You can't fool me Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula! "
"Plankton"," You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no!  There's no one here."
"Plankton"," Don't remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob. This is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? "
"SpongeBob"," I must fight! "
"Plankton"," No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. "
"Plankton"," Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? "
"SpongeBob"," I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty."
"Plankton"," Mmm..."
"SpongeBob","  With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. "
"Plankton"," Steamy... "
"SpongeBob"," I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. "
"Plankton"," Yes... yes... yes!  Come to papa!  Oh boy... "
"Plankton"," Well, this stinks."
"SpongeBob"," Well patty, I guess we can go home now. "
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!  Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty!  Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries."
"Squidward"," Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created.  Congratulations, chef! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood."
"SpongeBob","  Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, what are you talking about?"
"Patrick","  Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!"

"Patrick"," Friend?  Friend..."
"Squidward","  Yeah, Patrick, we're friends...  just friends. "
"Patrick"," So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? "
"Squidward"," Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo."
"Patrick"," Clarinet? I love music!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary?  Gary? "
"Squidward"," Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor."
"Patrick","  Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! "

"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy?  Oh, ho-ho, so this is what I find, huh? My best friend and my ex-best friend and...  ...rubber bath toys!"
"Patrick","  Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!"

"Squidward"," Come on in! You look stunning. "
"SpongeBob"," I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy...  Say, what gives? I'm not sitting near that maniac!"
"Patrick"," Me neither! This was a setup!"
"Squidward"," I thought you two were my best friends."
"Squidward","  Well, how about some soda, guys? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, please!  Thanks, friend.  "
"Patrick"," How about some for your best friend? "

"Squidward"," Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more.  Why don't you just stay here and chat?  I should just walk away right now.  What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? "
"SpongeBob"," Guess what, Squidward? "
"Patrick"," Me and SpongeBob are friends again!"
"Squidward"," Great, now go be friends somewhere else."
"SpongeBob"," Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?"
"Squidward"," No! Out! "
"SpongeBob"," Psst, I think he's jealous."
"Patrick"," How pathetic. "
"Squidward"," Ohhhhh, my back."
"SpongeBob","  This is it, Gary!"
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Ready to move?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!"

"SpongeBob"," The bow. "
"SpongeBob"," Stern. "
"SpongeBob"," Starboard.  Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, in this boat right here?  Is it time already?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah, absolutely. "
"SpongeBob"," 1924?"
"SpongeBob"," The boat?"
"SpongeBob"," Floor it?"
"SpongeBob"," Floor it?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, floor it."
"SpongeBob","  I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, thirty-eight. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary, I'm not walking."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over."
"SpongeBob","  What is it, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  I got a surprise for you."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood."
"Patrick","  Get out of bed. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, now what, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Go to your closet for a surprise. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, I'm at the closet."
"Patrick","  Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," Patrick SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about."
"Patrick"," What's the problem?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven..."
"SpongeBob"," ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight."
"Patrick"," Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. "
"SpongeBob"," How are we going to do that? "
"Patrick"," Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? "
"Patrick","  Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing.  Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing!  Testing!  Test. Do you read?!"
"SpongeBob"," Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over."
"Patrick","  Got your apple ready?  Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on.  Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. "
"SpongeBob"," Moo."
"Patrick","  No, no, get in the boat!  Give her the apple. "
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, ma'am. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh..."
"Patrick","  Start the boat. "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, it's only the boat."
"SpongeBob"," I... I think so."
"SpongeBob"," 1924?"
"Patrick","  No, no, put it in drive."
"SpongeBob"," Put it in drive?"
"SpongeBob","  Floor it?"
"Patrick","  Freeze, mister!  Big toe. "
"Patrick","  Okay, you're coming to your first turn. "
"Patrick","  Left! "
"Patrick","  Right! "
"Patrick"," Cheating! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," I think I'm cheating."
"SpongeBob"," I think I am cheating!"
"SpongeBob"," I do have an antenna under my hat!  There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!"
"Patrick"," What?! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater..."
"SpongeBob"," No... I'm cheating...!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheating!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!"
"SpongeBob"," No...!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheater...! "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike."
"SpongeBob"," Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!"
"Squidward","  Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home."
"SpongeBob"," I got it, I got it! Coming. "
"Squidward"," Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you?  Pizza?  Um... Of course we have pizza."
"Squidward"," Uhh, Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Our delivery Squid will bring it right over. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza.  We don't deliver."
"Mr. Krabs"," We don't deliver,  but you do."
"Squidward"," Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great idea! Take him with you. "
"Squidward"," That's not what I had in mind!"
"SpongeBob"," Front end... check. Antenna...  check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker...  ...check.  Tire pressure!  ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever."
"Squidward"," Good, then you drive."
"SpongeBob"," I can't. I'm still in Boating School."
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner."
"SpongeBob"," Well, yeah, but..."
"Squidward"," Just do what you do in school."
"SpongeBob"," Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me."
"Squidward"," Back it up."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Back... it up."
"SpongeBob"," Right, back... it up. "
"Squidward"," Back it up!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay."
"Squidward"," Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse.  and 뒤로가 ]"
"Squidward"," Back it up!"
"SpongeBob","  Backing up! Backing up! "
"Squidward","  No! SpongeBob! You did it wrong! Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel! Give me it!"
"SpongeBob"," Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up!  Backing up. Backing up. Backing up.  Backing up."
"Squidward"," Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think were out of gas. And you know what else?  We're in the middle of nowhere!"
"SpongeBob"," And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold."
"Squidward"," And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, we can still deliver it on foot. "
"Squidward"," Ow, ow, ow."
"SpongeBob","  The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza..."
"Squidward"," ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa.  SpongeBob? What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob","  Its an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this is no time for..."
"SpongeBob"," Shh, shh, shh. It's working."
"Squidward"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob","  Truck! 16 wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked.  Whee... eee... "
"Squidward"," He's stopping! He's stopping! "
"SpongeBob","  The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza  is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. "
"Squidward"," Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!"
"SpongeBob","  I can't, it's for the customer!"
"Squidward"," Well, who cares about the customer?!"
"SpongeBob"," I do!"
"Squidward"," Well, I don't!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Let go of that pizza!"
"SpongeBob"," No! "
"Squidward"," Ow.  SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!"
"SpongeBob"," No! It's for the customer!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! "
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Hang onto the pizza!  Hey! Hey!  Where's the road? Where's the road?  We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go?  What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!"
"SpongeBob"," I think town's this way. "
"Squidward"," Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?"
"SpongeBob"," That's right.  Moss always points to civilization."
"Squidward"," That way? That way there?  So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?"
"SpongeBob","  Yep."
"Squidward"," Well, then I'm going this way. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think..."
"Squidward"," Trust me, I know where I'm going. "
"SpongeBob","  The Krusty Krab pizza absolutivally.  pizza...  pizza...  Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and  me!  Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. "
"Squidward"," Sponge, we gotta eat something."
"SpongeBob"," I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral.  No, maybe it wasn't coral.  Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud."
"Squidward"," Give me the pizza!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, I remember now. It was coral!"
"Squidward"," Give it to me!"
"SpongeBob"," No, we promised it's for the customer."
"Squidward","  You're right. It's for the customer."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay."
"SpongeBob"," Well?"
"Squidward"," Just a peek. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, it's fine."
"Squidward"," No, I think I saw something.  Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," What's that? Is that the cheese?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," And the pepperoni?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward","  Oh, looks good, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward.  I'm not letting you eat the pizza!"
"Squidward"," Give me the pizza!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Get away!"
"Squidward","  Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," Wait! "
"SpongeBob"," No! No! "
"Squidward"," I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!"
"SpongeBob"," Look, we're saved!"
"Squidward"," Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza, That's final!"
"SpongeBob"," No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! "
"Squidward"," Will you cut that out?!"
"SpongeBob","  Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!  Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!"
"Squidward"," That's just a stupid boulder!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not just a boulder.  It's a rock.  A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock.  Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive...  ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!"
"SpongeBob","  I can't wait to see the look on our customers face! "
"SpongeBob"," Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!"
"SpongeBob","  What drink?"
"SpongeBob","  But, you didn't order any..."
"SpongeBob"," But... but... "
"Squidward"," Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge?  Sponge? "
"Squidward","  Well, this one's on the house! "
"SpongeBob","  Did he change his mind?"
"Squidward","  He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite."
"SpongeBob","  No drink?"
"Squidward"," Nah. Now take me home. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. "
"Squidward"," Work?  Oh, my aching tentacles!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! "
"SpongeBob"," Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!"
"Squidward","  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Is it time already for you to ruin my day?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller...  Oh no!"
"Squidward"," Yep, it is. "
"Patrick","  Is it time already to ruin Squid's day?  Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. "
"Squidward"," What's going on here?"
"SpongeBob"," I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?"
"Squidward","  Yeah..."
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!"
"Squidward"," Well, what can I say?  It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else.   I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo! "
"Patrick"," Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. "
"Patrick"," No, wait a minute, no you don't.  We can build you a new house!"
"SpongeBob"," We can't build a house!"
"Patrick"," Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! "
"Patrick","  Ow! Ow! Ow! "
"Patrick","  We're done!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! So what do you think?"
"Patrick","  I wish I lived there."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," One bedroom. "
"Patrick"," Tartar sauce."
"SpongeBob","  Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop."
"Patrick"," Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!"
"SpongeBob"," That'd be great!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! We'll be rockmates!  Good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, rockmate."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...? "
"Patrick","  A spider! Spiders! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob! "
"Patrick"," Spiders! Spiders! "
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward? Squidward?"
"Squidward","  H-h-huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?"
"Squidward","  Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks. Thanks Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?"
"Squidward","  Uh oh yeah, sure. "
"SpongeBob"," While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?"
"Squidward","  Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy."
"Squidward","  Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I like sleepovers."
"Squidward","  Yeah. Me, too."
"SpongeBob"," Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Good night, SpongeBob.   Good night, SpongeBob.  Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late!  Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything!  I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you."
"Squidward"," Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob.  Please."
"SpongeBob"," Here come my parents. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mom."
"Squidward"," Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. "
"SpongeBob"," Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. "
"Squidward"," Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye.  Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. "
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving!  La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha!  He leaving, ha ha!  SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! "
"SpongeBob"," My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!"
"Squidward","  Forever?"
"SpongeBob","  Come, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot."
"Patrick","  Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man. I'm right behind you."
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," You know what this means."
"Patrick"," Donuts."
"SpongeBob"," By the power of Neptune. "
"SpongeBob"," Creatures of the deep, assemble!  Think... harder... Barnacle Boy.  Here they come. "
"SpongeBob"," Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful."
"Squidward","  What the? Ohh!"
"SpongeBob"," If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak."
"Patrick"," Jumping Jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!"
"SpongeBob"," Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave."
"Patrick"," Right, Mermaid Man."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!"
"SpongeBob","  Reflecto has found our secret lab."
"Patrick"," What would the real Mermaid Man do?"
"Squidward"," Why don't you go ask him yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," Elaborate, you vile fiend."
"Squidward"," He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, they must be working undercover."
"Squidward"," Yeah... now please leave me alone."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Can you believe it?"
"Patrick","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! "
"SpongeBob"," Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
"SpongeBob"," But you can't retire! There's evil afoot!"
"SpongeBob"," All I said that there was evil afoot."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
"Patrick"," It's too bad they're old."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience.  The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. "
"Patrick"," Ooh! Pretty lights!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mermaid Man."
"SpongeBob"," Hold on. Just let me look at ya."
"SpongeBob"," Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae.  And he globs onto the undersea dome.  And he starts sucking on the glass. "
"SpongeBob"," You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement."
"Patrick"," Did you re-unite our heroes?"
"SpongeBob"," No, but I'm married. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy."
"Patrick","  Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. "
"SpongeBob","  Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!"
"Patrick"," It's working."
"SpongeBob","  Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?"
"SpongeBob","  Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, Mermaid Man."
"SpongeBob"," This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. "
"Patrick"," Hehehehehe."
"Patrick"," It's the Raging Whirlpool. "
"SpongeBob"," Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Mission accomplished, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we did it. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow. That was even better than the old show."
"Patrick"," All thanks to you. ."
"Squidward"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?"
"Squidward"," Are you planning on ordering today, sir?"
"Squidward"," How original."
"Squidward"," Daring today, aren't we?  One Krabby Patty, extra onions. "
"SpongeBob"," One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! "
"Squidward"," Whatever.  Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! "
"SpongeBob","  Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! "

"Mr. Krabs"," Two bucks?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? "
"Mr. Krabs","  How about a discount on restroom tokens? "
"Mr. Krabs"," How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it!  No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs","  That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Wait! Wait! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!"

I can't remember how to do anything."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why don't you take the rest of the day off?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup...  The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!  Oh.  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain.  Uhh, which way do I live?  Of course.  No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun?

"SpongeBob"," Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or...  D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow.  Good-night, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, this isn't right.  Good-night, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary! "
"Squidward","  Patties are done. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Urrgh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why you talkin' funny, lad? "
"SpongeBob"," I anything can't do right since because pickles."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!"
"SpongeBob"," I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But you're fine, me boy!  Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not.  All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. "
"SpongeBob"," I how do that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's like riding a bike. You never forget!  Uhh... I'm gonna help ya!  If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Take your time. "
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no, no.  I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It is?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't talk like that!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works!  I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's time."
"SpongeBob"," I'm right here, Bubble Bass."
"SpongeBob"," This is where I belong!  ."
"SpongeBob"," Rawr."
"SpongeBob","  I didn't."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute!  Look!  He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And there's the pickles from last time too!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip..."
"Squidward"," Hooray."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip hip..."
"Squidward"," Whoop-de-doo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip hip..."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob"," And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone Squidward!  Hip hip..."
"SpongeBob"," Hip hip..."
"SpongeBob"," Hip hip..."
"SpongeBob"," Hip hip..."
"SpongeBob"," Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First I have to make my speech."
"SpongeBob"," Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  ""Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.""  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re... "
"SpongeBob"," I overdid the speech again, didn't I?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window. "
"SpongeBob"," The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick..."
"Patrick"," My ice cream! It's alive! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Down here!"
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick. Come down here. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm down here."
"Patrick"," Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," That's hall monitor to you!"
"Patrick"," Sorry, officer."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in."
"Patrick"," What crime?  I'm a bad person! "
"SpongeBob","  ""Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?"". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?"
"Patrick","  I wanna be good!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?"
"Patrick"," Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, now what?"
"Patrick"," Hmmm... "
"SpongeBob"," This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run em out! "
"Patrick"," Hello, brothers. "
"Patrick","  It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, uh huh."
"Patrick","  Horrible!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report."
"Patrick","  I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!"
"SpongeBob"," Get a hold of yourself, deputy."
"Patrick","  I wanna go home!"
"SpongeBob"," Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back."
"Patrick"," Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark."
"SpongeBob"," Just put on your siren and I'll be right there."
"Patrick"," Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.   Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!"
"SpongeBob","  Where is he, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  At the intersection of Conch and Coral. "
"SpongeBob"," That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?"
"Patrick"," Uhh, he's just standing there... MENACINGLY!  GET OUT OF THERE, SPONGEBOB!  THAT'S HIS MANIAC SHRIEK! HE'S GOING TO ATTACK!  He's acting all crazy! RUN! HIDE BEHIND THAT BUILDING!  NO, HE'S BEHIND THAT BUILDING! OH, QUICK, HIDE BEHIND THAT STREET SIGN!  NO WAIT! THE MANIAC JUST WENT BEHIND THAT SIGN! QUICK! GET UNDER THE STREET LIGHT!  NO WAIT, AGH, HE'S THERE TOO! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! "
"SpongeBob","  Say again, deputy?"
"Patrick"," THE MANIAC'S IN THE MAILBOX! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," Safety first.  A-ha! I finally gotcha!  Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later!  Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye!  I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home.  No. You can't go home with me.  Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey!  Stay!  Stay...   Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me!  Ahh, what the heck!  Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard!  Squidward! Look at my new pet!"
"Squidward"," That's no pet, that's a wild animal."
"SpongeBob"," No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch!  How many fingers am I holding up?  Play dead! "
"Squidward"," I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained!  I didn't need to see that."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun."
"Squidward"," How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish?  SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for twelve hours!"
"SpongeBob","  Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed.  Huh?  You got it all wrong, little fella.  Bed. Repeat after me.  Bed!  We'll just keep you right here."
"SpongeBob"," Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night everybody. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning Gary. Good morning jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh jellyfi-!  Where'd you all come from?  Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome.  This music is way too loud.  Very funny.  I'm serious! "
"Squidward"," Grr! Eighteen hours!  I'm going to give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears, I've had enough of this!  Strawberry.  Two can play at this! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on guys, enough is enough!  Huh?  Uh-oh! Hey, take it easy! Ow! OK, I'll talk to him!  Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it."
"Squidward"," The jellyfish don't like...?  Why sure, pal, I can play better."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, he said he'll play better.  Uh-oh! That's not better!  Hey! Take it easy with that!  Those are my things!  Don't break th- Dow! "
"Squidward","  Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down.  Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, now, that wasn't nice!  Okay, that is it! Everybody out!  Come on Gary!  Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in.  Huh? They stopped?  Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow! "
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?"
"SpongeBob"," What is it?"
"Sandy"," It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around."
"SpongeBob","  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?"
"Sandy","  I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," The moon! Can I go?"
"Sandy"," No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you."
"SpongeBob"," But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy."
"Sandy"," I need that drawer."
"SpongeBob"," Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. "
"SpongeBob"," Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!"
"Sandy"," That's the air vent, SpongeBob.  I need that, too."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?"
"Sandy"," All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just..."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!"
"Sandy","  But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?"
"Sandy"," Aww, hush, silly.  This is for harvesting moon rocks."
"SpongeBob"," Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting."
"Sandy"," Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naive? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave those crazy alien notions behind."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick."
"Patrick","  Hiya, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?"
"Patrick"," Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something."
"SpongeBob"," A present?"
"Patrick"," No. Uhh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?"
"SpongeBob"," There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy."
"Patrick","  Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!"
"SpongeBob"," Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! "
"Patrick"," Look how big it is, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," It's pretty impressive, all right."
"Patrick"," Come on! "
"SpongeBob"," We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Wow. How do you think we get inside? "
"SpongeBob"," We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows."
"Patrick"," I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Just don't touch anything. "
"Patrick"," Look, I'm winning!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?"
"Patrick"," Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?"
"Patrick"," I don't know!  But let's see what this does!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't think we should... "
"Patrick"," I like rockets. "
"Patrick"," More! More!"
"SpongeBob"," No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go."
"Patrick"," Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. "
"Patrick"," We've started the rocket!"
"Sandy","  Oh, SpongeBob... "
"Patrick"," Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!"
"SpongeBob"," Look!  We're in space now! Whee! "
"Patrick"," Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this! "
"Patrick"," Hey, who turned the heavy back on?"
"SpongeBob"," We must be landing."
"Patrick"," All right! "
"Sandy"," Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. "
"Patrick"," Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick."
"Patrick"," So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think..."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!"
"Patrick"," You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! "
"Patrick"," Alien hunting! Alien hunting!"
"SpongeBob"," Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uhh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to.  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. "
"Patrick"," Wait, what's that?  I think I'm gonna be sick."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you know what this thing is?"
"Patrick"," Stinky."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. "
"Patrick"," Pardon my French but get this thing off me! "
"Squidward"," Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!"
"Patrick"," It's awake!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's capture the little phony! "
"Squidward"," Get away from me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!"
"SpongeBob"," We don't want your money, moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there."
"Patrick"," Eww, gross."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there's plenty more where those came from. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip."
"SpongeBob"," There's no time for that! Just push harder. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... "
"SpongeBob"," Nice try, Sandy."
"Patrick"," Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. "
"Sandy"," Aliens? Is that what this is about?  This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- "
"SpongeBob"," It just goes to show you you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!"
"Patrick"," I didn't even know!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah? Well, I got you now."
"Patrick"," Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. It's from me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh... well, they might be."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But I got them for a bargain!  Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots.  So you want to get paid?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way."
"Mr. Krabs","  In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea."
"SpongeBob"," Who's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry."
"SpongeBob"," ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Paycheck! You got a deal--"
"SpongeBob"," And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You've got a deal."
"SpongeBob"," And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You got a..."
"SpongeBob"," And... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack!  You got yourself a deal."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!"
"Squidward"," That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music."
"Mr. Krabs","  Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty...  Wha? Who's there?  Back to countin' me money.  One, two, three, four, five...  What the barnacle is that?  Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. "
"Squidward"," That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now."
"Mr. Krabs","  What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?"
"Squidward"," I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots."
"SpongeBob"," Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh..."
"SpongeBob"," Or could he do this?  Or this?  And watch this, Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I, uhh..."
"SpongeBob"," And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. "
"Mr. Krabs","   I gotta go to my office!  I can still hear it!  It's still coming through! The infernal squeak!  Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Gary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it, my boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's okay, son."
"SpongeBob","  No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, it is!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! "
"SpongeBob","  They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Poor lad. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What'll ya have?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What did you say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants ."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Huh?  I didn't write that! "
"SpongeBob","  Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... "
"Mr. Krabs","  Stop it!  Stop... it!  Oh, oh, can't you hear it? Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboard!  Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots!  I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more!  The deed is done."
"SpongeBob"," Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook."
"SpongeBob"," You really think so, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl."
"Mr. Krabs"," Darling, I won't.  Oh, no. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob!  Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what do we do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here, use this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, come into me office.  What's wrong, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I."
"Mr. Krabs"," This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I've been thinking."
"Mr. Krabs"," We need to get you thinking about work. "
"SpongeBob"," No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. "
"SpongeBob"," And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. "
"Squidward"," And I thought this friendship would never pay off. "
"Patrick","  Are are are are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?"
"SpongeBob"," It's all yours. "
"Patrick"," A-a-and these old phone books?"
"SpongeBob"," All yours, old friend.  Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. "
"Patrick"," Ol' Reliable? "
"Sandy"," Howdy, y'all. Hey SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?"
"SpongeBob"," No Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Good-bye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz."
"Squidward"," He took off his pants."
"Sandy"," I'll give him a week. "
"Squidward"," I'll give him eleven minutes. "
"Patrick"," Patrick sad! "
"SpongeBob","  I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home!  Brothers and sisters, wait for me!  Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Ok, I'm here!  Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go  that way.  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  This is the life.  Hey everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz?  Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are?  Uhh... nice to meet you. "
"Sandy"," ""Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!""  There he is, Patrick. Say your line!"
"Patrick","  ""Why thank you, Sandy, I would love one. ""  ""Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. ""  I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm not coming home."
"Patrick"," I miss you!  Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm happy here. This is my home now. "
"Patrick"," No! SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this.  Patrick! What are you doing?"
"Patrick"," If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! I even picked out this nice jar for you! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! "
"Patrick"," I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! No! "
"Patrick"," Ok! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters.  Mmm, jelly.  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning.  Greetings, comrades!  Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! Ah!  Poison sea urchins!  Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches.  Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.  Krabby Patties.  Sandy.  What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. "
"SpongeBob"," You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't mind if I do. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning."
"SpongeBob","  Aye, aye, captain!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, do us all a favor. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't mind if I do.  Ta-da.  Aww."
"Squidward"," Ok, that's enough. "
"Squidward"," Can we please stop this? "
"Patrick"," Patrick itchy! "
"SpongeBob"," It is great to be home!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! So long Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do."
"Patrick"," Another year older. "
"Squidward"," It's not my birthday!  That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!"
"Squidward"," Oh that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible."
"Squidward"," Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say ""neighbors?"""
"Squidward"," Neighbors. Uhh..."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... "
"SpongeBob"," Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? "
"Squidward"," Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on SpongeBob, tackle me!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! You need bed rest!  I'll keep you safe until you're well again."
"Squidward"," Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Wednesday?"
"Squidward"," Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!"
"SpongeBob"," Does everybody know about Opposite Day?"
"Squidward"," Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, a game."
"Squidward"," Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?"
"SpongeBob"," Quiet and out of the way! Yay!"
"Squidward"," Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it."
"SpongeBob"," I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!"
"Squidward"," So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! It's Opposite Day and I...  ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day.  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, wheres your holiday spirit?"
"SpongeBob","  Company! I hate company. Who's there?"
"Patrick"," It's Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!"
"SpongeBob","  That's right! You're my worst enemy!  Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!"
"Patrick"," Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!"
"SpongeBob"," You have?"
"Patrick"," No! What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite."
"Patrick"," Oh! Let me try! Let me try! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Patrick, breathe!  Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!"
"SpongeBob","  Meow."
"Patrick","  Meow."
"SpongeBob"," Kcirtap yeh. "
"Patrick"," Pu evig i. "
"SpongeBob"," Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot. "
"SpongeBob"," Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?"
"Patrick"," Nope. "
"Squidward"," Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!  I'm almost sorry I'm leaving!  Opposite Day.  SpongeBob, what are you... "
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day...  ...terrible? "
"Squidward"," I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! "
"Squidward","  If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house! "
"Patrick"," Isn't it beautiful?"
"SpongeBob"," On Opposite Day it is. "
"Squidward"," Out of the way, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better.  Now you try."
"Patrick"," OK.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. "
"SpongeBob","  After you, Mr. Squidward."
"Patrick"," Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. "
"SpongeBob"," You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. "
"Squidward","  Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be ""Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!"" "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, please come in."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, everyone says that."
"SpongeBob","  Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft."
"SpongeBob"," Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?"
"SpongeBob"," Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery."
"Patrick"," Thank you! "
"SpongeBob"," I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," I'm Squidward, he's Squidward."
"Squidward"," Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," I hear you loud and clear. "
"Squidward","  Stop! Get away from her! Oh oh, I am so sorry, Ma'am, I hope these two  barnacle heads  haven't harmed you in any way."
"Squidward"," Why, I'm Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Ma'am, please! What about my house?!"
"Squidward"," Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't..."
"Patrick"," ...Go!"
"Squidward","  No, no, no, no, no!"
"Squidward"," Please, sell my house!"
"Squidward"," Don't leave me here! "
"Squidward"," Let me show you guys how much I... hate you! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?"
"Squidward","  Happy Opposite Day! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?!  Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Uh-uh... Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There's gonna be some changes around here.  A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab!  SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir!  Monsieur's change. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah!  Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?"
"SpongeBob"," I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. "
"Squidward"," That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money."
"Mr. Krabs"," The money? "
"Squidward"," And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights."
"Mr. Krabs","  Little Pearly... a star?"
"SpongeBob"," Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?"
"Squidward"," Going on what?"
"SpongeBob"," The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!"
"Squidward"," What talent could you possibly possess? "
"SpongeBob"," Ta-da! "
"Squidward"," No one, not even your parents, would want to see that.  What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!"
"Squidward"," I can hardly wait.  Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. "
"SpongeBob","  Wow! A full house!  There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! "
"SpongeBob"," I gotta get ready! "
"Squidward"," Alright people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop.  Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squid! How about this for the show?  The Amazing Mister Absorbency!  Ta-da!  Ta-da!"
"Squidward"," No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. "
"SpongeBob"," Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!"
"Squidward"," So you really want to be in the show?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes!"
"Squidward"," Ok, you get to mop up afterwards.  Now will you stop bugging me? "
"SpongeBob"," So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! "
"Squidward"," Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home.  Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well.  Put your fins together for...  Put your...  Put...  Pearl. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hooray! My little girl is finally a star."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's what I call talent! "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, listen, what do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. "
"Squidward"," And now, poetry.  By Gary. "
"Sandy"," He has such a way with words."
"Squidward","  Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?"
"Squidward"," Yes. "
"Plankton"," I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation...  ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes.  First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice try. Your act's over, bub. "
"Plankton"," You may win this time. She-hah-kazeek!  Well, this stinks. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!  This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!"
"Squidward"," Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see."
"Mr. Krabs"," For your sake, I hope you're right. "
"Squidward"," And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! "
"Squidward"," You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, can I go on now?"
"Squidward"," Yeah, show's over! "
"Squidward"," They want an encore!  Stand aside, SpongeBob! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You did it, Squidward! What a great show!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Down there, sir! "
"Plankton"," Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! "
"Squidward"," He got away, sir."
"Mr. Krabs","  No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!"
"SpongeBob"," A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tarter sauce! "
"SpongeBob"," Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true. "
"Plankton"," Argh! I can't take it!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! It's you!"
"Plankton"," Yes, and after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that...that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner."
"Plankton","  Wh-what did you say?"
"SpongeBob"," I said, you're a-- "
"Squidward"," How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!"
"SpongeBob","  I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie."
"Plankton"," A customer?  Our special today is chum...  ...balaya."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Plankton."
"Plankton"," Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?"
"SpongeBob"," No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me."
"Plankton"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Play with me."
"Plankton"," You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?"
"SpongeBob"," No, but I like to go jelly... "
"Plankton"," That naive cube! How long must I suffer this?"
"Plankton"," Elaborate. "
"Plankton"," Take the Krabby Patty? "
"SpongeBob","   ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields."
"Plankton"," Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game."
"SpongeBob"," Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net. "
"Plankton"," What happens after we eat 'em?"
"SpongeBob"," You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that."
"Plankton"," And?"
"SpongeBob"," And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!"
"Plankton"," Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!  I win, I wi--"
"SpongeBob"," It's not about winning, it's about fun!"
"Plankton"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a..."
"SpongeBob"," What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪"
"Plankton"," ♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪"
"Plankton"," Never! That's completely idiotic!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Here, let me help you, F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, try it!♪"
"Plankton"," ♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪"
"Plankton"," Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?"
"SpongeBob"," No! That's how you're suppose to feel!"
"Plankton"," Well, I like it. Let's do it again!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh, mutiny."
"Plankton"," And after that we frolicked through the flowers and then we..."
"Plankton"," Well, the really fun part was when we..."
"Plankton"," The what? "
"Plankton"," You can't rush these things, you know."
"Plankton"," What are you talking about?"
"Plankton"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming."
"SpongeBob"," Who knows? Maybe he's changed."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who knows? I think you knows! "
"SpongeBob"," He's changed, I tell you! "
"Plankton"," SpongeBuddy! Yoohoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Plankton-buddy! Lets go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you? "
"SpongeBob"," What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's..."
"SpongeBob"," Why cant you just accept our friendship?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here."
"Plankton"," Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh... suit yourself. "
"SpongeBob"," We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on Plankton, let's get out of here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hold on there laddie, I'm a-comin! "
"SpongeBob"," I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey Bubble Bass! "
"Plankton"," Thanks for that, friend."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy! "
"SpongeBob","  I cant believe this!"
"Plankton"," It's not what you think."
"SpongeBob"," What is it then? What do you see here?!"
"Plankton"," I... I don't see anything."
"SpongeBob","  How can you not see it!? "
"Plankton","  Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it!"
"SpongeBob"," But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?"
"Plankton"," How long what?"
"SpongeBob","  How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!"
"SpongeBob","  What?!"
"Plankton","  All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!"
"SpongeBob","  Really? "
"Plankton"," No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, maybe on a discount. "
"Plankton"," "
"SpongeBob"," It's time to grow myself large and wide. "
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. "
"Sandy"," Well, you're smelly."
"SpongeBob"," All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. "
"Sandy"," Uhh, I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob but you won't see any progress with those."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, really?"
"Sandy"," That is, if you want arms like these.  Or these!  Or these! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help."
"Sandy"," Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, really? That'd be great Sandy! I can see me now.  Yeah... that would change everything!"
"Sandy"," Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet.  Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! "
"SpongeBob"," One. "
"Sandy","  Alright, put 'em up!"
"SpongeBob","  They're up."
"Sandy"," Ding ding!  Feeling the burn?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! "
"Sandy"," Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher."
"SpongeBob"," Arm-cruncher, great.  This squirrel's trying to kill me!"
"Sandy","  This is it."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye.  This working-out thing isn't working out.  Ow. Ow. Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, now that's a good idea!"
"SpongeBob"," I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone!  Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mother of pearl! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, guys. "
"SpongeBob","  Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait...  They're big aren't they?"
"SpongeBob","  Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second.  Yeah. Anyone up for the...  ...juice bar?"
"Sandy"," Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?"
"Sandy"," Uhh, whatever. Thanks."
"SpongeBob"," I start off with 20 raw eggs everyday. But that's just me."
"Sandy"," Pardon me."
"SpongeBob"," Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. "
"SpongeBob"," I remember when I used to look like you, too.  But, that was a long time ago."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you.  Yeah..."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?"
"SpongeBob"," I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results.  Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better."
"Sandy"," Heck, what's your secret?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Sandy"," Your secret workout. What is it? "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, well... I, uhh... first I take my hand and I do this... "
"SpongeBob"," Do these muscles lie? "
"Sandy"," I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me."
"Sandy"," Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, what do you mean?"
"Sandy"," The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!"
"Sandy"," Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, well, I'm not sure."
"Sandy"," C'mon, let's go."
"SpongeBob"," Now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a...  Sandy, wait!"
"Sandy"," Here it is-- the sign-in list."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no."
"Sandy","  Ok, Sandy Cheeks. "
"SpongeBob","  Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet!"
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," Wait!"
"Sandy"," Ok..."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob SquarePants. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, wait...! "
"Sandy"," It's ok, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," Ready, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. "
"Sandy"," Beat that, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Just kidding. Just kidding. "
"Sandy"," That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk! "
"SpongeBob"," 96. 97. 98. 99. 100."
"Sandy"," I want 100 more."
"SpongeBob"," It hurts.  1. 2. 3. 4..."
"Sandy"," I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," ...9. 10.  Can you get that?"
"Squidward","  Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided.  There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! "
"SpongeBob"," Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!"
"Patrick"," G-7? King me! King me!  I lose!"
"SpongeBob"," But it's not Tuesday, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Tartar sauce! "
"Squidward"," Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?"
"Squidward"," Hey Patrick, do you know what time it is?"
"Patrick"," Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... "
"Squidward"," Time to find some other game to play! "
"SpongeBob"," Now what?"
"Patrick","  We could toss that shell back and forth."
"SpongeBob","  Okay... ready! "
"Patrick"," Go! "
"SpongeBob"," I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember Patrick, finders keepers."
"Patrick"," There it is! "
"Patrick"," Bonus points! "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious."
"Patrick"," Don't worry. I know how to do this. "
"SpongeBob"," Get off him, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," What are you worried about?  He looks better already. "
"SpongeBob"," But he still feels cold. "
"Patrick"," Well, let's go put him in the warm."
"SpongeBob"," Do you think he'll be okay?"
"Patrick"," You know, you worry too much.  The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe...  ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know."
"Patrick"," It kind of looks like... "
"SpongeBob"," No, no, that part goes here."
"Patrick"," Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," We're almost there. We can do this."
"Patrick"," It's working, it's working..."
"SpongeBob"," This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!"
"Patrick"," Look! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I thought he was dead. "
"Squidward","  What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?"
"SpongeBob"," No, stay back!"
"Squidward"," What is the matter with you two?"
"Patrick"," Don't, don't hurt us!"
"SpongeBob"," It was an accident!"
"Squidward"," What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll..."
"SpongeBob"," Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger! "
"Patrick"," Oh yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!"
"SpongeBob"," We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! "
"Squidward"," Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand."
"SpongeBob"," Does that include..."
"Squidward"," Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!"
"Patrick","  I think they make a cream for that now. "
"SpongeBob"," Here?"
"Squidward"," Too hot. "
"SpongeBob"," Here?"
"Squidward"," No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. "
"SpongeBob"," Here?"
"Squidward"," Toulouse-Lautrec. "
"SpongeBob"," Too tired... "
"Squidward"," Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment."
"SpongeBob"," Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. "
"Patrick"," One watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness. "
"SpongeBob"," Art thou not pleased? "
"SpongeBob"," Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it."
"Squidward"," Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?"
"Patrick"," I found it. "
"Squidward"," Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak."
"SpongeBob"," Flank steak."
"Squidward"," I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this! "
"SpongeBob"," But this is just a piece of tissue paper."
"Squidward"," Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't do it! "
"Squidward"," Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room."
"Patrick","  I found it. "
"Squidward"," I'll take that! "
"Patrick"," Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you ready for this?"
"Patrick"," Yes. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? "
"Patrick"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's this way."
"Patrick"," Where?"
"SpongeBob"," Here."
"Patrick","  Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?"
"SpongeBob"," It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! "
"Patrick","  Oh look, you missed some. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," We're going to go shopping?"
"SpongeBob"," No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. "
"Squidward"," Ow, what the heck was that?"
"SpongeBob"," Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony."
"Squidward"," Ceremony for what?"
"SpongeBob"," We're going to put you to rest."
"Squidward"," I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," Well, I'm going to go check. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, get in."
"Squidward"," Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing."
"SpongeBob"," But you said we could put you to rest."
"Squidward"," I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!"
"SpongeBob"," I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi Squidward. Does this look deep enough?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Cut that out!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?"
"SpongeBob"," No, just into this hole. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. "
"SpongeBob"," You're bald?"
"SpongeBob"," But-"
"Squidward"," Do it!"
"SpongeBob"," Go home.  But Master--"
"Squidward"," I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors. "
"SpongeBob"," As you wish, master."
"Squidward"," D'oh!"
"Patrick"," Boy, he really had us fooled."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever."
"Patrick"," You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, say that again."
"Patrick"," That again?"
"SpongeBob"," No, the other thing."
"Patrick"," No, the other thing."
"SpongeBob","  No, what you said before when you..."
"Patrick"," No, what you said before when you.."
"SpongeBob"," Never mind. I've got an idea."
"Patrick"," Never mind! I've got an idea. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't reach him!"
"Patrick"," Blow harder.  There he goes!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't he beautiful?"
"Patrick"," How high's he going to go? "
"SpongeBob"," All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend."
"Patrick"," Happy trails! "
"SpongeBob"," He's on the other side now."
"Patrick"," Yeah.  He's in a better place. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now she can't seem to find another."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take you!  Well, what about Squidward? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now listen boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it?  I made this part out of..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!"
"SpongeBob"," Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert!  Oh Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom."
"SpongeBob"," No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?"
"SpongeBob"," What is it Gary? What do you have?  Hey Gary, this magazine gives me an idea!  Long.  Tan.  Handsome. Okay Gary, wait till Pearl gets an eyeful of this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello?  What do you think Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook! "
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh-uh...  first prom picture. "
"SpongeBob"," Be right there."
"SpongeBob"," Just a second.  Cheese!  That'll be a keeper."
"SpongeBob"," Prom expert; away! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!"
"SpongeBob"," What is it? "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! "
"SpongeBob","  That just didn't happen. Let's go!  Ready? "
"SpongeBob"," The Whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet!  Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. Whatever you do, don't... "
"SpongeBob","  — Messed everything up."
"SpongeBob","  — Hot dog."
"SpongeBob","  All I wanted was to have a good time."
"SpongeBob","  Can I still wear the wig?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's go!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned."
"Mr. Krabs"," A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower!  You almost stepped on it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job, laddie. "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! ."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward."
"Squidward"," All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you know what today is?"
"Squidward"," Annoy Squidward Day?"
"SpongeBob","  No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money."
"SpongeBob"," That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder."
"Squidward"," Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. "
"SpongeBob"," No!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! "
"Squidward","  Need some help?  What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Making...Krabby Patties?"
"Squidward"," You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of...  ...garbage."
"SpongeBob","  Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!"
"Squidward"," I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!"
"SpongeBob"," That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of..."
"Squidward","  It's a symbol that you're a chump! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award! "
"SpongeBob"," An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat."
"Squidward"," I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! "
"SpongeBob"," What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! "
"SpongeBob"," But, sir…"
"SpongeBob"," Crystal, sir!"
"SpongeBob"," I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? What are you doing here? "
"SpongeBob"," You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! "
"Squidward"," Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!"
"SpongeBob"," That can be arranged."
"Squidward"," You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row."
"Squidward"," Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!"
"SpongeBob"," I've been better than you 26 months and it'll be 27 tomorrow."
"Squidward"," Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm going to show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm going to be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!"
"Squidward"," Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!"
"Squidward"," I don't need to sleep! Loser!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me."
"Squidward"," I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, getting sleepy huh?"
"Squidward"," No, how about you?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope!  Nighty Night. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?"
"Squidward"," I'm going to wring you dry when I get out of here! Now get me out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward! "
"Squidward"," That oughta hold him! "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! Why you little…! "
"SpongeBob"," Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!"
"Squidward"," So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce? "
"SpongeBob"," Truce."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. "
"Squidward"," Ok, let's have a good clean fight."
"SpongeBob"," And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!"
"Squidward","  Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him."
"SpongeBob","  As soon as he stops shaking my hand..."
"Squidward","  ...I'm gonna make a run for it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait! "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!"
"Squidward"," Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on here?! "
"SpongeBob"," It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No!"
"Squidward"," Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!"
"Squidward"," There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double you output, Sponge-Hog!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys, boys, boys!  Help! Help! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait, wait, wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties!"
"SpongeBob"," So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?"
"Squidward"," Me, me! It's me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Who's there? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?"
"SpongeBob"," No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, the worst monster of them all."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?"
"Mr. Krabs"," True as the deep blue."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, maybe just a little."
"Mr. Krabs"," Have a seat, me boy.  Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this.  Only bigger!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Like I was saying, The Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls. "
"SpongeBob"," Do souls look like pickles?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag. "
"Squidward"," I've come for your pickle! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year! "
"SpongeBob"," Humph, Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants! "
"Squidward","  Steal your soul. "
"SpongeBob"," The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'm sick of it.  No more ScaredyPants! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr! "
"Patrick"," Hiya, SpongeBob!  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
"SpongeBob"," Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?"
"Patrick"," Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume. "
"SpongeBob"," What do you think?"
"Patrick"," Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!"
"SpongeBob"," No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!"
"Patrick"," Uhh... something's missing. I know!  Step into these babies, Hans.  Terrifying."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know Patrick. "
"Patrick"," Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare! "
"SpongeBob","  Rawr-rawr! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay, here's your candy."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Patrick."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost!  Oooh, scary."
"SpongeBob"," That is it, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What's it?"
"SpongeBob"," What's the difference between that ghost and me? "
"Patrick"," No, no, no wait. Don't tell me.  D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me."
"SpongeBob"," I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary! "
"Patrick"," Okay, are you ready?"
"SpongeBob","  Remember, like this. "
"Patrick"," Are you sure you want to do this?"
"SpongeBob"," Shave me down, make me round! "
"Patrick"," All right, let's get to it. "
"SpongeBob"," What do you think?"
"Patrick"," Perfect. Now that's scary!  Let's go scare somebody. "
"SpongeBob"," Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!"
"Patrick"," Oooh... I don't know who I am! "
"SpongeBob"," Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!"
"Patrick"," Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend! "
"Patrick"," Oh boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch."
"SpongeBob"," Do you think?"
"Patrick"," Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!"
"SpongeBob"," Who should we scare next?"
"Patrick"," There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited!  Here comes someone now! "
"SpongeBob"," Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman! "
"Sandy"," Howdy Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?"
"Squidward"," What are you supposed to be?"
"Sandy"," Why, I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl!"
"Squidward"," I don't get it. "
"Patrick"," Are you ready, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, kill the lights!"
"Patrick"," Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls!"
"Patrick"," Huh? "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob","  Help! Help!"
"Patrick","  I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's the real Flying Dutchman! "
"SpongeBob"," Do you mean I'm not scary?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what do you know? I scared him!  It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat."
"SpongeBob"," Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain."
"Patrick"," Oh. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, it grows back!"
"SpongeBob","  Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch! "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?   Good job Gary!  I love you, Gary!  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!  Ha, ha! Down boy! Ha ha! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?"
"SpongeBob"," For what?"
"Patrick"," The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend!  So, you ready or what?"
"SpongeBob"," That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary! "
"Squidward"," Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?"
"Squidward"," What's a Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Not a Gary...Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello! "
"Squidward"," Yuck. You actually care for that thing?"
"SpongeBob"," I love Gary!"
"Squidward"," Well, I don't. Get somebody else. "
"SpongeBob"," I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. "
"Squidward"," Go away?  You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, a three day weekend."
"Squidward"," As in, not here for three days?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand."
"Patrick"," Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!"
"Squidward"," I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away."
"SpongeBob"," You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk... "
"Squidward"," Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend."
"SpongeBob"," Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night."
"Squidward"," Sure it's enough? "
"Patrick"," The bus is here! The bus is here!  C'mon, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward","  Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye."
"SpongeBob"," Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?"
"Squidward"," I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred."
"SpongeBob"," Gary."
"Squidward"," Right, yeah, right.  Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone! "
"Squidward","  This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail! I forgot the snail!  I've got to do something.  Okay, okay ,okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.   Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!"
"SpongeBob"," See you later, Patrick."
"Squidward"," Come on, eat! Eat! Eat!  Ohh..."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! I'm home!"
"Squidward","  Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! What are you doing here? "
"Squidward"," Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you."
"SpongeBob"," What a great friend you are, Squidward."
"Squidward"," So, uhh, well, see you. Good-bye."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Squidward.  I can always count on you.  Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I knew it! Oh Squid, did you hear that?"
"SpongeBob"," Aren't you going to do it?"
"Squidward"," Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there."
"SpongeBob"," Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too."
"Squidward"," Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!"
"Squidward"," Okay, okay, I'll do it. "
"SpongeBob"," Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady.  Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. "
"Squidward"," Will you hold him still? "
"SpongeBob"," Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma."
"Squidward"," Well, you made me do it."
"SpongeBob"," What's going to happen to me?"
"Squidward"," Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, I feel kind of funny!"
"Squidward"," I'm telling you, its all in your head. "
"Squidward"," He just needed water?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, you're better! "
"Squidward"," Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!"
"Squidward"," Trust me SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. "

"SpongeBob"," Here ya go. Eat up, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I-I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! "
"SpongeBob"," 'Gary, you're getting a  lot faster! "
"SpongeBob","  Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! "
"SpongeBob","  Gary... I'm fine! "

"SpongeBob"," Meow!  Meow. Meow.  Meow!  Meow. Meow. "
"Squidward"," None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! "
"Squidward"," Uh-oh! "

"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over! "
"Squidward"," I wonder who that could be. "
"SpongeBob"," Ready to go?"
"Squidward"," No, I'm not ready to go! "
"Patrick"," He doesn't wanna play with us."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," How about now?"
"Squidward"," No!  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," How about now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"Squidward"," No!  No!  What?!"
"SpongeBob"," Ready yet?"
"Squidward"," No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure we do."
"Squidward"," What?  D'oh...! "
"SpongeBob"," Ready? "
"Squidward"," Out! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. "
"Squidward"," Hold on a second. I'll be right out.  Hello...?  Ahh, alone at last. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!"
"Squidward"," A-ha! They're finally gone!  What the...?  Locked?! Oh no! Oh, well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time."
"Squidward","  I'll be out of here in no time."
"Squidward"," Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?"
"Squidward"," What?"
"Squidward"," Uh, the future...  Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?"
"Squidward"," Wha...?  Oh, my...  Impossible! He's lying!  He's right!"
"Squidward"," Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?"
"Squidward"," Future! Future! Future! Future!  Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!"
"Squidward"," J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!"
"Squidward"," Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior...  Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! "
"Squidward","  Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm.  Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet.  Huh?  Huh? What?!  Huh!?  SpongeBob?  Stay back!  Uh, no thanks.  Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now.  Yes, that's my arm.  Oh, that's sweet.  What, is it time for your flea bath now?  Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish.  Well, I'm going away now.  Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!"
"Squidward"," What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them!  Give me those loincloths!  I can't believe it.  This oughta make things go a little smoother!  Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this!  It's called jellyfishing.  Ah, finally.  Get me outta here!  Uh-oh. "
"Squidward"," He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all...  ...aloooone! "
"Squidward"," I gotta get outta of here!  Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?!  I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Patrick!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys."
"SpongeBob"," Does this mean you wanna go..."
"Squidward"," No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?"
"Squidward"," I'm going back."
"SpongeBob","  Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else.  Ah, what a great day at work.  Huh? Yeah...  I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge...  ...Bob.  I got you now! Hi-yah!  Well, I guess the coast is clear."
"SpongeBob"," I love this show! "
"Sandy"," Me too! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi-yah!  Uhh, just a second.  Safety first!  And now, spin technique! "
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! Yah. "
"SpongeBob"," Double overhand squirrel knot! "
"Sandy"," I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," That'll be the day. "
"Sandy"," Hello?  Nice try, SpongeBrain!  Yah!  Heh, silly me. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?"
"Sandy"," I don't think so."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it goes like this!  Oh wait, I forgot the punch line.  Oh, yeah!  That's a good one, isn't it?  What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful...  pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. "
"Sandy"," No it's not, SpongeBob.  This is!  Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping!  Mmmm, my favorite."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours."
"Sandy"," I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yah."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Curses! "
"Squidward"," Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah. Gotcha! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," What? "
"Squidward"," I'm going to pretend that didn't happen.  Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! "
"SpongeBob"," Order up. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and. Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all."
"SpongeBob"," Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!  Ssss!  Took care of her, yes I did.  Oh, ahoy, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What was that?"
"SpongeBob"," But sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!"
"SpongeBob"," Hah!  Sandy! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No more."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. "
"SpongeBob","  Fired?  No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate."
"Sandy","  Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop."
"Sandy","  I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," No, really! Please, stop! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the?  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What did I just get through telling ye, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," But I uhh, she..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're fired!"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Fired? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?  Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's it's mine! He tried to tell me but I wouldn't listen!  Give him another chance, please?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm.  Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind.  Mmm, mammals. "
"Sandy"," Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing.  Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about  this?"
"SpongeBob","  Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!"
"Sandy"," We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun."
"SpongeBob"," We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?"
"Sandy"," Almost some."
"SpongeBob"," I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis."
"Sandy"," Wanna go to the park? "
"SpongeBob"," Karate sure is dumb."
"Sandy"," Yeah, you can say that again."
"SpongeBob"," I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!"
"Sandy"," You like what?"
"SpongeBob"," Not karate."
"Sandy"," Ha! I don't even know what that is."
"SpongeBob"," Me too. I don't know what anything is! In fact..."
"SpongeBob","  For a second that sounded like."
"Sandy"," Karate?"
"SpongeBob"," Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?"
"Sandy"," Karate."
"SpongeBob"," What did you say?"
"Sandy"," Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich.  There we go. "
"SpongeBob"," How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?"
"Sandy"," One. Just one."
"SpongeBob"," One for you! "
"Sandy"," Hmmm?"
"SpongeBob"," And one for me! "
"Sandy"," Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?"
"Sandy"," Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Sandy"," Do you think, umm do you think I could cut this one?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, sure."
"Sandy"," Thanks. Hi-yah!  Is that enough?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe just one more. Or two!"
"Sandy"," Or three!"
"SpongeBob"," Or 10!"
"Sandy"," 10! Yes, 10! Because we're really hungry!"
"SpongeBob"," Right!"
"Sandy"," Right!"
"SpongeBob"," Right!"
"Sandy"," Right! "
"SpongeBob"," Time for buns! "
"Sandy"," How about some tomatoes?"
"SpongeBob"," And I'll cut the cheese! "
"Sandy"," And, what else should we slice? "
"SpongeBob"," More buns!"
"Sandy","  And lettuce!"
"SpongeBob"," Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy?  Right? I guess I'll eat one now. "
"Sandy"," You're mince meat!"
"SpongeBob","  In your dreams! Hi-yah! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? What the barnacle? "
"SpongeBob"," Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?"
"Mr. Krabs","   Bleuhahugh!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs!  Uhh, hey Mr. Krabs, hows it going?  Nice day, huh?  Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fire you?  I've got something else in mind. "
"Sandy"," I love karate!"
"SpongeBob"," I love kara-tay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I love money-ay! "
"Squidward"," I hate all of you."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, time for bed, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary.  You know what they say curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!"
"SpongeBob"," No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?"
"SpongeBob","  This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? "
"SpongeBob"," Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary! You can talk!"
"SpongeBob"," What does that mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Who?"
"SpongeBob","  Gee Gary, you sure are smart."
"SpongeBob"," Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. "
"SpongeBob","  I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want."
"Patrick"," Yup."
"SpongeBob"," I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?"
"Patrick"," Yup. "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. "
"Patrick"," Okay. Bye SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!"
"Squidward","  Sponge-  Bob..."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!  Huh? Huh?"
"Squidward","  No way."
"Squidward","  Please SpongeBob, no tricks."
"SpongeBob"," Trust me, Squidward. "
"SpongeBob","  La la! La la la la la la la! "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward","  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! "
"SpongeBob","  So long, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... "
"Sandy","  Hey SpongeBob, what brings you here?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy! What's going on?"
"Sandy","  Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. "
"SpongeBob"," This seems kind of dangerous!"
"Sandy"," Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay! "
"Sandy"," Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! "
"SpongeBob"," Gotcha! "
"Sandy"," Not a Parakeet! Para-  medic..."
"SpongeBob","  Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Pearl. This is your dream."
"SpongeBob"," Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream."
"SpongeBob"," Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. "
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha doin Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," What are you talking about?"
"SpongeBob","  Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!"
"SpongeBob","  This one?"
"SpongeBob","  Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  Net ready, sir!"
"SpongeBob"," Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.  "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Hey! I...!"
"SpongeBob"," This'll make a great fish story, eh Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom."
"Plankton"," Zap!  I see you.  Zap! "
"Plankton"," I see you. Zap!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! "
"Plankton"," I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!"
"SpongeBob"," This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!"
"SpongeBob","  Gary! Gary! No!"
"Plankton"," Here kitty, kitty, kitty."
"SpongeBob"," Gary!  I've got you, Gary!"
"Plankton"," Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!"
"SpongeBob","  I think he's got the point. "
"Plankton","  Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face! "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah... "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?"
"Squidward"," No. We are not having a slumber party!"
"Sandy"," Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!"
"Plankton"," Take a hike!"
"Squidward"," Don't we get enough of you during the day?"
"Patrick","  Does anyone have a quarter? "
"SpongeBob","  Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself."
"SpongeBob"," Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds."
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't get the suds,  because then I'd have to miss work! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm not sick. I'm going to work. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties? "
"SpongeBob","  Right away, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse. "
"Mr. Krabs"," The suds?"
"SpongeBob","  Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work."
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs, I'm ok, honest. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, now go home and get some rest.  Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food!  No, wait! Wait! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand. "
"Sandy","  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?"
"Sandy"," Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in..."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, ok, Sandy, thanks.  Coming. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor."
"Patrick"," What? Oh, you can't go!"
"SpongeBob"," Why not, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!"
"SpongeBob","  It can't be as horrible as the suds. "
"Patrick"," Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well first, they make you sit in the waiting room."
"SpongeBob"," Is that the horrible part, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines!  Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope."
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Patrick"," Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it...  Ssssss! "
"SpongeBob"," No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor."
"Patrick"," Exactly. "
"SpongeBob"," You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," What else are friends for?  It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick.  Voilà!  Feel better?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. "
"Patrick"," Help, I'm shrinking!  No! Please don't hurt me!"
"SpongeBob"," No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!"
"Patrick"," You think so?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!"
"Patrick"," And they said I'd never make anything out of myself."
"SpongeBob","  My fingers are too big for the buttons. Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? "
"Patrick"," Sure, patient SpongeBob.  Hello, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Hiya, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob."
"Sandy"," I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital."
"Patrick"," Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today."
"Sandy"," Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot..."
"Patrick"," Oh yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy!  Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor!  Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please.  Feeling better?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh. "
"Patrick"," Feeling better yet?"
"SpongeBob","  Not really."
"Patrick","  How...about...now?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't...think so. "
"Patrick"," Feeling better?"
"SpongeBob"," No. "
"Patrick"," How about now?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope. "
"Patrick"," How about now?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh. "
"Sandy"," Hello, SpongeBob?"
"Patrick","  Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home."
"Sandy"," Patrick, you open this door.  Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you.  Hey!  Ok, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep."
"Sandy"," Ok, now tell me,  since when do you have two houses?"
"Patrick"," Since I ran out of space to put my stuff."
"Sandy"," Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet? "
"Patrick"," This is my mobile home. "
"SpongeBob"," Hiya, Sandy."
"Patrick","  Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine."
"Sandy"," Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor."
"Patrick"," No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh... "
"Sandy"," See? He's even worse than I thought."
"Patrick","  What do you mean? He's fine. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm ok, Sandy, really. "
"Sandy"," I'm taking you to the doctor right now. "
"Patrick"," Hey, that's my patient!  You can't take him to the doctor's."
"Sandy","  Don't be silly, Patrick!"
"Patrick","  He's mine! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you'll be better soon. "
"Patrick"," I'll save you! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm better, guys! Really! "
"Sandy"," Now look what you've done, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up."
"Sandy"," You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!"
"Patrick"," I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Guys!"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't stop now!  Help me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Shiny dimes."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?  Stop! SpongeBob! Stop!  Ooh. "
"SpongeBob","  You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! 's back in the shower] This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!"
"Patrick"," A lollipop?  Hey, doc, I have the suds, too."
"Patrick","  Hey! Hey, wait!  Ouch! That hurts!  Wait, this doesn't seem right!"
"SpongeBob","  Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! "
"Sandy"," Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob. I'm nuts for you. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. "
"Sandy","  Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him.  Take me through the plan again."
"SpongeBob"," Ok.  Step one  Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival.  Step two I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel.  Step three You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact.  Step four Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished.  Hi Patrick."
"Patrick","  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Oh my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock!  Hold on buddy, I'll get you out!  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm right behind you! "
"Patrick"," There you are.  Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present."
"SpongeBob"," And I have a present for you!"
"Patrick"," You do?"
"SpongeBob"," It's the greatest...  ...the bestest...  ...the most fantabulous...  ...present ever!  But you can't have it yet. "
"Patrick"," Huh? Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Because it's not ready yet."
"Patrick"," Is it ready now?"
"SpongeBob"," Not yet."
"Patrick"," How about now?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you want to ruin the surprise?"
"Patrick"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!"
"Patrick"," Oh, come on, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm...nope, sorry."
"Patrick","  You gotta tell me!"
"SpongeBob"," No can do!  You'll just have to wait! "
"Patrick"," Please. Oh please...  ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, here we are"
"Patrick","  You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine.  Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not the carnival."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob","  Here, why don't you take this quarter and..."
"Patrick","  Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not the quarter."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Now take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... "
"Patrick"," Cotton candy! I can't believe it!  Cotton candy!"
"Sandy"," Sandy to SpongeBob.  Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Ten-four Sandy, SpongeBob here. "
"Sandy","  I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is."
"Sandy","  You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob...  Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!"
"Patrick"," So if it's not cotton candy then what is it? I can't take it!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll have to guess!"
"Patrick","  This tent?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick","  This guy?"
"SpongeBob"," No. "
"Patrick"," This paramecium?"
"SpongeBob","  Nope."
"Patrick","  Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'.  It wasn't there either!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure?  SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. "
"Sandy"," Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!"
"SpongeBob"," Late? But what about...  ...Patrick?"
"Sandy"," Hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out!"
"SpongeBob","  If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... "
"Patrick","  I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris..."
"Patrick"," Ferris wheel!  I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Well this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal.  SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! "
"Sandy"," Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere!  Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B!"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, B, Sandy! No, B!  Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?"
"Patrick"," No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, here it is! "
"Patrick"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," It's a handshake...a friendly handshake."
"Patrick"," A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?"
"SpongeBob"," A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! "
"Patrick"," I've been thinking. At first a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts… "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, no problem Fran. "
"Patrick"," And even though I was expecting more... "
"SpongeBob"," You too, Dave. "
"Patrick"," And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long... "
"Patrick"," So as I was saying..."
"Patrick","   Patrick needs love, too!  I defy you, Heartman! "
"Patrick"," Heart on stick must die!  Heart on stick must die! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Huaaagh!"
"Patrick"," Give me SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this.  But, do they?"
"Patrick"," They didn't get me anything either!  Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you! "
"Sandy"," Yee-haw! Get along little shellfish! Gallop you scallops! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! "
"Patrick","  Sure it is."
"SpongeBob"," I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around!"
"Patrick"," Uh-uh."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, just turn around! "
"Patrick"," You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?"
"Patrick"," No."
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!"
"Sandy"," Howdy, Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Hi Sandy! "
"SpongeBob"," Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! "
"Patrick"," Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything."
"Squidward","  Ah, time to relax. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Well, time to go. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Squidward, wait!"
"Squidward"," Now what?"
"SpongeBob"," You dropped this little piece of paper."
"Squidward"," Yeah, so what?"
"SpongeBob"," I just figured you probably want it back."
"Squidward"," What's the big deal? It's only garbage?"
"SpongeBob"," Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of..."
"Squidward"," ...garbage. "
"SpongeBob"," So you don't want it?"
"Squidward"," Right! "
"SpongeBob"," Does that mean I can have it?"
"Squidward"," Yes, by all means, take it.  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," You sure?"
"Squidward"," Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever! "
"SpongeBob"," So are you definitely, positively sure?"
"Squidward"," Get out!"
"SpongeBob"," But are you..."
"Squidward"," Get out! "
"SpongeBob"," Last chance to change your mind, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!"
"SpongeBob"," So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob...  What in the world are you giggling about?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just...  ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper! "
"Squidward"," How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper?  Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?! "
"SpongeBob"," La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this!  Guess what I am."
"SpongeBob"," Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also...  Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape. "
"Squidward"," Super-moron's more like it."
"SpongeBob"," Now I'm...  SpongeBob JunglePants! "
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Ugh. SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends. "
"SpongeBob"," You're right Gary. I'm not a jungle boy. I'm a box of army supplies.  Bringing relief to the hungry troops!  Landing just in time for the bullfight!  Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro...  Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache.  Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I am not a pirate."
"Squidward"," Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper.  How did he do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Look, Gary, oral-gami. "
"Squidward"," Hey, that little paper does seem like fun.  What am I saying?! I am such an idiot.  SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun?  Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun.  Erosion.  Mitosis.  See, I can have fun taking a bath.  Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything.  I'll prove to him that paper is not fun!  I'm having fun, la-la-la..."
"SpongeBob","  Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la...  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
"Squidward"," Hey, SpongeBob, top this one.  Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?"
"Squidward"," What? Why you... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try.  Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?"
"SpongeBob"," La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
"Squidward","  Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this? "
"SpongeBob"," Nope. "
"Squidward"," Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper! "
"SpongeBob","  Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original."
"Squidward"," What? I didn't play any wrong notes. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself.  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go... "
"SpongeBob"," I can't!"
"Squidward"," What do you mean you can't? "
"SpongeBob"," I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever."
"Squidward"," I never said anything like that!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure you did, Squidward, look. "
"Squidward","  Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!"
"SpongeBob"," Wanna see it again?"
"Squidward"," No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise.  Maybe I should get going."
"Squidward"," Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm..."
"Squidward"," Not the lint, the rubber band!"
"SpongeBob"," The rubber band? Do I dare?"
"Squidward"," Oh, dare, dare!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay...  Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise."
"Squidward"," Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? "
"Squidward"," Trade... "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, listen... "
"Squidward"," Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise."
"Squidward"," Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, cause this is all I'll need?"
"Squidward"," You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!"
"Squidward","  Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a..."
"Patrick","  ...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob. "
"Squidward","  Does anybody have any sunscreen?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!"
"SpongeBob"," Yippee! I'm rich! Look Patrick, eight gold doubloons!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this? Where are the doubloons?"
"SpongeBob","  There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game ""The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt""."
"Patrick"," Based on a real treasure map."
"SpongeBob"," Take a break and play around with us."
"Patrick"," Yeah! C'mon sweaty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Have you finished cleaning the tables?"
"SpongeBob"," I cleaned the tables Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?"
"SpongeBob","  I already took care of it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me."
"Patrick"," My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick, you're fired!"
"Patrick"," But I don't even work here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Would you like a job, starting now? "
"Patrick"," Boy, would I?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You're fired!"
"SpongeBob"," My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone."
"Mr. Krabs","  Shiver me timbers!"
"SpongeBob","  Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh, fish eyes. One, two."
"SpongeBob","  You are a real pirate. Go straight to the ""X"" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Can't you see we're closed?!  Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row."
"SpongeBob"," I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you can't walk out on me now."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there? "
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, it is late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you gotta... "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's awful lad. If the Dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll roll for ya boy."
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Eight paces, now that's a good start lad."
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr..."
"Mr. Krabs"," One, two, three..."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avas! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates."
"SpongeBob"," Pirates?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ay, ay, ay. Relay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, don't you feel more like pirates?"
"SpongeBob","  Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! "
"Patrick","  I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. "
"SpongeBob"," Ow."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark."
"SpongeBob"," Really? Can we see the map?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map."
"SpongeBob"," Okie dokie, then."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, ""okie dokie, then."" A pirate says, ""arrgh!"""
"SpongeBob"," Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Out with it man, arrgh!"
"Patrick"," I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land..."
"Mr. Krabs"," ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?"
"SpongeBob"," The whole ship is underwater captain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way captain?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ensign Patrick, which way is east?"
"Patrick"," Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the ""X""? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east."
"Patrick"," Ooh! East? I thought you said ""weast""!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?"
"Patrick"," This one, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. 9,551... 9,552..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, we're tired."
"Patrick"," And hungry."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand! "
"Patrick"," Don't cry, Captain Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll stay with me then?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent."
"Patrick"," I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks."
"SpongeBob"," But we've only been gone a few hours."
"Patrick"," I know. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!"
"SpongeBob"," He's not here."
"Patrick"," Look! The treasure map."
"SpongeBob"," Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Yeah..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," Nothing."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're not suppose to look at the map. "
"Patrick"," I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that is there?"
"SpongeBob"," No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Patrick"," Did you notice something familiar about this map?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Do you think this is a problem?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sneaking peeks at me treasure?"
"Patrick"," We're sorry."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?"
"SpongeBob"," Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!"
"Patrick"," I think that."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!"
"SpongeBob","  Look! It's the ""X""."
"Mr. Krabs","  ""X"" marks the spot!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
"SpongeBob"," We got it Captain Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha, ha. Hand it up to me lads. Heave! "
"Mr. Krabs"," We finally found it. "
"SpongeBob"," What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!"
"SpongeBob"," We found it together. So we deserve a share!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!"
"SpongeBob"," What about loyalty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"SpongeBob"," And one for all."
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"SpongeBob"," And one for all."
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"SpongeBob"," And one for all."
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"SpongeBob"," And one for all."
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"Mr. Krabs","  They did!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! I'm captain of this crew. Where's my reward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest."
"Patrick"," Gee Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again."
"SpongeBob","  Another funtastic day at Glove World! "
"SpongeBob"," Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...  Patrick, do you have any change?"
"Patrick"," How much do you need?"
"SpongeBob"," How much is it?"
"SpongeBob","  Fifty cents."
"Patrick"," Nope."
"SpongeBob","  Lemme check my other poc-"
"SpongeBob","  What did you say?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, mister."
"Patrick"," Show me what you got at Glove World!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok! Here's my glove light. "
"Patrick"," Wow..."
"SpongeBob","  I see you! "
"Patrick"," I got gloves for my glove action-figure! "
"SpongeBob"," Cool! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?"
"SpongeBob"," Where did you see that?"
"Patrick"," We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'."
"SpongeBob","  What? "
"Patrick"," What's wrong SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think we're on the wrong  ...bus!  But sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick"," What is this, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Rock Bottom.  It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. "
"Patrick"," Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know.  Maybe we should wait for one more. "
"Patrick"," I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, uhh, ok. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule.  Boy, this place sure is creepy. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here.  SpongeBob...! "
"SpongeBob"," I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus.  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle.  I better go wait for the next one.  C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary.  Uh-oh, shoe's untied.  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over...  and through the hole.  My balloon!  Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus. Aww, not again!  Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me?  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I...  No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes...  Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what.  I'm gettin' hungry.  Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!.  Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that?  A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch.  I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what!  I'll only be gone a second.  Hey!  Ooh!!  Come on, come on!  Hey, that was mine!  Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy.  Tartar sauce!!  Fish paste!  I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise!  Ok, second. I am second in line.  Ok, third is good.  Fourth, not bad.  Ok, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, at least the line is moving.  Tartar sauce!! "
"SpongeBob"," Finally! Yes, I'm next!  When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?"
"SpongeBob"," The bus schedule. The next bus."
"SpongeBob"," The next bus...  to bikini...  Bottom. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh,  no...  you don't. "
"SpongeBob"," Hold it, I'm not through here!  Do you hear me?  I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then I am not leaving this spot.  Ok, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light!  Ah, that's better."
"SpongeBob"," This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is...advanced darkness. Hey...  if I close my eyes it doesn't seem so dark."
"SpongeBob"," Who's there?  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking.  Running! Better start running! Running!  Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting!  Sitting, sitting. Bleeding.  Hey, who's there?  Ok, that's enough.  Don't come closer.  I'm warning you!  I'm a sponge!  Oh, it's only you.  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem.  I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon...  has...  enough...  air...  thanks.  Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank...  you! "
"SpongeBob","  Ah, home at last. "
"Patrick","  Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!"
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home."
"Patrick"," Hiya SpongeBob!  Whatcha doin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place."
"Sandy"," Don't lose your barnacles boys. Hi-yah!  There it is!"
"SpongeBob"," What is it?"
"Sandy"," Can't you see? It's Texas."
"SpongeBob"," Texas? What's a Texas? "
"Sandy"," Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now."
"SpongeBob"," All right then. Let's make one of your tree dome."
"Sandy"," You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy? Hi-yah!"
"Sandy"," Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now."
"SpongeBob"," Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up Sandy!"
"Sandy"," No, thanks. "
"SpongeBob","  Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! "
"SpongeBob"," Look Sandy, we caught one!"
"Sandy"," Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish."
"SpongeBob","  We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!"
"Patrick"," Fly away, little critter!"
"SpongeBob"," Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember there's no place like home!  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?"
"Sandy"," I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy..."
"Sandy","  Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick."
"SpongeBob"," Homesick, huh?  Almost there."
"Sandy"," Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Da-ta-dah. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Go away. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?"
"Patrick"," Maybe it's just a squirrel thing.. "
"Sandy"," ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪  ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick do you hear that? "
"Patrick"," Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy."
"Sandy"," ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪  ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my 20 acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪  ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪  ♪I wanna go home.♪ "
"Patrick"," Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas."
"Patrick"," Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!"
"Patrick","  Where?"
"SpongeBob"," Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, hurry up lads! We can't squat like this forever!"
"Patrick"," Wait until she sees the..."
"SpongeBob"," Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! "
"SpongeBob"," You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?"
"Sandy","  Hey SpongeBob. Hey Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing with those bags?"
"Sandy"," I'm going back home to Texas."
"SpongeBob"," What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we..."
"Sandy"," It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home."
"SpongeBob"," Wait Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?"
"Sandy"," I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," But, Sandy, don't you want to say good-bye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?"
"Sandy","  I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad."
"SpongeBob"," No, no! Wait! Sandy!  I can't believe she's gone."
"Patrick"," Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? "
"Sandy"," What did you say?"
"Patrick"," Texas is dumb?"
"Sandy"," Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?"
"Sandy"," No, you can't!"
"Patrick"," Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?"
"Sandy"," No! You can't say nothing about Texas!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about...  Texas!"
"Sandy","  I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Look Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!"
"Patrick"," I'm Texas too! Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!"
"SpongeBob"," Howdy y'all!"
"Patrick"," Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!"
"Sandy"," Y'all best cut it out!"
"SpongeBob","  The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas!  Hey, Patrick, what am I now?"
"Patrick"," Uhh, stupid?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm Texas!"
"Patrick"," What's the difference?! "
"Sandy","  Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll have to catch us first!  We did it! We got her!"
"Patrick"," Krusty Krab, here we come!  Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, that's enough."
"Patrick"," Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... "
"SpongeBob"," Run faster, Patrick! "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! "
"Sandy"," Hi-yah!  Y'all gonna take back what ya said!"
"SpongeBob"," No! Almost there! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, no! "
"Sandy"," Wha-what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," It's a party!"
"Patrick","  For you!"
"Sandy"," For me?!"
"SpongeBob"," It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out Sandy! We got square dancing...  ...giant Barbecues... "
"Squidward"," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
"SpongeBob"," ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie...  ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats!  So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags."
"Sandy","  I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. "
"Sandy"," Huh, duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it."
"SpongeBob"," Does that mean you'll stay?"
"Sandy"," I'm staying! "
"SpongeBob"," That makes me feel all wiggly."
"Patrick"," Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? "
"Sandy"," What did you just say?!"
"Patrick"," Should I start running now?"
"Plankton","  Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the  'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.' "
"Plankton","  Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--"
"Plankton","  You'll see.  You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer!  I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need...  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!"
"Plankton"," Yes. He's the one. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll have one... "
"SpongeBob"," One, please. "
"SpongeBob"," One please."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?"
"Plankton"," Oh, hi, SpongeBob.  I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one!  I don't know what to do with the other one! "
"SpongeBob"," I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya."
"Plankton"," SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! "
"Plankton"," SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah? "
"Plankton"," Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training. "
"SpongeBob"," Training?"
"Plankton"," Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how."
"SpongeBob"," Assertive, huh?"
"Plankton"," That's right."
"SpongeBob"," Anything I want.  Sounds great! "
"Plankton"," Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1 tell him to get off!"
"SpongeBob"," Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face."
"Plankton"," No, no, be assertive! "
"SpongeBob"," Beep Beep! "
"Plankton"," Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!"
"SpongeBob"," But I'm a spo..."
"Plankton"," Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?"
"SpongeBob"," Ice cream! "
"Plankton"," Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! "
"Plankton"," Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!"
"SpongeBob"," That's my ice cream cone!"
"Plankton"," Great! Now let him have it!"
"SpongeBob","  You can have it."
"Plankton"," No!  I'll show ya how!  Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you, slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that guy was crying!"
"Plankton"," Those were tears of joy I told you! He was happy that you were assertive!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Plankton"," You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I thought it was called assertive."
"Plankton"," Whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if it got me this ice cream, I like it!  I found something!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!"
"SpongeBob","  Do you want to take a hike with me?"
"Plankton","  Now look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, go check in that ditch! "
"SpongeBob"," Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?"
"Plankton","  Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time."
"SpongeBob"," No it's not!"
"Plankton"," Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy."
"SpongeBob"," But what about airline food?"
"Plankton"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? "
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!"
"Plankton"," Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?"
"SpongeBob"," Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!"
"Plankton"," Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, not all of me."
"Plankton"," Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll do better than that! "
"Plankton"," SpongeBob that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Plankton"," Breaking your wind! "
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!"
"Plankton"," Exactly."
"SpongeBob"," You didn't tell me everyone would leave."
"Plankton"," Oops. "
"SpongeBob","  Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development!  That wasn't nice!"
"Plankton"," Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, what about aggressively nice people?"
"Plankton"," Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting! "
"SpongeBob"," What happened? "
"SpongeBob"," No problem! "
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket."
"Plankton"," Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!  Need hatred. "
"SpongeBob"," Volleyball, anyone?  Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!"
"SpongeBob"," Wake up, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," We're moving today!"
"SpongeBob"," That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! "
"SpongeBob","  No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!"
"SpongeBob","  Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst! "
"SpongeBob","  Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me! "
"Squidward"," What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible."
"Mr. Krabs","  What'd you catch?"
"Squidward"," I caught sight of the calendar."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month."
"Squidward"," I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You just missed him."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but he told us to tell you..."
"Squidward"," Tell me what?"
"SpongeBob","  He told me to tell you... April Fools."
"Squidward","  Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait!"
"Squidward"," Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!"
"Squidward"," You do?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward"," Well, as long as it's not me."
"SpongeBob"," They're right here, lady! "
"SpongeBob"," April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, what's that?"
"SpongeBob"," April Fools! I'm right here!"
"Squidward"," What are you doing behind the counter?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go."
"SpongeBob","  April Fools! "
"SpongeBob"," I...  I... "
"SpongeBob"," You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools! "
"Squidward"," That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Something for me to clean up! "
"Squidward"," April Fools! "
"SpongeBob"," Whooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... "
"SpongeBob"," Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! "
"Squidward","  I'll catch you, SpongeBob!  Whoops.  April Fools, you little sausage!  SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?"
"Squidward"," Wait, don't go!"
"Squidward"," Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.   SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?"
"Patrick"," Digging."
"Squidward"," Why are you wearing that hat?"
"Patrick"," Hmm, I don't know. "
"Squidward","  Where's SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," He's in the house. He's impressed."
"Squidward"," With what?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! "
"SpongeBob"," What do you want?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. "
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't, I don't have a bottle opener. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go."
"SpongeBob"," But I couldn't... "
"Squidward"," I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! "
"Patrick"," It mus've been pretty good to make him cry like that. "
"Squidward"," Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Is all that true?"
"Squidward"," Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true."
"SpongeBob"," Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?"
"Squidward"," What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody."
"SpongeBob"," I promise."
"Squidward"," Really? "
"Squidward","  April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! "
"SpongeBob"," What would we do without Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! "
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease but all have failed."
"SpongeBob"," Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready! "
"Patrick"," Uhh!"
"SpongeBob"," Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh."
"Patrick"," Rude. Hey, the light changed."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick..."
"Patrick","  Hold on, almost there. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants."
"SpongeBob"," But, but..."
"SpongeBob"," Like?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, I've got two. "
"Patrick","  He is the new royal fry cook and you..."
"Patrick"," Is it hot in here or what? "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!"
"Patrick","   Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch."
"Patrick","  Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob? "
"Patrick"," Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges! "
"Patrick"," He'll settle for one."
"SpongeBob"," I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!"
"SpongeBob"," How you feeling?"
"Patrick"," Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?"
"Patrick"," Hey, that sounds pretty good."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands."
"SpongeBob","  May the best man win."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge."
"Patrick"," Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me ""Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds."" Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger! "
"SpongeBob","  Once upon a time..."
"SpongeBob"," Perfect!"
"SpongeBob"," So, uhh, what do you think?"
"SpongeBob"," What's so funny?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean, Patrick can't come?"
"SpongeBob"," And my friends?"
"Patrick","  It was nice knowing you, buddy!"
"SpongeBob","  I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you too."
"Mr. Krabs"," I lost me bet!"
"SpongeBob"," I... I...  I don't wanna go!"
"SpongeBob","  Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! "
"Patrick"," Good morning, Krusty Krew."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?"
"SpongeBob"," What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?"
"SpongeBob"," Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. "
"Mr. Krabs"," They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes!  The hooks! The hooks!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The hooks! The hooks!"
"Squidward","  You don't know how lucky you are."
"Mr. Krabs"," The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business..."
"Squidward"," I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya."
"SpongeBob"," Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks."
"SpongeBob"," The hooks?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye.  The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher   until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse..."
"SpongeBob","  What could be worse than that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gift shops. "
"SpongeBob","  Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. "
"Patrick","  Good morning, Krusty Krew."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go."
"SpongeBob"," I can't leave now. I'm working."
"Patrick"," It's not leaving. You're just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!"
"SpongeBob"," Where is everybody?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier."
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!"
"Patrick","  Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!"
"SpongeBob"," All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!"
"Patrick"," Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it."
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs said..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, don't!"
"Patrick"," Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive."
"Patrick"," Am I ever. You should try it."
"SpongeBob"," But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?"
"Patrick"," You just jump off before you go up too high."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things."
"Patrick"," Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, no."
"Patrick"," Wheeee."
"SpongeBob"," I guess he didn't. "
"Patrick"," Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! "
"SpongeBob"," Ready?"
"Patrick"," Ready."
"SpongeBob"," This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. "
"Squidward"," Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?"
"Squidward"," It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?"
"Squidward"," He took a break."
"Mr. Krabs","  Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues.  Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget."
"Squidward"," But Mr. Krabs, I still need help! "
"Mr. Krabs","  They should be right here. "
"Patrick"," Again?"
"SpongeBob"," Again!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The hooks! No! No! No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone!  If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!"
"SpongeBob"," I...I...I..."
"Patrick"," I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down."
"Mr. Krabs"," And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?"
"SpongeBob"," Gift shop?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again."
"Mr. Krabs"," I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. "
"SpongeBob"," I always go to work this way."
"Patrick"," You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick, we promised."
"Patrick"," Well, I had my fingers crossed."
"SpongeBob"," You don't have any fingers, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs said..."
"Patrick"," Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm..."
"Patrick"," See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun.  Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Psst, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm...no.  I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep."
"SpongeBob"," What am I gonna do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There's only one thing to do, boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls.  Doh, ok. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh...lad?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise.  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!  Whew. "
"Squidward","  Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. "
"SpongeBob"," The pants! The underwear! "
"Patrick","  Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready! I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw. I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea!"
"SpongeBob","  Whahoo!  Oh, I wonder when my  prize will...  get here...  My prize!  Can it be? It is.  The Conch Signal.  From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  As seen on TV.  I wonder if it still works."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm.  Maybe the Conch Signal doesn't work anymore."
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, I'm..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that was me. I blew the Conch Signal, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry. There's no danger."
"SpongeBob"," I won it in a contest."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sirs!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies."
"SpongeBob"," Help... Can't...  open mayonnaise."
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey,  can I drive?"
"SpongeBob"," Tons. Like the windshield wipers are right here. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!"
"SpongeBob"," You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder."
"SpongeBob"," But you said he could snap...  ...just like that."
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob","  It doesn't seem to be here."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked.  But I can't let my heroes down. "
"SpongeBob","  I found it and it's the special dance mix!"
"SpongeBob"," Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph? "
"SpongeBob"," I am?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh..."
"SpongeBob"," Gary!  Uh, uh, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary.  Come in!"
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet."
"Patrick"," Uh...  Wouldn't you rather see them on...  My hands?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay...  And we can wear gloves on our feet  and hats on our captain's quarters, too. "
"Patrick"," Uh, actually... I have a confession to make.  I don't know how to tie my shoelaces."
"SpongeBob","  Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?"
"Patrick"," Yes. "
"SpongeBob"," Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?"
"Patrick"," Gosh... Probably not."
"SpongeBob"," I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there  and let an old pro show you how to do it.  Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start  by taking one lace per hand...  And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the..."
"Patrick"," Are you sure you know how to do it?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?"
"Patrick","  Your shoes are still untied. "
"SpongeBob","  Well,  I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it."
"Patrick"," I'm sorry!  I won't interrupt anymore!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin.  That's... ""knot"" right.  Get it? Knot... right... hmm..."
"Patrick"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, no more fooling around.  I've got it! "
"Patrick"," What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, aren't you late for something?"
"Patrick"," Oh, poop deck, You're right!  We'll have to do this lesson   later! Bye SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember.  Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep.  Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later.  'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read...  ...y!  I'm read...  ...Ooh!  I'm read...  ... Uh!  I'm read...  ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh! "
"Patrick"," Oh, hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes. "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest.  Well, I've gotta get to work.  Oh, barnacles! maybe I should just lay here."
"Squidward","  Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties!  Laces or no laces!  Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot.  Ta-da! A perfect patty."
"Squidward"," Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it?"
"Squidward","  Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties and do the dishes and wear square pants and live in a pineapple while you wait in the unemployment line!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward"," Then bring that patty here now!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, Squidward. Here I come. I'm coming over.  I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now. "
"Squidward"," Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward.  Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the...  Dah!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll just make another... Doh! "
"Squidward"," Sponge... "
"SpongeBob"," Hold it... Doy!  Let me just...  Doy! "
"Squidward","  I think my heart just stopped.  It's Sponge...  ...Bob's fault! "
"SpongeBob","  I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula.  I'm sorry, hat.  I'm sorry, floor.  I am sorry, Krabby Patties. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's see, a five-letter word for happiness. ""Money."" "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Wait! Don't go! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," It's SpongeBob's fault. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, get out here!  More.  More.  All the way, boy!  What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," I... I... I... I... I... I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes, yes?"
"SpongeBob"," I... I... I... I... I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Out with it, boy!  What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," I forgot how to tie my shoes."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's all?"
"SpongeBob"," So you'll show me how?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't wear shoes. "
"SpongeBob"," Could you show me how to tie my shoes?"
"SpongeBob"," Could you show me how to tie my shoes?"
"SpongeBob","  Could any of you show me how to tie my laces?  Could you, you, you, you, or you show me how to tie a knot?  Could you show me how to tie a simple knot?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?"
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't anybody know how to tie a knot?! "
"SpongeBob","  I did."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, please, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Hooray! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh..."
"SpongeBob","  Those are great, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Now can you show me how to tie my shoes?"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not in the mood, Gary."
"SpongeBob","  Just leave me and me untied shoes alone, Gary  Okay, Gary, you have my attention."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! Well, I'll be! You can tie shoes!  Hoppin' clams! How did you learn to do that? "
"Squidward"," Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol.  No one ever comes in on Sunday.  Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home?  SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell! "
"SpongeBob"," I was just testing it. "
"Squidward"," I will ring the bell when there's an order. But...  ...there's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any! "
"SpongeBob"," One Krabby Patty coming up!"
"Squidward"," No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That sounds like me money dropping.  What's going on out here?! My babies!  Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled!  I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up.  Clear the way!  No, no, no, don't cry, little ones."
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong, Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Me dime!   No!  I got it, boy.  What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," You've gotta let go of the dime."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave!  Me arms!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, not again! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait.  Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone."
"Squidward","  You can count on me, sir!  Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts.  Takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion."
"SpongeBob","  Ahh! Really?"
"Squidward"," You get to run the cash register."
"SpongeBob"," The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?"
"Squidward"," You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing two hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah... This is the best day of my life."
"Squidward"," Me, too."
"SpongeBob"," But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?"
"Squidward"," I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. "
"Squidward"," You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe this is really happening.  Today, I start living! "
"Squidward"," Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face. "
"Squidward","  I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh!  Sponge...  ...Bob. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?"
"Squidward"," No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar. "
"SpongeBob"," Do you want four quarters?  Or ten dimes?  Or twenty nickels?  Or one hundred pennies?  Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies?  Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are..."
"Squidward"," Alright, goodbye.  This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation.  I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah..."
"Squidward","  Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored.  SpongeBob, bored. "
"Squidward"," Oh, what am I doing?  I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. "
"SpongeBob"," May I help you, sir?"
"Squidward","  It's me, you dunce!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Squidward!  How are those errands going?"
"Squidward"," What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm sure you are."
"Squidward"," I don't like your tone."
"SpongeBob","  I'm sure you are.  How's that?"
"Squidward"," Just do your jobs! "
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles.  Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. "
"Squidward"," Must... re...  ...lax!  Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow. Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me. You will not go back to the Krusty Krab. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Have you finished...?"
"Squidward"," No!  That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant! "
"SpongeBob"," Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?"
"Squidward"," No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me!  I know what you're up to.  Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!"
"SpongeBob"," But I haven't..."
"Squidward"," Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! "
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear  these hats. "
"Squidward"," There!  Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself!  I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care.  Just gonna... Relax.  Let Squid's day off... begin.   What was that?  It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me, to see if I'm really doing errands.  But, but he left his post.  And I've finally caught him messing up.  Aha! I caught you, Sponge...  ... Branch.  Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.  I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a...  ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say..."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet? "
"Squidward"," Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab!  I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob! "
"Squidward","  The truth will be revealed!"
"Patrick","  Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks, Doc. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  Aha! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom!  And then you were in my bathtub, and  I... And-and you... And I... And then you... Swam... Down the drain and... Beat me... to the Krusty... Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, does that mean you're...? "
"Squidward"," Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do. "
"SpongeBob","  Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open"". . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?"
"SpongeBob","  That's right!  A sundae!  Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup!  Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring.  Ah, here we go! Onions!  Ready, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Just one more thing! Pea...  ...nuts. Gary!  Our peanuts jar is totally empty!  Hmmm...  Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts.  Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill.  A little texture never hurt. There we go.  This sundae's gonna taste great!  Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me!  You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Okay, let's see my to-do list.  Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work.. wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday.  Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'.  Hello.  Some people are even late on Sunday.  Hi, mailfish!  Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! A parade! Hi, parade!  Hi tuba player, hi drummer, hi guy with the cymbals, hi trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi timbale man, hi didgeridoo player,  hi triangle player, hi guy with the kettle drum, hi pianist, hi guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly! "
"SpongeBob"," Was it something I said?  Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now...  ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next? "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused."
"Patrick"," Yes, I am."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch.  Hi, building!  I just don't get it."
"Patrick"," I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed. "
"Patrick"," Maybe it's your voice. "
"SpongeBob"," Good one, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly."
"SpongeBob"," Ugly?  You gotta be kiddin' me.."
"Patrick"," Better try the reflection test. "
"SpongeBob","  Hi. "
"Patrick"," Ugly."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly!  Am I ugly?  Am I ugly? "
"SpongeBob"," Oof I'm ugly... "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?  SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am. "
"Patrick"," Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up.  It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.'  Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end. "
"SpongeBob"," That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you. "
"SpongeBob"," Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over."
"Patrick"," Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on buddy I'll help you.  Okay now, say it.  Say it."
"SpongeBob"," I can't."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest. "
"SpongeBob"," I know, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," Say it. Say it."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ugly."
"Patrick"," You're ugly and what...?"
"SpongeBob"," Square?"
"Patrick"," No. Proud."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ugly and I'm proud."
"Patrick"," Good! Say it louder."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ugly and I'm proud."
"Patrick"," Louder."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ugly and I'm proud."
"Patrick"," Louder!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ugly and I'm proud!  I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!"
"Squidward"," Is that what he calls it? "
"SpongeBob"," That felt great! I feel empowered."
"Patrick"," So whaddya wanna do now?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly Sponge coming through. "
"Patrick"," People respect self esteem. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you."
"Patrick","  Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide. "
"Patrick","  What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello."
"Patrick"," You look at it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi."
"Patrick","  Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!"
"SpongeBob"," They all ran away, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered.  I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!"
"Patrick"," That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-"
"Patrick"," I just want some-"
"Patrick"," My hands aren't that dirty...  Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?"
"Patrick","  Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Wouldn't you like to know?"
"SpongeBob"," And why is that bag on your head?"
"Patrick"," Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!"
"SpongeBob"," Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride."
"Patrick"," That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick...?"
"Patrick"," What's my mom gonna say?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but... "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. "
"Patrick"," Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief..."
"SpongeBob","  Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!"
"Patrick"," Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
"SpongeBob"," No, I mean just this morning."
"Patrick"," Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
"SpongeBob"," What else?"
"Patrick"," Well, I had some of your sundae."
"SpongeBob"," Sundae...  Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!"
"Patrick"," Whatcha mean? "
"SpongeBob"," I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!"
"Patrick"," Stink? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, guess what, Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make."
"SpongeBob"," Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulas!"
"Squidward","  How disappointing."
"Mr. Krabs"," You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thar she blows! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?"
"SpongeBob"," No new spatulas?"
"Squidward"," No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Right! "
"Squidward"," So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions."
"SpongeBob"," Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!"
"Mr. Krabs","  All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, pole. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me! "
"SpongeBob"," What's in the box?"
"SpongeBob"," I like surprises."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready! "
"Squidward"," Well, I like it so far."
"Squidward"," Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!"
"Squidward"," Fish paste."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! "
"Squidward"," Well, I didn't think it was possible SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual."
"Squidward"," Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for."
"Squidward","  Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation."
"SpongeBob"," A stick in the sand."
"SpongeBob"," Me? Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. "
"Squidward","  For what, dare I ask?"
"Squidward"," Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?"
"SpongeBob","  The King Krab?"
"SpongeBob","  The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, too scary. "
"Squidward"," That's it! I quit! "
"SpongeBob"," Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," Well, hip people have to eat too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot but my grill is hotter. "
"SpongeBob"," Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads."
"SpongeBob"," But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato."
"SpongeBob"," All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties  happenin.'  Oh yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw."
"SpongeBob","  Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh... right on."
"SpongeBob","  Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob"," This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on in, me boy! Have a seat."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?"
"SpongeBob","  Sure Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news."
"Mr. Krabs"," How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh you're right SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?"
"SpongeBob"," There there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it boy!"
"SpongeBob"," What's it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You could fire her! It's ok if she hates you."
"SpongeBob"," That's not what I said, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great then, it's all settled you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. "
"SpongeBob"," Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?"
"SpongeBob","  How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. "
"SpongeBob"," Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!"
"SpongeBob","  I got it! I can pretend to  ""fire you."" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later."
"SpongeBob","  Stop trying to break me in half?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl I need to have a word with you! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen."
"SpongeBob"," It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Pearl, you're fired. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh Pearly...  Is that a 20?  Oh SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? "
"SpongeBob"," There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," She's off to bigger and better things."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I going to get my money back for all this stuff? "
"SpongeBob","  Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!"
"Patrick"," An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award.  Jellyfish, I got an award.  Island, I got an awar...  I gotta show SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Hold still, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Almost done. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award."
"SpongeBob"," That's great, Patrick. What's it for?"
"Patrick"," See for yourself."
"SpongeBob","  ""For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement SpongeBob SquarePants?"""
"Patrick"," SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake."
"Patrick"," But, it's shiny. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?"
"Patrick"," Ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," Exactly!"
"Patrick"," I can find it. Is it in here?"
"SpongeBob"," No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet."
"Patrick"," I want an award. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note."
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey Squidward! Want to play?"
"Squidward","  No."
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure?"
"Squidward","  Yes."
"SpongeBob"," Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy! """" Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on! "
"Squidward"," Please come again. When I'm not working. Next."
"SpongeBob"," Hi Squidward!"
"Squidward"," How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!"
"Squidward"," This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm not hungry."
"Squidward"," Well, thanks for stopping by."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!"
"Squidward"," Why would I do that?"
"SpongeBob"," He's hungry."
"Squidward"," He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds."
"Squidward"," I'm not taking an order for a bubble."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit. "
"Squidward"," May I take your order?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. "
"Mr. Krabs"," One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. "
"SpongeBob"," Bubble Buddy's thirsty."
"Squidward"," How about a glass of our finest shampoo? "
"SpongeBob"," Sounds great! "
"Squidward"," Here's your hair care product, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Think of the customer."
"Squidward","  Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!"
"Squidward"," And?"
"SpongeBob"," Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?"
"Squidward"," We? How about you take these patties and sh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch."
"Squidward"," What, is he allergic to bread, too?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward..."
"Squidward"," Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask."
"SpongeBob"," That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So long, boys! You see Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day."
"Squidward"," Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this?"
"Squidward"," Bubble money.  At least they left a tip! "
"SpongeBob"," Here we are Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. "
"SpongeBob"," See what I mean?  All done!"
"SpongeBob"," Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy."
"SpongeBob","  My friend's in there."
"SpongeBob","  Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Bubble Buddy, you're finished! "
"Mr. Krabs","  He owes me money!"
"Squidward","  He made me provide excellent service!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I say we tip something over! "
"Squidward"," Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?"
"SpongeBob","  Hey everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?"
"SpongeBob"," Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern."
"SpongeBob","  Why?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!"
"SpongeBob"," No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never..."
"Squidward"," Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!"
"SpongeBob"," No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!"
"SpongeBob"," So, what do you say?"
"Squidward"," Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!"
"SpongeBob"," Noo... "
"SpongeBob"," So long. "
"Squidward"," He's... alive?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast. "
"Squidward","  Uh...hi?"
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?"
"Squidward"," To go home?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for you."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah. "
"Squidward"," ""I ♥ you..."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. "
"SpongeBob"," I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?"
"Squidward","  It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? "
"SpongeBob"," Eyelashes! "
"Squidward"," Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," After you present your brotherhood gift."
"Squidward"," I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift."
"Squidward","  The only thing I'm making is for the exit. "
"SpongeBob"," Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice."
"Squidward"," Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?"
"Squidward"," Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good."
"Squidward"," Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. "
"Squidward"," So, what flavor is it?"
"Squidward"," Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?"
"Squidward"," But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  ""To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."""
"Squidward"," And that's what happened."
"Mr. Krabs"," 25 dollars? A bomb?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's where you left it."
"Squidward"," It's not there."
"SpongeBob"," Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?"
"Squidward"," Kill him? "
"SpongeBob"," Here's your order, sir."
"Squidward"," No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!"
"Squidward"," You've seen this before?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eleven times as a matter of fact. "
"Squidward"," Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. "
"Squidward","  You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Note to self Watch out for Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes?"
"Squidward"," I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift."
"SpongeBob"," Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two... "
"Squidward"," Please, don't do that."
"SpongeBob"," What's the part two?"
"Squidward"," Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? "
"SpongeBob"," Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list."
"Squidward"," Great. Uh, let me see it. "
"SpongeBob"," The things that are extra fun, I've written in red."
"Squidward"," Everything's in red."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I know."
"Squidward"," We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation."
"SpongeBob"," Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you."
"Squidward"," Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list."
"SpongeBob"," Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over."
"SpongeBob"," Good, cause we're onto our next activity."
"Squidward"," Which is...?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit."
"Squidward"," You're going to be wearing a salmon suit?"
"SpongeBob","  That's a good one Squidward.  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock."
"Squidward"," Who's there?"
"SpongeBob"," I am! "
"Squidward","  Oh, yeah... "
"SpongeBob","  Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! "
"SpongeBob"," Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face."
"Squidward","   I can't breathe. "
"Squidward"," Are you sure you should be poking it like that?"
"SpongeBob"," Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is..."
"Squidward","  Does it involve more dismemberment?"
"SpongeBob"," Watch the sunset with Squidward."
"Squidward"," Sunset? "
"Mr. Krabs"," The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later."
"Squidward"," C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us."
"Squidward"," Yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," Explosions... I mean, erosion. "
"SpongeBob"," You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy."
"Squidward"," Four... three... two... one... "
"SpongeBob"," I guess we started too early. Let's start again."
"Squidward"," Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot."
"Squidward"," Why are you still here?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January."
"Squidward","  Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!"
"SpongeBob"," You want me to explode?"
"Squidward"," Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, okay, I'll try.  GARY!!!!! YOU ARE GONNA FINISH YOUR DESSERT AND YOU ARE GONNA LIKE IT!!!!  Now it's your turn!"
"Squidward","  THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT YOU BARNACLE HEAD!!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, good one."
"Squidward"," No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! "
"SpongeBob"," Why would I do that?"
"Squidward"," Because the pie you ate was a bomb!"
"SpongeBob"," What pie?"
"Squidward"," The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!"
"SpongeBob"," Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops! "
"Squidward","  Ouch. "
"SpongeBob"," Look Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers."
"Plankton"," Ouch!  And now for the final touch.  Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine. "
"SpongeBob"," Why, yes—yes I am. "
"SpongeBob","  The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary. "
"Plankton","  That's it?  You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton!"
"Plankton","  Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob. "
"Plankton"," You can't do this to me, Krabs!  I went to college!  Ouch."
"Mr. Krabs"," That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square,  and this sponge is Bob,  I will not let you down!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, SpongeBob?  Could you let me down? "
"SpongeBob"," Code twelve, code twelve!  Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy! Just remember the most important rule."
"SpongeBob"," No free napkins?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula."
"SpongeBob"," Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," As long as you do that, the secret is safe."
"Squidward"," I always thought the most important rule was ""why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?"" "
"Mr. Krabs"," What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for."
"Squidward"," Aye aye, captain.  Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties."
"Squidward"," What now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton"," Your boss, your ruler, your master! "
"Squidward"," You're not Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward","  Well... whatever you say, ""Mr. Krabs.""  Whoopee! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton"," Oh, sweet domination. This is it!"
"SpongeBob"," No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good.  Ooh, you're so cold. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob! "
"Plankton"," It's that thick-headed Krabs! He'll ruin everything!"
"SpongeBob"," I got it, I got it!  I got it, I got it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," You gave him the day off."
"Mr. Krabs","  Day...  Off?!  I don't know the meaning of them horrible words!! Now quit your laying around SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Hey Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs! I didn't know you had heat vision!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around.  Get back to the kitchen!"
"SpongeBob"," But I thought you wanted to ask me a question."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes... why aren't you working harder?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. "
"Plankton"," I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day.  It looks like an ordinary penny... because it is an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of...  money!  Hey, where you going, beautiful? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs...  Wha... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop! Please!  Wait! "
"SpongeBob"," Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'."
"SpongeBob"," I can see that, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Isn't that a microphone?"
"SpongeBob"," But sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet."
"SpongeBob","  We don't shake with our hands, remember?"
"SpongeBob"," We stand on one foot.  Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. "
"SpongeBob"," Almost."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry,  no can do, Mr. Krabs. "
"Plankton","  But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!"
"SpongeBob"," It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. "
"Plankton","  This is it, Plankton. Gently, now... "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!"
"SpongeBob","  Quiet!  Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves,  nobody gets hurt."
"Mr. Krabs"," Take it easy with that thing, son. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay then."
"SpongeBob"," First question What time does the Krusty Krab open?"
"SpongeBob"," Right.  That's one strike, Mr. Fake."
"Mr. Krabs"," But..."
"SpongeBob"," Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two How much does a Krabby Patty cost?"
"Mr. Krabs"," $2.99!"
"SpongeBob"," On Wednesday..."
"SpongeBob"," Right again!  You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass?  Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance.  No!"
"SpongeBob"," So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye!  I knew it was you all along Mr. Krabs, here you go. "
"SpongeBob"," Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. "
"SpongeBob"," This must be your lucky day. "
"Plankton"," Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Help!  Ouch! "
"SpongeBob"," If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Help! Get Away! No!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Back you Hungry Hand, back! Help! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony."
"Mr. Krabs"," Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again.  However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck. "
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them? "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird."
"Patrick"," No, that's Italian, SpongeBob. "
"Sandy"," Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day."
"SpongeBob"," This whole sack?"
"Sandy"," No, just a cup's worth.  This here's my cricket.  He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, but I don't speak Italian."
"Sandy"," And this here's Snakey. "
"SpongeBob"," What's that lump in its belly?"
"Sandy"," Well, that's his dinner.  Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go.  See you guys in a couple of days."
"SpongeBob","  Wait! You forgot about this pet!"
"Sandy"," Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much. "
"SpongeBob"," Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella."
"Patrick"," Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo."
"SpongeBob"," Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998, 999, 1, 000. Ready or not, here I come! "
"Patrick"," You found me! "
"Patrick"," Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever."
"SpongeBob"," I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun."
"Patrick"," Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Here I come, Wormy! "
"Patrick"," Me, too!  And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!"
"Patrick"," Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?"
"SpongeBob"," He's gotta be in here.  I think something bad happened to Wormy. "
"Patrick"," He left his ""Best Friend"" ribbon behind! "
"Patrick"," What is that thing?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!"
"Patrick","  Why does this keep happening to me?!"
"SpongeBob"," Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door!  No! Patrick, he's blocking our only exit! "
"Patrick"," Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--""Best Friend Eater."""
"SpongeBob"," Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  He's eaten Patrick!  Patrick, you're alive!"
"Patrick"," I am?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!"
"Patrick"," Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets."
"SpongeBob"," No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!"
"Patrick"," It's for you! "
"SpongeBob"," It's working. He's gonna answer it. "
"Patrick"," Tartar sauce."
"SpongeBob"," You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net. "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold on, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," I really don't taste that good, Mr. Monster. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm coming, Patrick!  No, Mr. Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second.  Yeah!  We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now......heading straight for the Krusty Krab!  It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance. "
"Squidward"," Okay, hold still."
"Patrick"," It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward"," Say ""money."""
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Money!"" "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is he a paying customer?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!"
"Patrick","  Just like it ate Wormy!"
"Squidward"," Um, Wormy? "
"SpongeBob"," Why? Why? He was so young."
"Patrick"," I'll never forget you, Wormy."
"Squidward"," Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster.  That's the monster?"
"Patrick"," Pretty scary, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," A living nightmare!"
"Squidward"," I should have known.  Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous."
"SpongeBob"," We tried to warn them. I can't watch. "
"Squidward"," Get a load of the scary monster.  Monster."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aw, it looks harmless."
"Squidward"," It's kinda cute."
"Mr. Krabs"," It reminds me of money."
"Squidward"," Monster. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Mr. Krabs? "
"SpongeBob","  It ate them! And there it goes!  First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs!  That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll."
"Patrick"," Aye-aye, captain. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity."
"Patrick"," Gotcha."
"SpongeBob"," Run, everybody, run!"
"Patrick"," Monster on the loose!"
"SpongeBob"," Monster! "
"Patrick","  Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you! "
"SpongeBob"," We did it, Patrick! We saved the city.  Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster."
"Patrick"," About the what? "
"Sandy"," Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody?  Oh, hey there Wormy.  You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy.  Howdy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy caught the monster! "
"Sandy"," I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah-ah-achoo!  36 days without a customer."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way!  Uhh... You got money, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Finest under the sea!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No one goes to a restaurant for atmosphere.  They go for food! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring customers back in here!"
"SpongeBob","  I have an idea! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! I've got an idea!  ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive!  No free refills. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What am I going to do? If I don't think of an idea, I'll go out of business!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why can't someone give me an idea?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy?  Tell me!"
"SpongeBob"," OK. Prepare yourself, Mr. Krabs. Don't bother sitting down, Mr. Krabs, because you'll just stand up when you see this!  Ta-da! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat!  Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward! Come look!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't that look appetizing?"
"Squidward"," Mmm, mmm! Good, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's next?  Sequin milkshakes?"
"Squidward","  Bow-tie French fries?"
"SpongeBob","  No..."
"SpongeBob","  Stop it!  I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant!  You'll see!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too?"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter?"
"Patrick"," I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?"
"SpongeBob"," I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so!"
"Patrick","  Me too.  Inflatable pants! What's your idea?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!"
"Patrick","  Forget my dumb idea, that's great!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick?  Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open!  I'm ready!  I'm ready.  I'm ready...  Patrick, how long have we been standing here?"
"Patrick","  Awww! I gotta draw a new battery for this. "
"SpongeBob"," What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, sometimes we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems."
"SpongeBob"," I'm scared."
"Patrick"," Then I'm going in for you! "
"Patrick"," Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants! "
"SpongeBob"," Did you find anything?"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! "
"Patrick","  Green. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pretty Patties? "
"SpongeBob"," Uhhh... I don't know."
"Mr. Krabs"," How can you make money with such a stupid idea?"
"SpongeBob","  At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...  ...shredding it...  ...and burning it!  But in the end, we decided just to give it all away."
"Patrick"," Come again, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't believe it!  I've got to see this for me self! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I've never had a line."
"SpongeBob"," Who's #46,853?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I never had 46,853 customers."
"SpongeBob","  Here you are, sir. Stay pretty.  All right.  Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs?  The Pretty Patties are a big hit!"
"Mr. Krabs"," They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs","  I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs?  That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. "
"SpongeBob"," You will?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!"
"SpongeBob","  What did you say, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's the key to the Krusty Krab.  She's yours now."
"SpongeBob","  Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya."
"SpongeBob"," I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it!  Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!"
"SpongeBob","  Dreams do come true! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ladies and gentlemen! ""Pretty Patties"" is now under new management!  Who's next? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! For me money.  Welcome to Pretty Patties! May I take your money?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Wha-!?! Who? What?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's wrong with you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  My key!  Where's my key?  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, let me in!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Let me in!  SpongeBob, let me in! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Grandma! "
"SpongeBob"," Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies..."
"SpongeBob"," Me, me, me! "
"SpongeBob"," Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Grandma! "
"SpongeBob"," I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today."
"Squidward"," I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you."
"SpongeBob"," Did I do something funny?"
"Squidward"," Your forehead. "
"SpongeBob"," My forehead is funny?"
"SpongeBob"," No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma."
"Squidward"," Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you."
"SpongeBob"," Really? You do, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yeah, your grandma! "
"SpongeBob"," Stop it...!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time! "
"Patrick"," I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Me, too."
"Patrick"," You're the most adult person I know."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick."
"Patrick"," You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how."
"Patrick"," Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say ""tax exemption."""
"SpongeBob"," Tax exemption."
"Patrick"," Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm a grownup."
"Patrick"," No ifs, ands, or buts about it."
"SpongeBob"," A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do."
"Patrick"," And then you get behind her and I'll push."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we didn't say that."
"Patrick"," Oh yeah, right."
"SpongeBob"," All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years. "
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop."
"Patrick"," Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff."
"SpongeBob"," He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way."
"SpongeBob"," I am? I mean, of course I am."
"SpongeBob"," I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. "
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick? "
"Patrick"," Keep 'em coming, Granny! "
"SpongeBob"," So much for no more baby stuff."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby. "
"SpongeBob"," Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?!  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults! "
"Patrick"," I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz."
"SpongeBob","  Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. "
"Patrick"," All right!  Rewards, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz... "
"Patrick"," Oh, Grandma, I'm full. "
"SpongeBob"," It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious."
"Patrick"," Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!"
"SpongeBob"," Storytime? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. "
"Patrick","  D'oh! My wittle finger! "
"Patrick","  Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too. "
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  to find a sweater but puts it on his head] Alright, another hat."
"SpongeBob","  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work."
"SpongeBob"," Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later."
"SpongeBob"," Yep, that is it. Here I go."
"SpongeBob"," Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know when I'll be back."
"SpongeBob"," So, uh... that's it. "
"SpongeBob"," Soo long...  I don't wanna grow up!  I want cookies!  and ""milkie""!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear ""diadies""!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! "
"SpongeBob","  I don't?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look. I got my...  I'm sorry, Patrick.  It's just for a second I thought... "
"Patrick"," Hey, you got the same reef blower as me!  Tag, you're it. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean."
"Patrick"," Sure did."
"SpongeBob"," We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house!  My turn. "
"Squidward"," What is going on out here?"
"SpongeBob"," We're playing with our new reef blowers!"
"Squidward"," Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of."
"SpongeBob"," But it's fun!"
"Squidward"," Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?"
"Patrick"," Like this... "
"Squidward","  Chafed.  Alright, that's...! "
"SpongeBob"," Let's do your house, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter."
"Squidward"," Put my windows back!"
"SpongeBob"," No problem, Squidward! We're on your side!  Any second now… "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would-  I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now! "
"Squidward"," Four-way!"
"Patrick"," I hate this channel."
"Squidward"," No! No! "
"Squidward"," Hello?"
"Squidward"," I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now."
"Squidward"," No. I mean, yes. There's nobody with me. Yes, peace and quiet."
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward","  No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last. "
"Squidward"," Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late! "
"Squidward"," This place is even better than I expected!  302, 303, and 304. Beautiful.  And not a pineapple in sight. "
"Squidward"," Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew."
"Squidward"," 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob! I am finally among my own kind.  Now, goodbye."
"Squidward"," Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today.  I'm my own man.  Now these neighbors know how to live.  Intensive. Hmm… I bet they won't have-  Wow, they have it!  ""Canned Bread""! This town is great!  I would really be impressed if it had---  ---an interpretive dance academy?!?  Yeah! It's even better in a group!  This town is perfect.  A clarinet trio?!  Aah, another great day.  Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today.  It just gets better and better!  All together!  I sorta... don't feel like playing my clarinet today.  Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town ""Squidward's Paradise."" Or perhaps ""too much paradise.""  SpongeBob?  Oops.  Leaves. Just getting the leaves. "
"Squidward"," Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a ""leg"" to stand on! "
"Squidward"," But it's fun!"
"Squidward"," Like this! "
"Squidward"," Tag! You're it! "
"SpongeBob"," Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got the apology cake?  We're ready!"
"Patrick"," Ying! "
"Patrick"," Can I get a large #1, extra size?"
"SpongeBob"," But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins! "
"Patrick"," I love... fried oyster skins. "
"Patrick"," I guess we've got to order inside. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That looked like Squidward!  That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form! "
"Squidward"," Stand back! I've got gardening tools! "
"Squidward"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look! It's Squidward!  Squidward! We finally found you! "
"Patrick"," Are you Squidward now?"
"Squidward"," Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed!… or at least painted a different color."
"Squidward"," Hey, you're right!  And I'm leaving ASAP! "
"SpongeBob"," Are you Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Are you Squidward?  That's OK, take your time. "
"SpongeBob"," Any one of these Squidward's can be the real Squidward, Patrick! "
"Squidward"," Freedom! Woo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, we know one thing it sure isn't that guy!"
"Sandy"," There we go!  SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra...  SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!"
"SpongeBob","  I am raking the leaves."
"Sandy"," But they're still all over the ground!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves."
"Sandy","  Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!"
"SpongeBob"," What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?"
"Sandy","  I told ya, SpongeBob...  I'm hibernating next week."
"SpongeBob"," Hibernating? What's that?"
"Sandy","  It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter."
"SpongeBob"," Can I do that?"
"Sandy","  No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male."
"Sandy","  Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, Sandy? When does your... ""carburation"" begin? "
"Sandy"," In one week!"
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!"
"Sandy"," You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!"
"SpongeBob"," Climb!"
"Sandy"," We gotta jump off of stuff!"
"SpongeBob"," Jump!"
"Sandy"," We gotta ride!"
"SpongeBob"," Ride!"
"Sandy"," I don't wanna go to sleep yet!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait Sandy! "
"Sandy"," I can't burn carbs in my sleep!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?"
"Sandy"," What?!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. "
"Sandy"," Well I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands!  Yee-ha! "
"Sandy"," I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah.  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow."
"Sandy"," I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night Gary. "
"Sandy"," Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? "
"Sandy"," I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun.  Well hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour!  Isn't this great?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before! "
"Sandy"," Ok SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun. We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off.  On your mark... get set..."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?"
"Sandy"," Go!  Come on, SpongeBob. We're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun.  Ok, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park!  This is where the real action is!  This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke.  We're going fly-fishing. "
"SpongeBob","  This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something."
"Sandy"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to... "
"Sandy"," Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite!  Find the hay in the needle stack!  Did you find it?"
"SpongeBob"," Not yet."
"Sandy"," Well I'm going to look over here."
"SpongeBob"," You do that. "
"Sandy"," Found it, SpongeBob!  Come on. Best two out of three."
"SpongeBob"," Gotta hide! Gotta hide!  Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret.  Under a rock? It's so original! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob?  Where are you, little square dude?  SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressins! But... but... he always folds his clothes before running around in the nude! Something terrible must have happened to him!  Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Man the lifeboats!"
"Sandy"," Alpha Team, you search uptown. Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?"
"Sandy"," Now get movin'!  SpongeBob?  Someone look up there.  Put your doors, and friends into it!  Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! "
"Sandy"," Check in this here moist cave! "
"Sandy"," Status report!"
"Sandy"," Well, look again!"
"Sandy"," Well, look again!"
"Squidward"," He's not in my thoughts."
"Sandy"," Well, think again!  Attention Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!"
"Squidward"," How about a break?! We've been at it for days!"
"Sandy"," That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach."
"Sandy"," I heard that!! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!"
"Sandy"," No you ain't! "
"Sandy"," That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow."
"Sandy"," He's not...huh?  They must have gone to search some more.  SpongeBob, where are you?!  You under there?  Nope. "
"SpongeBob","  You said it! Sandy'll never find us!  Hey wait, you don't understand!"
"Squidward","  Oh look, it is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  C'mon, let me back in! You don't understand! "
"Sandy"," Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened!  Come on. There's just enough time to go atom smashing. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, wait!"
"Sandy"," There's no time to wait! Hibernation! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important!  I...am a man!  OK, Sandy, I...I...I...I...I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games! They're tearing me apart!  There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I..."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?  I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! "
"Patrick","  Who are you people?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What a no-good eel-in-a-kelp that guy was!  There ain't nothing worse than a thief! Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob","  Like that barrel.  It says, ""Property of Salty Sea Farms""."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from."
"SpongeBob"," Are you renting the barrel, too?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, no."
"SpongeBob"," Then you bought it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Then, isn't that stealing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I, uh..."
"Patrick","  What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Um... Well.."
"SpongeBob","  And this Bikini Bell phone?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, uh, it's"
"Patrick","  And Sandy's hedge clippers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, they're..."
"SpongeBob"," ...And Plankton's lawn mower? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he..."
"SpongeBob","  Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers?"
"Mr. Krabs","  That one was a gift!  Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed."
"SpongeBob"," Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without  permission."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back  before it's missed.  Everyone knows that! Right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right then!  Hugs?  You put in  a hard day's work, boys!"
"Patrick"," But I don't work here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," See you later! Oh, that was a close one."
"SpongeBob","  What do you want to do today?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. What do you want to do today?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. What do you want to do today?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. What do you want to do today?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. What do you want to do today?"
"Patrick"," I know what I want to do today!  I need some money.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh...   I don't have any money.  SpongeBob, I want a balloon really, really badly!  Really, really badly!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Patrick. There's lots of money in  the First National Bank of SpongeBob.  Follow me!  Uh-oh. I'm broke, too.  and Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward?"
"Patrick"," No, wait!  Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," It's just borrowing, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right?"
"Patrick"," Right!"
"Patrick"," This is so great!"
"SpongeBob"," We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop!"
"Patrick"," And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!"
"SpongeBob"," And the candy shop!"
"Patrick"," And then my backyard!"
"SpongeBob"," And in a plane!"
"Patrick"," And over a rock!"
"SpongeBob"," And under a hill!"
"Patrick"," And with a whale!"
"SpongeBob"," It popped."
"Patrick"," How are we going to return it now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I got the pieces!"
"Patrick","  I got the air!"
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, put the pieces on!  We popped the balloon!"
"Patrick"," Ga-heh!"
"SpongeBob"," We can't return it!"
"Patrick"," Wha-guh!"
"SpongeBob"," We're thieves!"
"Patrick"," Hi-yo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob"," We have to confess."
"Patrick"," Confess?!  Are you out of your mind?! Do you have any idea what they do to people like us? We're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here.   We stole a Balloon!   And they're going to lock us up forever."
"SpongeBob"," You're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal."
"Patrick"," He's onto us!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks."
"Patrick","  I'm on it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back."
"Patrick","  Goodbye, Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob","  We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs."
"Patrick","  Yup."
"SpongeBob"," We're going to have to travel lighter."
"Patrick"," I wanna go home."
"SpongeBob"," We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men.  We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warmer on the fire."
"Patrick"," Hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a..."
"Patrick"," I'm scared, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," No more nice, warm beds."
"Patrick"," Hey."
"SpongeBob","  No more Krabby Patties."
"Patrick"," Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," No more getting mail!   No more Gary!   No more movies!  No more Squidward!   No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs!   No more anything!"
"Patrick","  I want ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean, at least we have each other."
"Patrick","  Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," And  all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right? "
"Patrick","  And the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun!  We can loosen our ties."
"Patrick"," Yeah!  And we can fly!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!  Okay... we still can't do that!   But at least we don't have to shave."
"Patrick","  I'm way ahead of you, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," And you get to talk tough!   This town ain't big enough for the two of us."
"Patrick"," Uh, let me try  Uh...hey, punk."
"SpongeBob"," And the best part is now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed!"
"Patrick"," And we owe it all to  you."
"SpongeBob"," What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan."
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm nothing but a lot of talk! You're the one with the sticky fingers."
"SpongeBob","  Aw, Patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever!"
"Patrick"," You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though."
"SpongeBob","  Look what I've got!"
"Patrick","  Rectangles!"
"SpongeBob"," Not just any rectangles... Candy bars!"
"Patrick"," Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives!"
"Patrick"," Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Who?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it."
"SpongeBob"," You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face."
"Patrick","  Where'd it go? I'm gonna starve.  Where'd it go?"
"Patrick"," I can't find it!  Where could it possibly be?  Ahaha!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," You stole my candy bar!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I didn't."
"Patrick"," Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Once a thief, always a thief."
"SpongeBob"," You ate yours,  this is mine."
"Patrick"," You took my only food,  now I'm gonna starve."
"SpongeBob","  Here Patrick, just take half of mine."
"Patrick"," Yours? You mean mine."
"SpongeBob"," Do you want it or what?"
"Patrick"," I don't want it unless you admit you took it."
"SpongeBob"," This is my candy bar!"
"Patrick"," Liar, liar, plants for hire."
"SpongeBob"," It's ""pants on fire"", Patrick."
"Patrick"," Well, you would know... liar."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself."
"Patrick"," You better not!   I'm warning you!"
"Patrick"," Don't!"
"Patrick"," Stop it!"
"Patrick","   Don't!  Oh!"
"Patrick","  Ah!   Ah!   You're a crazy person! I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon!"
"SpongeBob"," Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!"
"Patrick"," Oh, that's it!  Yow!  First the balloon, now my candy bar... you're out of control! I'm...  ...I'm telling on you."
"SpongeBob","   Not if I tell on you first!"
"Patrick"," I'll beat you there!"
"SpongeBob"," You're going to get in trouble."
"Patrick"," No, you are!"
"Patrick","  I'm not good."
"SpongeBob","  We stole a balloon."
"SpongeBob","  What are you going to do to us?"
"SpongeBob"," But...But...we stole a balloon."
"SpongeBob"," Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again."
"Patrick"," You said it!  All right! Which one of you flatfoots stole my lollipop?  I mean it."
"SpongeBob"," I sure am!  I'm ready! "
"SpongeBob","  Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. "
"SpongeBob"," What diabolical act is she committing now?  Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire!  Huh? So I guess there's no fire?"
"Sandy"," What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?"
"SpongeBob"," Christmas who?"
"Sandy"," What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?"
"SpongeBob"," Is she a friend from Texas?"
"Sandy","  No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas."
"SpongeBob"," Tell me more about this...  ...""Christmas."""
"SpongeBob","  And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake."
"Squidward"," Yawn."
"SpongeBob"," But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you."
"Patrick"," Just like a genie. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine."
"SpongeBob"," That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter."
"Squidward"," I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts."
"Patrick"," Like a genie. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus."
"Squidward"," Oh, brother."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, who's next?"
"Patrick"," Ooh, ooh, me, me!"
"Squidward"," Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Patrick."
"Patrick"," There's no words on this paper."
"SpongeBob"," Not yet."
"Patrick"," ' Yippee! A writing stick."
"SpongeBob"," C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward."
"Patrick"," Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again."
"SpongeBob"," Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!"
"Patrick"," Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?"
"SpongeBob"," Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go."
"SpongeBob"," Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A pony."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," With saddle bags full of money! "
"Patrick"," Here you go, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What did you wish for, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Another piece of paper. "
"SpongeBob"," And what did you wish for, little girl?"
"Squidward"," Excuse me, coming through, out of the way."
"SpongeBob"," Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?"
"Squidward"," My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival."
"Squidward"," ♪Sounds like someone felled my old coral tree! SpongeBob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me?♪"
"Squidward"," ♪Go away before I harm you bodily!♪"
"Squidward"," ♪What? Who, me? Would you look at the time, I should go!♪"
"Plankton"," ♪People seem a little more brotherly!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Here's a special something to you from me!♪"
"SpongeBob","  Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha..."
"Patrick","  Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha..."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?  Hey Sandy, what's with the sign?"
"Patrick"," Look, she's on the Eating Channel."
"Sandy","  Howdy!  If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb.  That means you, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," We better put these on."
"SpongeBob"," Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray."
"Patrick"," When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? ""No"" means ""yes""!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, look at this! "
"SpongeBob"," What is this stuff? "
"Patrick"," It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before."
"SpongeBob","  Wow, Pat, that was beautiful!"
"Patrick"," What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!"
"Patrick"," It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look! "
"SpongeBob"," I guess you're right. It's okay here!"
"Patrick"," Take it off. No one's looking.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?"
"SpongeBob"," I think it came from Sandy's tree."
"Patrick"," That is one tired tree."
"SpongeBob"," Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed! "
"Patrick"," Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!"
"SpongeBob"," I think this thing is Sandy."
"Patrick"," Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep."
"Sandy","  I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy... "
"SpongeBob","  She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan."
"Sandy"," I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you better run faster, Sandy."
"Patrick"," Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster! "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!"
"Patrick"," Faster, faster! "
"Sandy"," I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics... "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore."
"Patrick"," That's not disturbing. This is disturbing!  Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback."
"SpongeBob"," Ha! That is really disturbing!"
"Patrick"," Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Huh? "
"Patrick"," Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! No! Stop!"
"Sandy"," I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!"
"Sandy"," Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots... "
"Patrick"," Fun's over."
"SpongeBob"," Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her."
"Patrick"," Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Pat! "
"Sandy"," I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, that oughta work."
"Patrick","  Hey Sandy, does it work? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!"
"Patrick"," Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up! "
"SpongeBob"," See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!"
"Patrick"," You'll never catch me!  Hey that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons."
"SpongeBob"," They couldn't afford station wagons either! "
"Patrick"," Nice paneling."
"SpongeBob"," All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! "
"Patrick"," Who you calling Pinhead? I want to be Dirty Dan!"
"SpongeBob"," What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?"
"Patrick"," I'm dirty. "
"SpongeBob"," I say I'm Dirty Dan. "
"Patrick"," I say I'm Dirty Dan! "
"SpongeBob","  I say I'm Dirty Dan!"
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan."
"SpongeBob","  I'm Dirty Dan!"
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan."
"SpongeBob","  I'm Dirty Dan!"
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan."
"SpongeBob","  I'm Dirty Dan!"
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan."
"SpongeBob","  I'm Dirty Dan!"
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan."
"SpongeBob","  I'm Dirty Dan!  "
"Patrick","  I'm Dirty Dan.  Screaming will get you no- "
"Sandy","  Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?!"
"Patrick"," Uh? I am? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Hot wings! "
"Sandy"," Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours!  Pinhead!  Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, stay back. I'm warning ya!  Okay, I warned ya! "
"Patrick"," Did you win?  Hi, SpongeBob!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! "
"Patrick"," Ouch! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!"
"Patrick"," Let me have a try.  Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do."
"SpongeBob"," Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring."
"Patrick"," Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?"
"SpongeBob"," N-n-n-no. "
"Patrick"," I'm so cold that I'm shivering! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm so cold that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks! "
"Patrick"," I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! "
"Sandy","  You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! "
"SpongeBob"," The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"
"Patrick"," Maybe she just ignores it."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe?"
"Patrick"," Maybe?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe it's her fur! "
"SpongeBob"," Look at all that warm, toasty fur!"
"Patrick"," It's like a gold mine, but with fur. "
"SpongeBob"," Carefully...carefully? "
"Patrick"," Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right? "
"Patrick"," Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I've lived a full life! "
"Patrick"," This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW! "
"SpongeBob"," Pat, no! "
"SpongeBob"," Pat, are you crazy?! "
"Patrick"," No, I'm warm."
"SpongeBob"," Let me see that roll of tape."
"Patrick"," Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits. "
"SpongeBob"," And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had."
"Patrick"," You said it!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!"
"SpongeBob"," Spring?"
"Sandy","  Wow, spring already?"
"SpongeBob"," Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!"
"Sandy","  I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!"
"Sandy"," Oh look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"Sandy"," Hey, guys!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! "
"Sandy","   SpongeBob... Patrick..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered."
"Sandy","  More lemonade, boys? "
"Sandy"," Spring sure is lovely."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've got ya now, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Tag, you're it!  Gary will never find me here!  Uh-oh.  Tag! Now I'm it! "
"Patrick"," Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us?"
"Patrick"," Oh boy, would I!"
"SpongeBob","  OK,  Tag, you're it! "
"Patrick"," I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!  Tag, you're it! I win, I win!  What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! "
"SpongeBob"," That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!"
"Patrick","  It tickles! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gar-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary.  Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.  What about you, Gary?  Gary? Gary? "
"Patrick","  Brush brush brush, brush brush brush… "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?"
"Patrick","  Brush brush brush,  Brushin' everywhere…  Nope.  Oh, hey, here he is! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep."
"Patrick"," Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's a great idea!"
"Patrick"," A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games… "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover."
"Patrick"," And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…"
"SpongeBob"," OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. "
"Patrick"," Blah blah blah blah blah… "
"SpongeBob"," I'm awake!"
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey guys, how was the sleepover?"
"Patrick"," Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows!  See? "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee!  Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me?  You're not chasing me… "
"Patrick"," Come on Gary, let's play a different game. "
"SpongeBob"," Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of…  …you… What's wrong with me?  Do I offend?  Hey Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball!  Hey Gary, look! Snail-nip!  Huh? Huh-huh?  Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head!  All right, that's it!  Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! OK, that's it mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say good-bye to Patrick, Gary. "
"Patrick"," Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!"
"SpongeBob"," What's that supposed to mean?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. So I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. "
"SpongeBob"," Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! OK, Gary, go ahead, show him. OK Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! "
"Patrick"," Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do."
"SpongeBob","  OK, fine, if that's how you want to thank me…  ...for all that I've done?!  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone who's name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary."
"SpongeBob"," And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da.  Bon appetite, Lary.  OK, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I…  I guess you can sleep there…  I'll just sleep down here.  Well, good-night, Lary.  Hey Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it Larry? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh Gary, why did you have to go?!  Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why?!  Gary? "
"Patrick"," Hi SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Gary."
"Patrick"," Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?"
"SpongeBob"," Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…"
"Patrick"," And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?"
"SpongeBob"," Soap? But… we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… "
"Patrick"," Here it comes…"
"SpongeBob"," Du… du… duuuuu…  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? "
"Patrick"," How pathetic…"
"SpongeBob"," Gary…? "
"Patrick"," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! "
"SpongeBob"," G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww…  Let's go for a walk, pal! "
"Patrick"," Gary? I thought what we had was special...!"
"SpongeBob","  Whahappen?"
"SpongeBob"," How many does that leave me with?"
"SpongeBob"," How many more minutes left in the test?"
"SpongeBob"," That's enough time, I can make up those points! "
"SpongeBob"," OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoo."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!  Well, see you next Tuesday!  Yeah!  I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year.  One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! "
"SpongeBob"," What was that, Mrs. Puff? "
"SpongeBob"," What's extra credit?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh….. "
"SpongeBob"," Extra credit!"
"SpongeBob"," But I've learned so many things."
"SpongeBob","  L… e… a… r…  Oh, barnacles."
"SpongeBob"," Got to sharpen my pencil.  N… e… "
"SpongeBob"," A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils.  Gonna write an essay, that's what I say.  There."
"SpongeBob"," No, wait! I changed my mind! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't look! It's not ready."
"SpongeBob"," I can do this! I can do this!"
"SpongeBob"," I can do this! I can do this!  Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here?  My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! "
"SpongeBob"," It's not ready yet."
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-"
"SpongeBob"," Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!  La La La La!  La La La La! "
"SpongeBob"," La la la la!"
"SpongeBob"," To the greatest teacher ever!"
"SpongeBob"," For me...? "
"SpongeBob"," What I learned in Boating School today is!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I'm driving!  Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray!  Somebody help me! Somebody help me! "
"SpongeBob"," Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even…  Giant clams?!  I'm… not… letting… go… not even for…  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little…  educational television?! Oh, no! "
"SpongeBob"," I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were…  … Mrs. Puff?  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?"
"SpongeBob","  Free driving lessons! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I can't believe it! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention!"
"Patrick"," Jellyfish are awesome!"
"SpongeBob"," Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets!"
"Patrick","  Touch."
"SpongeBob","  Wow! The harpoon from ""Jellyfish The Movie!"""
"Patrick","  Touch."
"SpongeBob","  Look! Dr. Manowar! The guy who got stung by Big Lenny and lived!"
"Patrick"," Touch."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Patrick, look! Can it be?"
"Patrick"," Ice cream?"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's the Jellyspotters!  Bikini Bottom's premier jellyfish enthusiast club! Ah! And their leader! The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever!  Kevin the Sea Cucumber!"
"Patrick"," What's so great about a nerdy pickle?"
"SpongeBob"," If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky.  Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you! "
"SpongeBob","  Hi, Kevin."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Kevin."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Kevin."
"SpongeBob","  Hi, Kevin."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan."
"SpongeBob"," No, wait! I would do anything for you!"
"SpongeBob"," Anything!"
"SpongeBob","  Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin? "
"SpongeBob","  I'd love it!  "
"SpongeBob","  Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh... "
"SpongeBob"," I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk.  I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter?  and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and-"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Uh, Let's see, one, two, three? "
"SpongeBob"," Who wants to lick my cheeks?  I see I have some takers?"
"SpongeBob","  It tickles my nose!"
"SpongeBob"," Am I in the Jellyspotters now?"
"SpongeBob"," Am I in the Jellyspotters now? "
"SpongeBob"," Am I in the Jellyspotters now? "
"SpongeBob"," Now? "
"SpongeBob"," Now? "
"SpongeBob"," Now? "
"SpongeBob"," Now?  Now?  Now? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," A queen? Can I help?"
"SpongeBob"," This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I've heard this call before."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where are you going?"
"SpongeBob"," This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter!  Hey Kevin, I don't think it's working. Nothing?  Hey, hey Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She's here?  Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go!  Kevin!"
"SpongeBob"," But... What about my final test? "
"SpongeBob"," But Kevin, I was your biggest fan!"
"SpongeBob"," I am not a loser!"
"SpongeBob"," King Jellyfish! "
"SpongeBob","  Now what do we do? "
"SpongeBob","  Everybody loves pie!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I didn't know this was a hat! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!"
"Patrick"," Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson.  Hero worship is unhealthy.  C'mon, Jeffrey."
"SpongeBob"," ManSponge..."
"Patrick"," ...and BoyPatrick"
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!"
"Patrick"," I'll get the Aqua-Glove."
"SpongeBob"," What about the Orb of Confusion? "
"Patrick","  What about the Invisible Boatmobile?"
"SpongeBob"," Come boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay. "
"Patrick"," Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA..."
"SpongeBob"," What is it, trusted sidekick?"
"Patrick"," MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?"
"SpongeBob"," Looks like he's frozen or something."
"Patrick"," FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!"
"SpongeBob"," It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him.  Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!"
"Patrick"," But you said you had a question."
"SpongeBob"," We could get in trouble."
"Patrick"," Well, that's not a question. "
"SpongeBob"," He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, actually, Mr. uh...Man Ray, sir, only your head is free."
"SpongeBob"," Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that."
"SpongeBob"," Because you're evil!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, sure, why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Really, really?"
"SpongeBob"," Really, really, really?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's good enough for me. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17."
"Patrick"," Oh, I love that episode."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, me too, me too."
"SpongeBob"," Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle..."
"SpongeBob"," We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?"
"Patrick"," Doesn't look familiar to me."
"Patrick"," Nope, it's not mine."
"Patrick"," Return what to who?"
"Patrick"," Yup."
"Patrick"," Yup."
"Patrick"," That makes sense to me."
"Patrick"," It's not my wallet."
"SpongeBob"," No. Wrong.  Good people don't rip other people's arms off!  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggle with a heavy package. What do you do?"
"Patrick"," Oops, sorry. Can I start over?"
"Patrick"," Oops. Gotta start again. "
"Patrick"," Oops!"
"Patrick"," My wallets."
"Patrick"," No! SpongeBob, tickle him! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see. "
"Patrick"," I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?"
"Patrick"," Wrong! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good."
"Patrick"," Let go of it, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad."
"Patrick"," Let go!"
"SpongeBob"," No, you let go!"
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word."
"Patrick"," Peanuts?"
"SpongeBob"," No. Please."
"Patrick"," Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted."
"SpongeBob"," Rehabilitated."
"Patrick"," Gesundheit."
"SpongeBob"," It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch that, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir.  Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooose!"
"Patrick"," What's that smell, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat."
"Patrick"," Good, I thought it was my skin."
"SpongeBob"," Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man..."
"Patrick"," ...and Barnacle Boy! "
"SpongeBob"," To the Invisible Boatmobile! "
"Patrick"," Ignition, on!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I don't have a license."
"Patrick"," Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. "
"SpongeBob"," You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. "
"Patrick"," Thank goodness for invisible seat belts."
"SpongeBob"," Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion.  Take this!  Doy. Duh."
"SpongeBob"," Doy.  Man-Ray!"
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Uhh... "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams. "
"SpongeBob","  I hope I do as good as that guy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants. "
"Sandy"," Go get 'em, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick","  Whoo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?"
"SpongeBob"," And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? "
"SpongeBob"," Umm, noxious gas?"
"SpongeBob"," Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh..."
"SpongeBob","  Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? "
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home too. "
"Patrick","  Squirrel fur!"
"SpongeBob"," And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?"
"SpongeBob"," Because, they're so darn stupid! "
"Patrick"," That's a good one, huh, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Uhh, y-yeah... "
"Mr. Krabs"," That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!"
"SpongeBob"," I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is."
"Mr. Krabs"," The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show. "
"SpongeBob"," At least I don't have to clean up my act! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy. "
"SpongeBob"," Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh hey, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Did you enjoy the show?"
"Sandy"," Well, ac-actually SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it."
"SpongeBob"," Come on Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom."
"Sandy"," Well, I can't argue with that."
"SpongeBob"," We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! "
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Sandy"," Hmph!  Hello, little critter! What's your name?"
"Sandy"," Stupidity isn't a virus, but it sure is spreading like it. "
"SpongeBob"," La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid."
"Sandy"," Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes."
"SpongeBob"," We already talked about that, remember? "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels. "
"Sandy"," Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around."
"Sandy"," I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, OK? Tell some of them other jokes you got."
"SpongeBob","  Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them."
"Sandy","  Thanks SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one."
"Sandy"," I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere."
"Patrick"," Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, hey, what about this thing!  Huh? Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make  your friends  or your career."
"SpongeBob"," Howdy, y'all!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?"
"SpongeBob","  My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?"
"Sandy","  I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter? "
"Sandy","  You were right SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy."
"SpongeBob"," You did it SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, are you feeling alright?"
"Sandy"," I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off! "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat."
"Sandy"," Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase! "
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, that, that's not a... "
"Sandy"," Ain't that purdy?"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, I need wa..."
"Sandy"," Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh...  Sea critters need, uhh..."
"SpongeBob"," Wa..."
"Sandy"," Oh wait, don't tell me. I know this one!"
"SpongeBob"," Wa..."
"Sandy"," Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! Water!"
"Sandy"," Well, why didn't you just say so!  Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Okay Sandy, I get it!"
"Sandy"," What's that? You want more?  Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay Sandy, Okay! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!"
"SpongeBob"," Crabs? Oh brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!"
"Mr. Krabs","  It's true, I am cheap!"
"SpongeBob"," Now let me tell you about those fish? Boy are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really!  Soap... soap... what is... soap?  And don't even get me started on starfish!"
"Sandy","  You know, SpongeBob, sometimes it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by."
"SpongeBob"," Yup, and just relax."
"Sandy"," Yeah. Relax."
"SpongeBob"," Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?"
"Sandy"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," A flower."
"Sandy"," They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time."
"SpongeBob"," They sure do."
"Sandy"," You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty."
"SpongeBob"," Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?"
"Sandy"," Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest."
"Sandy"," Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? "
"SpongeBob"," I thought that meant you were nuts."
"Sandy"," Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land."
"SpongeBob","  Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, ""Miss Mittens""?"
"Sandy"," I'd say I'm already halfway there!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!"
"Sandy"," Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey!  You did that on purpose!"
"Sandy"," Yeah, but this is an accident! "
"SpongeBob","  Aaaaah!"
"Sandy"," Too bad you forgot your umbrella!"
"SpongeBob","  I didn't! "
"Sandy","  Well. It's about time you showed up."
"SpongeBob","  I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!"
"Sandy"," Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter."
"SpongeBob"," I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?"
"Sandy"," Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?"
"SpongeBob"," I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!."
"Sandy","  Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy","  Thanks for the face lift!  You see, I told you that you didn't-"
"SpongeBob","  There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting! "
"Sandy"," I thought y'all wanted a rematch."
"SpongeBob"," I did! And I took a head start like you did!"
"Sandy"," Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!"
"SpongeBob"," I guess I don't, air breather!"
"Sandy"," Water sucker!"
"SpongeBob"," Tree climber!"
"Sandy"," Gulf streamer!"
"SpongeBob"," Kite flier!"
"Sandy"," Chum chewer!"
"SpongeBob","  Take that back! You-  not wet person!"
"Sandy"," Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!"
"SpongeBob"," Proves what?"
"Sandy"," That land critters are better than sea critters!"
"Patrick","  Better at what?"
"Squidward","  What's she blabbering about?"
"Patrick"," She says land creatures are best."
"Sandy"," Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking  and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!"
"Sandy"," And name calling, for sure!"
"Squidward"," And drowning, don't forget drowning!"
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Squidward!  Woo!"
"Squidward"," Not on your life, sport. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel.  But you're still just a land creature."
"Sandy"," Squirrels can do anything they want to!"
"Patrick"," I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite.  Ah."
"Sandy","  Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. "
"Patrick"," Thank you, thank you."
"Sandy"," Well, there's just one thing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Can you do this?  Everyone in my family can do that."
"Sandy","  Uh...uh..."
"Squidward"," How about this?  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Can you reproduce by budding.  Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?"
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Most importantly...can you do this? "
"Sandy"," Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here! "
"Sandy"," Well, you know...  I don't need to...  Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit!  And I don't need this helmet neither! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Neptune preserve her!"
"Squidward"," How long can she stay like that?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know!"
"Patrick"," Sandy's a girl?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe...  Yep, won't be long now.  Feelin' light-headed yet?"
"Sandy"," Mm-mm. "
"SpongeBob"," Remember this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's free! "
"Sandy","  Stop laughing at me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew it! There was no way some ""airhead"" was gonna win anything against a water breather!"
"Patrick"," Airhead...  Huh? "
"Sandy"," All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!"
"Squidward"," Do we have to wear pickle jars? "
"Sandy"," Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs."
"SpongeBob"," One minute? No problem, Landy! "
"Sandy","  Well? So are you going or not?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, you know, but..."
"Squidward"," We can't, uh...because..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, um... we're late for our..."
"Patrick"," Our fitting!"
"Sandy"," Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!"
"Patrick","  Hey! We are not chicken!  Huh! My popcorn! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it.  There. Mission accomplished."
"Sandy"," Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!"
"SpongeBob"," No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!"
"SpongeBob"," Where not afraid of your dumb old land!"
"SpongeBob"," We're sea creatures!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay... Well, this is it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, boy!  Make it last."
"SpongeBob","  Thanks Mr. Krabs Ok! Here I go!  Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!"
"Patrick"," I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball!  Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! "
"SpongeBob"," Looking good, Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.  ...What?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, here we are. "
"Squidward"," This is pretty easy."
"Patrick"," I may keep a second rock up here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!"
"SpongeBob"," We're the masters of land and sea!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? "
"Sandy"," 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them.  SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to?  Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy."
"Sandy"," You know, everyone's best at something."
"SpongeBob"," But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip hip!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hip hip!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aha! Top of the mornin', boys!  Whew! Next stop gift shop."
"SpongeBob"," There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!"
"SpongeBob","  He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!"
"Patrick"," Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!"
"Patrick"," This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air!  Right? I'll try my oyster call."
"Patrick"," Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, come on, wake up already!  I think it's working!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, it's waking up!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy, did I miss it?"
"SpongeBob"," No, the show's about to begin!"
"Patrick"," Now, this is a show!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh..."
"Patrick"," No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Right. "
"Patrick"," Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like ""you""... and... ""are"" ... and... ""a jerk!"""
"Patrick"," Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?"
"SpongeBob"," I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!"
"Patrick"," Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!"
"SpongeBob"," Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate. Now go home!  Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory."
"SpongeBob","  No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?"
"SpongeBob"," Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now, who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, neighbor."
"Squidward"," Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!"
"SpongeBob"," Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster."
"Squidward"," You mean you know the guy who did it?!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically."
"Squidward"," You mean you don't know who did it?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, um... I... uh... no.  Squidward? "
"Patrick"," Gotcha! "
"Patrick"," Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!"
"SpongeBob"," Um... have you found out anything?"
"Patrick"," Yes! No, wait, uh... no.  But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, and so does this rock!  And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!"
"SpongeBob"," I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!"
"Sandy"," Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!"
"Sandy"," Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?"
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?"
"SpongeBob"," Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!  This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it!  Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, uh, just a second!"
"SpongeBob"," Y-y-yes?"
"SpongeBob","  Y-yes! "
"SpongeBob"," Yes... "
"SpongeBob"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob","  Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!  Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!"
"Patrick"," I get what I deserve!  Ouch."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!"
"Patrick","  Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I..."
"SpongeBob"," I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, top of the mornin'! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," I knew it!"
"SpongeBob"," Mother of pearl! That oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But it's... Free Day!"
"SpongeBob","  Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!"
"Squidward"," That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!"
"SpongeBob"," I know! What do you think we should name it?"
"Patrick"," How about..."
"Squidward"," Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!"
"SpongeBob"," We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! "
"Patrick"," Clean..."
"Squidward","  Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing."
"SpongeBob"," Wouldn't that be the top? "
"SpongeBob"," Squid, wait! Wait!"
"Patrick"," Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  Ship!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?"
"SpongeBob"," No, look, a giant ship!"
"Squidward"," Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
"Squidward"," That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place."
"SpongeBob"," Squid, wait! "
"Squidward"," All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! "
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't this place seem familiar?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. Why?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? "
"Patrick"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. "
"SpongeBob"," No, no, it's not ""rawr!"""
"SpongeBob"," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
"SpongeBob"," It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. "
"Squidward"," I...no, I don't."
"SpongeBob"," Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? "
"Squidward","  I never said that."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. "
"Squidward","  Ow."
"SpongeBob","  That was a closer one! "
"Squidward"," Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... "
"Patrick"," Probably. "
"Patrick"," Uhh..."
"Squidward","  No, no, they're not. Whew. "
"Squidward"," Will we be getting business cards?"
"Squidward"," Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? "
"SpongeBob"," No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman."
"Patrick"," We'll do anything you say!"
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!"
"Patrick"," And I got this hat!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably..."
"Patrick"," No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary."
"SpongeBob"," Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!"
"Patrick"," I don't get it."
"SpongeBob"," Look, it's easy, it simply means that..."
"SpongeBob"," So, you don't want it to look good?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare. "
"Patrick"," Moving behind the rocks! "
"SpongeBob"," Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches."
"SpongeBob"," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again."
"Patrick"," How does he do that?"
"SpongeBob"," You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?"
"Patrick"," Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!"
"SpongeBob"," Like movie passes?"
"Patrick"," Or an oversized coffee mug?! "
"SpongeBob"," You're setting us free?"
"Patrick"," Wait, I have an idea!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?! What is it?"
"Patrick"," Let's leave!"
"SpongeBob"," But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. "
"Patrick"," Let's do it. "
"SpongeBob"," I always hate going in there!"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob","  Wait! Listen! "
"SpongeBob"," Never!"
"SpongeBob"," No! "
"Patrick"," It would seem we have reached an impasse."
"Patrick"," Make it five."
"Patrick"," Three. Take it or leave it."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?"
"Patrick"," Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! "
"Squidward"," Boy, I'm glad all that's over! "
"SpongeBob"," Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one."
"Squidward"," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!"
"Patrick"," Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's not right because... "
"SpongeBob"," That's you, Patrick. Make your wish."
"Patrick"," Uhh..."
"Squidward"," Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before."
"Patrick"," Uhh..."
"SpongeBob"," That's not gonna do it! Think harder!"
"Patrick"," Uhh..."
"Patrick"," Uhh...  Okay! I've got it."
"Patrick","  Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? "
"Squidward"," You wished for gum?"
"Patrick"," Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!"
"Patrick"," Aaaah! Let us out!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!"
"Squidward"," That's right! And you know what I wish?"
"Patrick"," No!"
"Squidward"," I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hi."
"Squidward"," That's not what I meant!"
"SpongeBob"," And what did you say your name was?"
"Squidward"," I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. "
"Squidward"," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! "
"SpongeBob"," We're home!"
"Patrick"," You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!"
"Squidward"," But why have we been turned into fruits? "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? ""New"" Boomerang Pet Ball Really Works! Hmmm. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry you had to see that.  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath.  What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da...  That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen...  40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest."
"SpongeBob"," Why no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub.  It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to...  Gary, could you...  Gary, no!  Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to ""chair"" with you.  ""Dishes"" more like it. ""Water"" you waiting for, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant.  I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now."
"SpongeBob"," I am so the boss of you!"
"SpongeBob"," It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules."
"SpongeBob"," Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say.  What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister.  Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One,  two,  two and a half...  don't make me say three!  Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!!  I'm a dirty boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah, Gary.  I'm getting behind my ears. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time!  I've got a card game tonight. "
"SpongeBob"," Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. "
"SpongeBob","  Plankton?!  But Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy!  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! "
"Plankton"," Ouch. "
"SpongeBob"," Why would you play cards with him?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose! "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I lost."
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't lose any money.  I lost..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I lost... "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I lost...  you!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I bet your contract and I lost. "
"SpongeBob"," Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties.  "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. "
"Squidward"," Please tell me this isn't a joke."
"SpongeBob"," Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. "
"Plankton"," As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob.  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. "
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!"
"Plankton","  What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! "
"Plankton"," This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back? "
"SpongeBob"," What is this place? "
"Plankton"," Ok, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! "
"SpongeBob"," Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh..."
"Plankton"," Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking. "
"SpongeBob"," The sign says ""kitchen"", but my heart says ""jail"". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪It's just a greasy spoon♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪"
"Plankton"," What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef."
"Plankton"," Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Plankton"," Hi!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!"
"Plankton"," Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding."
"SpongeBob"," Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab."
"Plankton"," Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I usually cook on a grill."
"Plankton"," You got it!  Well it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way."
"Plankton"," Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?"
"SpongeBob"," A little more to the left."
"Plankton"," How's this, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Move it over a little more."
"Plankton"," Here?"
"SpongeBob"," Keep going."
"Plankton"," Here?"
"SpongeBob"," Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right. "
"Plankton","  Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Ok, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!"
"SpongeBob"," It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!"
"Plankton"," Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?"
"SpongeBob"," Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!"
"Plankton"," So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Well... "
"Plankton"," You ready to make some patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait till I finish my ice cream! "
"Plankton","  How about those patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Faster! Faster! "
"Plankton"," And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?"
"SpongeBob"," All this preparation is making me hungry."
"Plankton"," Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos."
"Plankton","  Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?"
"SpongeBob","  No, I don't really feel like it!"
"Plankton"," But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!"
"SpongeBob"," Tell you what, half-pint why don't you ask me later!"
"Plankton","  I command you to make me a patty this instant!"
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Plankton"," Don't back sass me!"
"SpongeBob","  Do ba da ma!"
"Plankton"," What?!  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know.  You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response Why don't you ask me later?"
"Plankton","  What? What?!"
"SpongeBob"," Get welded."
"Plankton","  Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't wanna."
"Plankton"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?"
"Plankton","  I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square."
"Mr. Krabs"," Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now."
"Plankton"," Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands."
"Plankton"," It's a deal! I cheated anyway."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! "
"Plankton"," Thank you!  Ouch."
"SpongeBob"," My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby?  I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what I thought you said."
"SpongeBob"," OK. Ready, Patrick? One..."
"Patrick"," Two..."
"SpongeBob"," Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One..."
"SpongeBob"," three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper? "
"Patrick"," What is that thing SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," It looks like a giant pencil."
"Patrick"," Go touch it."
"SpongeBob"," It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it."
"Patrick"," Whatcha drawin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!"
"Patrick"," Psh, artists."
"SpongeBob"," It's a jellyfish."
"Patrick"," Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, everybody's a critic."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!"
"SpongeBob"," Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!"
"Patrick"," No, I mean it's swimming away!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you know what this means, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Your art can never hang in a museum."
"SpongeBob"," It means we found a magic pencil!"
"Patrick"," Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true."
"SpongeBob","  Coming right up! "
"Patrick"," Life is good!  Easy come, easy go."
"Squidward"," Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of...  hair!"
"Patrick"," My turn!"
"SpongeBob"," Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such."
"Patrick"," Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon."
"SpongeBob"," Okay! Why didn't you say so?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Another jellyfish!"
"Patrick"," It's Squidward, silly!"
"SpongeBob"," It's kind of creepy looking when it moves."
"Patrick"," You're right, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," We can't let it go into town! "
"Patrick"," Poor Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!"
"Squidward","  I think I fancy a stroll around the park."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action! "
"Patrick"," He's going to the door."
"SpongeBob"," He's knocking on the door."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's answering the door and..."
"Squidward"," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
"Patrick"," He's beating up Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," DoodleBoy, stop! "
"Patrick"," He's got the pencil."
"SpongeBob","  What have I done? We've got to find him!"
"SpongeBob"," Where could he possibly be?"
"Patrick"," Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, let's go! "
"Patrick"," I'm not going in there "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... "
"Patrick"," What just happened?"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!"
"Patrick"," Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?"
"SpongeBob"," No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. "
"SpongeBob"," See what I mean, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Where's the leak, ma'am?  Yurrgh! "
"SpongeBob"," You okay, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Finland!"
"SpongeBob"," There he is."
"Patrick"," He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!"
"SpongeBob"," Eh hem."
"Patrick","  Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh."
"SpongeBob"," He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!"
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Patrick! Do something!"
"Patrick","  Happy birthday!"
"Patrick","  Here's your present.  You're welcome."
"SpongeBob"," Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, what was that?"
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...  I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!"
"Patrick"," Take it easy. It's just a drawing."
"SpongeBob","  Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Done and done."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, goodnight, sweet prince."
"SpongeBob"," Goodnight, magic pencil.  Oh hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   DoodleBob!  No hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!"
"SpongeBob","  Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. "
"Squidward","  Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!"
"SpongeBob"," Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?"
"SpongeBob"," Take a look for yourself, Patrick."
"Patrick","  It's the evil doodle!"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose."
"Patrick"," So... he's a drawing?"
"SpongeBob"," Exactly! See how happy he is?"
"Patrick","  He still looks kind of creepy."
"SpongeBob"," O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Ready! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? "
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, am I!"
"SpongeBob"," Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves."
"Patrick"," First, I have to put away my secret box."
"SpongeBob"," Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! "
"Patrick"," Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! "
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets."
"Patrick"," You do?"
"SpongeBob"," I've got a gazillion secrets!"
"Patrick"," Like what?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. "
"SpongeBob"," You wanna hear one of my secrets?"
"Patrick"," Do I?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend? "
"Patrick"," No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive."
"Patrick"," Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word ""fancy"" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear right now. "
"Patrick"," Gasp. I never would have guessed."
"SpongeBob"," Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?"
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uhh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna…  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick, I must know the secret!"
"Patrick"," For the last time, SpongeBob, no!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick, just a peek?"
"Patrick"," Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!"
"SpongeBob"," But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!"
"Patrick"," Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. "
"SpongeBob"," So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?"
"Patrick"," Friends. "
"SpongeBob"," What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victim's severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! "
"Patrick","  Seee... cret."
"SpongeBob","  I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. "
"Patrick"," Duh... who's there? "
"SpongeBob","  Shhh! "
"Patrick"," Eh?!  Who's that?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie. "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. "
"Patrick"," Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh…"
"Patrick"," It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! It's me, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me."
"SpongeBob"," No, really, Patrick! Look! "
"Patrick"," Our friendship ring! It is you!  How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?"
"SpongeBob"," If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. "
"Patrick","  That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!"
"SpongeBob","  Really?"
"Patrick"," Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to."
"SpongeBob"," OK! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?"
"Patrick"," Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?"
"SpongeBob"," It's just a string."
"Patrick"," A secret string!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!"
"Patrick"," Good night, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!"
"Patrick","  Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the...  ...secret compartment of my secret box...  ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party!  Merry Christmas, SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the "
"Squidward"," Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!"
"Squidward"," Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?"
"Squidward"," The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!"
"Squidward"," Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh..."
"Squidward"," Hold it! It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!"
"Squidward"," I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor. "
"Sandy"," Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?"
"Plankton"," Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not to mention free refreshments."
"Squidward"," Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor."
"Squidward"," People, people, settle down! Ok, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?"
"Plankton"," Do instruments of torture count?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Is mayonnaise an instrument?"
"Squidward"," No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.  Horseradish is not an instrument, either.  That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you."
"Mr. Krabs"," So when do we get the free food?"
"Squidward"," Ok, try to repeat after me.  Brass section, go.  Good. Now the wind.  And the drums.  Too bad that didn't kill me.  Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five."
"SpongeBob"," Is this the part where we start kicking?"
"Squidward"," No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line."
"Patrick"," Kicking? I wanna do some kicking! "
"Sandy"," Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...! "
"Patrick","   Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on."
"Squidward"," Okay, that's perfect everybody. Bubble Bowl here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers let's move! C'mon, move!"
"Squidward"," How's that harmonica solo coming Plankton?"
"Plankton"," It's tremendous, you wanna see?"
"Squidward"," Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began...  ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?"
"Plankton","  Correct!"
"Squidward"," So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four!  OK, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us."
"Mr. Krabs"," What did you say, punk?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates!"
"SpongeBob","  No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off."
"Squidward"," Wait, wait. I know tensions are high...  There's a deposit on that equipment, people!  Settle down, please!"
"Squidward"," Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness... and crushed it! Crushed it into little, tiny, bite-size pieces. I really had expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks.  Thanks for nothing!"
"Patrick"," You're welcome."
"SpongeBob"," What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?"
"SpongeBob"," And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?"
"SpongeBob"," Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band."
"SpongeBob"," Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo."
"Squidward"," I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that...  ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam!  What are you doing here?!"
"Squidward"," Uh, they couldn't come. They... died."
"Squidward","  That would be my band!"
"SpongeBob"," We're ready to perform, Squidward."
"Squidward"," That's his... eager face."
"Squidward","  I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town."
"SpongeBob"," That's the spirit, Squidward!"
"Patrick"," These are some ugly looking fish."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps."
"Mr. Krabs"," I think I'm gonna be sick."
"Squidward","  Alright, everybody.  Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4..."
"SpongeBob","   ♪The winner takes all, it's the thrill of one more kill. The last one to fall will never sacrifice their will. Don't ever look back on the world closin' in.

"Squidward","  Now! 800! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is  Clarinet.  What?"
"Squidward","  Read the sign."
"Squidward"," No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life."
"Mr. Krabs","  Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward,  welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day."
"Squidward"," What!? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Now we never have to stop working!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs.."
"Mr. Krabs"," See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this great Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Good! 'Cause we've got customers!"
"Squidward","  Here. Please hit me as hard as you can."
"SpongeBob"," Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!"
"Squidward","  Don't hold back."
"SpongeBob","  Hey Squidward. Guess what, I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!"
"Squidward"," Will you please?! Here,  give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!"
"SpongeBob"," All right!  Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night.  You mean outside?"
"Squidward"," That's where the dumpster is, yes."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there."
"Squidward"," But I thought you liked the night shift."
"SpongeBob"," You're right!  For the Krusty Krab!  Piece of cake!"
"Squidward"," So you're not afraid?"
"SpongeBob"," Pfft, nah."
"Squidward"," Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know."
"SpongeBob","  What? What do I know?"
"Squidward"," You don't remember? It was all over the news."
"SpongeBob"," Tell me! Tell me!"
"Squidward"," No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. "
"SpongeBob","  What happened, what happened, what happened!?"
"Squidward"," You mean you've never heard the story of the  ""Hash-Slinging Slasher?"""
"SpongeBob"," The Slash-Bringing Hasher?"
"Squidward"," The Hash-Slinging Slasher!"
"SpongeBob"," The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa."
"Squidward"," Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha  because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!"
"SpongeBob","  Tell me the story!"
"Squidward"," Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened."
"SpongeBob"," He forgot the secret sauce?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," He didn't wash his hands?"
"Squidward"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Irregular portions?"
"Squidward"," NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake."
"SpongeBob"," You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or..."
"Squidward","  Except he wasn't a sponge!"
"SpongeBob","  So?"
"Squidward"," So it didn't grow back!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, no! "
"Squidward"," And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Tuesday."
"Squidward"," Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance."
"SpongeBob","  But tonight's Tuesday night!"
"Squidward"," Then he'll be coming."
"SpongeBob"," How will we know?"
"Squidward"," There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next..."
"Squidward"," Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand.."
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Squidward"," He opens the door  He slowly approaches the counter  ...and you know what he does next?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," You really want to know?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Are you sure you want to know?"
"SpongeBob"," What, what, what does he do?!"
"Squidward","  He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SpongeBob, I was joking!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," It's not true! None of it's true!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not?"
"Squidward"," Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke."
"SpongeBob"," Ohhhhh.  "
"SpongeBob","  Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day."
"Squidward","  Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?"
"Patrick","  Oh boy! Three A.M.! "
"Squidward"," Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," ""And the lights will flicker on and off."" Just like the story. I get it. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?"
"Squidward"," I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?"
"SpongeBob","  Nice try, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Nice try, what?"
"SpongeBob"," ""The phone will ring and there will be no one there.""  Oh, you crack me up."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  and the walls will ooze green slime!  No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? "
"SpongeBob","  I didn't know the buses ran this late. "
"Squidward"," They don't! "
"SpongeBob"," Well they're dropping someone off. "
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging..."
"SpongeBob"," The Hash-Slinging Slasher! "
"Squidward"," At last you understand! We're doomed!"
"SpongeBob"," No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!? "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you have references?"
"Squidward"," Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Da da dee.  Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo.  Da day dee da. Dee doh..  What's that smell?  The register!  $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short!"
"Squidward","  Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us."
"SpongeBob"," It's just a penny, sir.  It doesn't matter."
"Mr. Krabs"," Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your  pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!"
"Squidward"," Lilac!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that...  Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie."
"SpongeBob"," I see her, Mr. Krabs.  A Krabby Patty with cheese.  The classic."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich."
"SpongeBob","  Hey!  that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then what happened to Mr. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," She doesn't like to talk about it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on,  Mr. Krabs! You look great.  You wait here while I go break the ice."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," We're not driving."
"SpongeBob"," I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't move!"
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff,  I'd like to introduce you to Mr...  Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello.  No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello."
"Mr. Krabs","  No!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait.  He's trying to tell you something."
"SpongeBob","  Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to...  hit you with a rake!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Try to guess your weight."
"SpongeBob","  No, wait. He wants to take you..."
"SpongeBob"," ...on a date!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye. What do you say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I still got it."
"SpongeBob","  Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!"
"SpongeBob","  Breath spray?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Check."
"SpongeBob"," Lucky hanky?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Check."
"SpongeBob"," Giant rusty anchor?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!"
"SpongeBob"," Relax, Mr. Krabs.  Just a little joke.  Good luck with you know who."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib."
"Mr. Krabs","  What?  $100?!  Well, this can't possibly be correct!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you going to do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!"
"SpongeBob","  I wish there was some way I could help."
"Mr. Krabs"," Perhaps there is, boy!  I'm puttin' you in charge of me money."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money.  Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now, give me a dollar."
"SpongeBob"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good boy! You'll do fine."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's me,  my beautiful bell buoy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!"
"SpongeBob"," But you said..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this...  ...or this...  ...we're talking about this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day."
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course, my beautiful Puff."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs,  I got the flowers you wanted me to buy."
"Mr. Krabs","  What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff."
"Mr. Krabs"," We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!"
"SpongeBob"," But you said..."
"Mr. Krabs","  For you, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mr. Krabs","  And here's a box of chocolates.  SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates! Hurry! Hurry!"
"SpongeBob","  I bought the biggest box they had!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?"
"SpongeBob","  Psst, Mr. Krabs,  we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I think she..."
"Mr. Krabs"," The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head."
"SpongeBob"," As your financial advisor, I suggest..."
"Mr. Krabs","  There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!"
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Today!  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll  shade ya! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, hurry!"
"SpongeBob","  One shady hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job, lad. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Didn't need to buy one?  You hear that, boy?  We didn't need to buy a hat.  Aren't you supposed saving me money!?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! "
"Mr. Krabs","  You're breaking me, boy!  She needs fine jewelry!  Not that fine!  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff..."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  ""Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!"" And then I'll say, ""But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!"" Then you'll say, ""We're not talking about this...""  ...""Or this""...  ...""we're talking about this!"" "
"Mr. Krabs"," But lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Please lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Ok, I, I'm going to get it, see?  Cheer up, Mr. Krabs! Here's that washing machine you wanted!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!"
"SpongeBob"," See?! You just did it again!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money.  Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think?  Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, OK."
"Mr. Krabs","  Aawww..."
"SpongeBob","  Did you hear that? We get an assignment!"
"SpongeBob","  Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I know!"
"SpongeBob"," OK Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is  the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink.  Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay.  OK, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Spotlight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go!  Gee, this is harder than I thought... "
"Patrick"," Come on, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day. Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license!  Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only-six o'clock!  Okay, here we go, here we go.  Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics?  I can feel those juices pumpin' now!  Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper!  Come on pencil, make words."
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Hey hey hey Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean you're not hungry?"
"SpongeBob"," I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary.  I've got to make sure you have your nutrition Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite.  Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some creme brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits?  Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen.  Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage.  Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10 o'clock! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Ok, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!  I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now lets see how it looks so far. ""The-""  Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think SpongeBob think! "
"Patrick"," Who is that?  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?"
"Patrick"," Sleeping."
"SpongeBob"," That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay."
"SpongeBob","  That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!"
"Patrick"," Well, I'm listening."
"SpongeBob"," Uh...Marco!"
"Patrick"," Polo. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write?  Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy?  I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space.  So long Pesky Particles!  I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water!  That was a close one."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean 'overly dramatic?' Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry."
"SpongeBob"," I can't write on an empty stomach Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese  A visitor? For me!?  Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?"
"SpongeBob"," Rye or pumpernickel? "
"SpongeBob"," So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain..."
"SpongeBob","  How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh no! Midnight!  Must.. get... back to desk!  Whew, that was a close call.  Ah! My pants!"
"SpongeBob"," You get up here! I've got to get back to work!"
"SpongeBob","  Stop Pants! you get back here this instant! Paaants...! "
"SpongeBob","  Burning!"
"SpongeBob"," No!  What have I done?!  Help! Help! My house is on fire! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are!  I must have dozed off.  Lets see where are we?  Do I dare look at the clock..?  It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes?! How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight.  And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep...  Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is!  Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em."
"SpongeBob"," But what about my essay?"
"Patrick"," Need...furniture! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what's with the home improvement?  Hey, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Oooooooh, sweep sweep! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode."
"Patrick","  You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters.  ""Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!"""
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate."
"Patrick","  I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel."
"Patrick"," No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse."
"SpongeBob"," Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then?"
"Patrick"," Look! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, a note! "
"Patrick"," Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter! "
"SpongeBob"," You're right!"
"Patrick"," And, I got this message from my parents! "
"SpongeBob"," Your parents?  ""Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy."""
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers."
"SpongeBob"," No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this!  Nauuugh!"
"Patrick","  That always cheers me up.  But not today."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is."
"Patrick"," But don't they watch television?"
"SpongeBob"," That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are!"
"Patrick"," But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever!"
"Patrick"," Math is power!"
"Patrick"," A, B, C, D, E, F, G...  Oh! H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...!"
"Patrick"," W, X, Y and Z!  Hi Mom. Hi Dad."
"Patrick"," Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?"
"Patrick"," Well I know where it..."
"Patrick"," I'll go get the beverages. "
"Patrick","  Hooray, the idiot's here! I mean, I'll get it!"
"SpongeBob"," Protective helmet, check."
"SpongeBob"," I'm supposed to look stupid, Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," What could go wrong? "
"Patrick"," What a surprise!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi."
"Patrick"," Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi."
"SpongeBob"," Hi. "
"Patrick"," He means ""shake"".  No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands!  No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand.  Grab it with only one hand!  Good boy! Now move your arm up and down! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi."
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob. Show them your house!  No, not your blouse! Your house! "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner? "
"Patrick"," Only on Wednesday. "
"Patrick"," Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy. "
"Patrick"," Oh, that's nothing.  You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling ""I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!""  He drives all the neighbors crazy!  Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- . ---was really no help for him.  I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape! I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested,  but never box-chested!  Hey, SpongeBob do you have any mascara I could borrow? "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick! Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Aw, he said my name."
"Patrick"," Ow! He bit me!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation.  A dumb one!  So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing!  See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit?"
"Patrick"," Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really am dumb! "
"Patrick"," That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm only pretending to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!"
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act ""smart"" for everyone."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, I will! "
"Patrick","  And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!"
"SpongeBob","  I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy."
"Patrick","  It wasn't easy, dad."
"SpongeBob","  But... but, but, but, but, but, but..."
"SpongeBob"," Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See, here's a picture of it! "
"Patrick"," That must be actual size. "
"SpongeBob"," No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch.  2 plus 2 equals 4."
"SpongeBob"," Noooo!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick","  Janet? Marty? Who are you people?!"
"Squidward"," Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying ""Where's Patrick?"" all day! It's driving me nuts!"
"Patrick"," Mom! Dad!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on there, SpongeBob!  Take that pile of filth out with you. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!"
"Squidward"," He means this filth, you loon! "
"SpongeBob","  Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm...dumpster writing! The voice of the people! ""Up with bubbles, down with air!""  ""Nematodes are people too!""  Ha, those Nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a ."
"SpongeBob"," Well, sometimes, but not... Recently."
"Patrick"," Hi, garbage man. Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?"
"Patrick"," ""Krabs..."" Uh, isn't that the red sweaty guy you work for?"
"SpongeBob","  Nah-uh, not that word, that word."
"Patrick"," Hmm... ! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers."
"SpongeBob"," Sentence enhancers?"
"Patrick"," You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?"
"Patrick"," Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!"
"SpongeBob"," How  right you are, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation."
"Patrick"," Oh, mine too!"
"SpongeBob"," It tingles when I laugh!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?"
"Patrick","  Pretty  good, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.  And don't forget to ask us to  the  fries. It will be our  pleasure.  Hi Squidward, how the  are ya?"
"Patrick"," Nice  day, isn't it Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh?  The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?"
"Squidward"," Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what was it? What'd he say?"
"Squidward"," Er...he said...um, well he said..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!"
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers."
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's fancy talk."
"Mr. Krabs"," There ain't nothing fancy about that word!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean ?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, that one!  Now quit saying that!  It's a bad word!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use."
"Squidward"," Don't you mean there are only 7?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not if you're a sailor. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, 13."
"Patrick"," That's a lot of  bad words."
"Mr. Krabs"," OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing."
"SpongeBob"," Yea, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators."
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, my favorite! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! "
"Patrick"," Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel."
"SpongeBob"," Darn. "
"Patrick"," My turn!  Hooray! Escalators! Yay!  Up, up, up!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators!   Eels again."
"Patrick"," My turn!  Escalators!"
"SpongeBob"," Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!  Eels?"
"Patrick","  Es-skee-lators!  Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!"
"SpongeBob","  Escalators, escalators, escalators!!  Ha! Escalators! "
"Patrick"," Eels..."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, ! "
"Patrick"," Ooooh...! You said number 11!"
"SpongeBob","  I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!"
"Patrick"," Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand.  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob","  No wait, Patrick!  Patrick, no, please don't tell!"
"Patrick"," But, you said """"! "
"SpongeBob"," Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!"
"Patrick"," Not if I tell first!"
"SpongeBob"," I can run faster than you! "
"Patrick","  See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha!  Oh no!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What, what, what?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes, yes?"
"SpongeBob"," He said, he said, he said!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Out with it, boy!"
"SpongeBob","  Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things."
"Mr. Krabs","  What kind of things?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, he said..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?"
"Patrick","  Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," ...number thirteen..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash.  You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. "
"Patrick"," What's going to happen to us?"
"SpongeBob"," We'll probably get 40 lashes!"
"Patrick"," Oh, no! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that."
"Patrick"," I'm sorry too, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr.Krabs."
"Patrick","  Agreed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What   genius puts a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Five, six, seven..."
"Mr. Krabs"," ...a whole lotta  and with a side of , a heapin' helpin' of  and a boatload of  ..."
"Patrick"," Nine..."
"Mr. Krabs"," ! "
"SpongeBob","  That's all 13, Patrick!!  We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!"
"SpongeBob"," Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice ! And he----Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you?  You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Mother!"
"Squidward"," Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!"
"Squidward"," Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer.  Welcome to art class!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding."
"SpongeBob","  This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?"
"Squidward"," You're looking at him."
"SpongeBob"," You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven."
"Squidward"," Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles."
"Squidward"," So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, please."
"Squidward"," Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. OK. First, repeat after me I have no talent."
"SpongeBob"," I have no talent."
"Squidward"," Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
"Squidward"," If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me."
"SpongeBob"," If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. "
"Squidward"," Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one.  Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," How's this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process."
"SpongeBob"," Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy."
"Squidward"," Gimme that.  Forget the circles."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom."
"Squidward"," Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog!  What are you doing, now?"
"SpongeBob"," I call it Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time. "
"Squidward"," Do you want to learn art, or not?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen."
"Squidward"," Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And... "
"SpongeBob","  How's this Squidward?"
"Squidward","  It's beautiful!  I mean... this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art."
"SpongeBob"," Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors! "
"SpongeBob"," But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!"
"Squidward"," Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late."
"Squidward"," The world famous art collector?"
"Squidward"," Well, what are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one ""Squidward en repose""."
"Squidward"," Why not?"
"Squidward"," How about this one? I call it Bold and Brash."
"Squidward"," Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh..."
"Squidward"," Fame. "
"Squidward"," Fortune. "
"Squidward"," Anything?  It's me. It's me. I'm responsible."
"Squidward"," I could use a little help.  My fame! My fortune! My hair!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off."
"Squidward"," Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye.  I gotta find SpongeBob!!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness."
"Squidward"," Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible."
"SpongeBob"," Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them. "
"Squidward"," Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward"," Really!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward"," Really!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward"," Really."
"SpongeBob"," Wow.  Really?"
"Squidward"," Let's go."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!"
"Squidward"," Gimme that.  Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before."
"SpongeBob"," I... can't!"
"Squidward"," Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again."
"SpongeBob"," I did it, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the..."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book."
"Squidward"," Uhh...  How about this, huh? Remember?"
"SpongeBob"," That's not in the book, either."
"Squidward"," Forget about the book!  Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob.  What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it.  Ta-da! "
"Squidward"," OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble."
"SpongeBob"," First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept."
"Squidward"," Now you've got it."
"SpongeBob"," I've gotta embrace the marble!"
"Squidward"," Right."
"SpongeBob"," I've gotta sniff the marble!"
"Squidward"," Well, uh, ok."
"SpongeBob"," I've gotta lick the marble!"
"Squidward"," Uhh..."
"SpongeBob","  I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within."
"Squidward"," Here you go, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," With this tool, I shall give birth to art."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy. "
"SpongeBob"," But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.   ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. ♪"
"Squidward"," As of now, it's his responsibility.  Good day to you, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you ""Twelvey.""  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name."
"SpongeBob","  Gotcha!  Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday I'll catch old No Name."
"SpongeBob"," I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You've got 5 minutes!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch!   Yum!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, this is a hole, sir. You see, I am a sponge, and..."
"SpongeBob"," It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly."
"SpongeBob"," Sure! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?"
"SpongeBob"," No-one Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers.  Here you go Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey."
"Mr. Krabs","  Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," You okay Mr. K?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it  ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish."
"SpongeBob"," But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers.  Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!"
"SpongeBob","  No! Never!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Then go out there and get me some more jellies!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! "
"SpongeBob","  Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm gonna need more than that, boy."
"SpongeBob","  More jellies, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, that'll never do. More!"
"Mr. Krabs","  More, SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What don't you understand about... more!"
"Mr. Krabs"," More!  More!  More!  More!  More...  More!  More, more, more, more! More, more! More! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!"
"SpongeBob"," It feels like somebody... wants to sell me something!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm not interested in anything you're selling!  I sure felt like...  I must be working too hard.  I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?"
"SpongeBob","  Wrong number.  I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill!  Gary, is that you? Gary?  Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen.  Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly.  Blue jelly!  Hey, old No Name? What's happening?"
"SpongeBob"," No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business?  Hey, I don't remember that factory!  Huh?  What is this horrible place? "
"SpongeBob"," What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?"
"Mr. Krabs","  That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do? "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! A tea party!  You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Easy boy, what are you doing with that?"
"SpongeBob","   Something that should've been done a long time ago!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Whew!"
"SpongeBob"," And now I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say ""open"". "
"SpongeBob"," Freedom! Freedom!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never catch me!  Blasted exercise craze! "
"SpongeBob","  Goodbye, friends!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm taking jelly off the menu. "
"SpongeBob"," He really got burned on that deal!  All is as it should be.  I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever!  Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... ""Friend."" "
"SpongeBob"," This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games."
"SpongeBob"," To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under...  …neath it!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games."
"Patrick"," Games? Can I play?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, sorry, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," You have to be a fry cook."
"Patrick"," Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean easy?"
"Patrick"," How hard can it be?"
"SpongeBob"," They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!"
"Patrick"," Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!"
"Patrick"," Tssss..."
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you go home Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!"
"Patrick"," Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails."
"SpongeBob"," You take that back!"
"Patrick"," Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't even have fingernails."
"Patrick"," I cannot believe what I am hearing!"
"SpongeBob"," How can you hear it? You don't have ears either!"
"Patrick"," Holes! Holes!"
"SpongeBob"," Cone head!"
"Patrick"," Yellow!"
"SpongeBob"," Pink!"
"Patrick"," I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!"
"SpongeBob"," Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...Pew! He's right."
"Plankton"," I love messing things up."
"Plankton"," Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Always ready, Plankton. Always ready."
"Plankton"," Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick......your carapace!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him! Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!"
"Plankton"," That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion.  Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!  Other way!  Imbeciles. And... stop! Perfect. Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium. "
"Plankton"," Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of...  ...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant......Patrick Star!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook."
"Patrick"," Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants."
"Patrick"," Check it out!"
"Patrick"," I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust."
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh. I'm eating my own dust!"
"SpongeBob"," Not if I eat it first!"
"Patrick"," Yellow!"
"SpongeBob"," Pink!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend."
"Mr. Krabs"," Friend? Not in here, he ain't."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean?"
"Plankton"," He's not really your friend."
"Patrick"," He's not?"
"Plankton"," He's plotting your downfall right now!"
"SpongeBob"," He is?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's gonna stab you in the back."
"Patrick"," He wouldn't!"
"Plankton"," Of course he would. Just look at him. Square the shape of evil!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Plankton"," Then get mean!"
"Patrick"," I'm mean!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get angry!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm angry!"
"Plankton"," Now get out there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And win..."
"Plankton"," That..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Medal!"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Win this one for the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," For the Krusty Krab!!! "
"Plankton"," Win this one because I told you to."
"Patrick"," Because you told me to! "
"SpongeBob"," Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," I scream for ice cream! "
"SpongeBob"," Top that, Pinky."
"Plankton"," Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!"
"Plankton"," Better than you!"
"Plankton"," Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!"
"Patrick"," Take that, yellow boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet."
"Patrick"," That's what you think, but it's not over yet."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't forget, he called ye yellow."
"Plankton"," Don't forget, he called you pink!"
"Patrick"," Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal."
"Patrick","  Noooo! My name's... not... Rick!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't like you!"
"Patrick"," I don't like you more!"
"SpongeBob"," I never liked you!"
"Patrick"," I a thousand times never liked you!"
"SpongeBob"," Pink!"
"Patrick"," Yellow!"
"SpongeBob"," Yellow?"
"Patrick"," Pink?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's promise never to fight again, buddy."
"Patrick"," Yeah, pal. Let's go home."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Where ya going?"
"Plankton"," Get back here and kill each other!"
"Patrick"," You're my best friend ever."
"SpongeBob"," You too, Patrick."
"Patrick"," You know, these were white when I bought 'em."
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profits will make me wallet fat!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!"
"Squidward"," Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's with all this ""change"" nonsense?"
"SpongeBob"," Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up!  Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe."
"Squidward"," You hardly pay us at all!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you."
"Squidward"," Ah, yes! Our meager restitution.  Ah, the sweet smell of payday.  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning.  Here's your check."
"Mr. Krabs"," And here's yours, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs.  Grilling is my passion!"
"Squidward"," What is this!?!  You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it."
"SpongeBob"," 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. "
"Squidward"," Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him."
"Squidward"," Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same."
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Squidward"," We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! You and me go on strike?"
"Squidward"," Sure! After all, you like your job, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Right!"
"Squidward"," And you want to keep working here, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Right!"
"Squidward"," And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Right!"
"Squidward"," Then let's go on strike!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! A strike!  ♪Goin' on a strike! Goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A strike?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean you're going to make picket signs?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," And you're going to make protest speeches?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And you're going to demand me respect?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!  Noo...  No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I...  Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too!  This is exactly why we need to go on strike.  He can't treat us like this anymore!  He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap.  Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!  Ahem."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry."
"Squidward"," Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time you'll have your job back and more."
"SpongeBob"," And more?"
"Squidward"," Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.  That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground."
"SpongeBob","  I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground."
"Squidward"," Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking."
"SpongeBob"," Like this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!"
"SpongeBob"," How's this?"
"Squidward"," ...No.  This is a picket sign Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. "
"SpongeBob"," How about this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, it's ""unfair,"" not ""funfair""!"
"SpongeBob"," At the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people."
"SpongeBob"," Yep!"
"SpongeBob"," Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?"
"Squidward"," Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker!  You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?"
"Squidward","  Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there."
"SpongeBob"," Like this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect.  Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!"
"Squidward"," The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward"," We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!"
"SpongeBob","  Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing."
"Squidward"," With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!"
"Squidward"," Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification."
"SpongeBob"," That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands."
"Mr. Krabs"," But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!"
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part?"
"Squidward"," Dismantle your oppressive establishment?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that too!"
"SpongeBob"," And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!"
"Squidward"," On strike with SpongeBob... forever?! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day.  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! "
"Mr. Krabs"," See what I mean?  Squidward, please! You gotta come back!"
"Squidward"," You'll give us anything we want?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms."
"Mr. Krabs"," I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action!  I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board!  I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business!  Squidward will be so proud!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations."
"Squidward"," I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!"
"Squidward"," S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?"
"SpongeBob"," I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Here it comes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!"
"SpongeBob"," Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!"
"SpongeBob","  Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!"
"Patrick"," That's horrible! "
"SpongeBob"," It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty! "
"Patrick"," We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! "
"Squidward"," That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed! "
"Patrick","  What's wrong with my idea?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! "
"Mr. Krabs","  In the back."
"Sandy","  I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if you're willing to pay! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! You'll never get a cent out of me!  Never! I'd rather let that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive!  Sorry."
"Sandy","  Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all.  Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone!  Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward!  I am gonna get back what's mine! "
"SpongeBob","  What? But Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm! "
"Sandy"," Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here.  Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms.  Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw! "
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, you don't know!"
"Sandy"," Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. "
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! Sandy!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you!  Now, what was that idea of yours? "
"Patrick"," PUSH! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, don't go!"
"Sandy"," Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink! "
"Sandy"," So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll get massacred! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different ""big""s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?"
"Sandy"," If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?"
"SpongeBob","  Um, I do?"
"Sandy"," You do? Where?"
"SpongeBob"," Um... in my pocket."
"Sandy"," Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on!  SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string."
"SpongeBob","  No, it's not. This is your tail."
"Sandy","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?"
"Sandy","  Well, I gotta admit, that's slowin' me down, but I'm still going for him! "
"SpongeBob","  You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!"
"Sandy"," You ain't my pa!"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!"
"Sandy"," Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!"
"SpongeBob","  No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? "
"SpongeBob"," You are."
"Sandy"," And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, ""K"" in karate? "
"SpongeBob","  You did."
"Sandy"," And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?"
"SpongeBob","  You do."
"Sandy"," Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch."
"SpongeBob"," Okay."
"Sandy"," Say it."
"SpongeBob"," There isn't anything..."
"Sandy"," Ain't nothin'!"
"SpongeBob","  Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but..."
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," You see..."
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," I... "
"Sandy","  Worm sign.  He's in that cave."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, are you sure you...?"
"Sandy"," Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew.  Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah!  I'm winnin', SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, that's not...! "
"Sandy"," This shouldn't take long. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, that's not...!"
"Sandy"," Almost done!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Yee-haw!  I got him, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Sandy...?"
"Sandy"," Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! "
"SpongeBob"," That's not the worm."
"Sandy","  Pardon?"
"SpongeBob"," That's not the worm. That's his tongue. "
"Sandy"," Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm.  Run for your life! "
"SpongeBob"," So what's the plan, Sandy? "
"Sandy"," Run faster!"
"SpongeBob"," I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!"
"Sandy"," Later!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?"
"Sandy"," Not now, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I wanna hear you say it!"
"Sandy"," Can we talk about this another time?"
"SpongeBob"," Say it!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Say it, or I'll trip you! "
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Say it!"
"Sandy"," Not now!"
"SpongeBob"," Say it!"
"Sandy"," All right! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?"
"SpongeBob","  I knew it. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," What do we do now?"
"Sandy","  I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for ""SpongeBob"" or S for ""Sandy""! That way they can identify our bodies."
"Sandy"," No, silly! How about S for ""save our skins""?  Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here.  We did it!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! He'll never get out of there!"
"Sandy"," We saved the town!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! Let's go tell everybody! "
"Patrick"," Push!  Push! "
"Plankton","  Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!"
"Plankton"," Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good!  D'oh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, ooh, sweet wampum. Huh! Whazzat?  Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead!  So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my arch competitor, Plankton!  For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man.  So long, shrimp! "
"Plankton"," Curse you, Mr. Krabs!  Ouch! "
"Plankton"," Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub? "
"Plankton"," What do we got here?  Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's a big as a whale. I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like. "
"Plankton"," What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae!  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mister Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!"
"SpongeBob"," Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties."
"Plankton","  At last!"
"SpongeBob","  There you are sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton."
"Plankton"," Er, um, hey there, uh SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir!"
"Plankton"," I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection."
"SpongeBob"," I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Why- why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!"
"Plankton"," The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his—  I mean uh, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer."
"SpongeBob","  But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!"
"Plankton"," Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!"
"Plankton"," Review?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yes, please sir, please!"
"Plankton"," But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!"
"Plankton"," Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work. "
"SpongeBob"," But sir!"
"Plankton"," I thought I sent you away, Cretin!"
"SpongeBob"," But sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!"
"Plankton"," All right, the sauce."
"SpongeBob","  Wh-what?"
"Plankton"," The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over."
"SpongeBob","  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Plankton"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Plankton"," What's the matter with you? All I said was ""A little too much sauce."" It's no big deal, really."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Plankton"," What do you want from me, a promotion?"
"SpongeBob","  A pro- a promo- a promotion?!"
"Plankton"," Uh, sure kid, you're uh... you're on register now."
"SpongeBob","  Register! "
"Plankton"," Glad that's over. "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!"
"Squidward","  Co-Cashier?!"
"Plankton","  So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?"
"Squidward","  You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to... "
"SpongeBob"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... "
"Squidward"," Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!"
"Plankton"," So what do you want me to do about it?"
"Squidward"," I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean."
"Plankton","  Hope you like gray. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, I can see you through this little window!"
"Plankton","  Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—"
"Plankton"," Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!"
"Plankton"," If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy."
"Plankton"," Ow!"
"Plankton"," Me?"
"Plankton"," In a cosmic sort of way, yes."
"Plankton"," What? It's just an ordinary Krabby—  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did."
"Plankton"," Oh, what now?"
"SpongeBob"," A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name! "
"Plankton"," I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?"
"Plankton"," Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?"
"SpongeBob"," No sir, he's back."
"Plankton"," Who's back? What?  What was that?"
"SpongeBob","  Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover! "
"Plankton","  Take cover from what?!"
"SpongeBob","  He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!"
"Plankton"," What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!"
"SpongeBob"," He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!"
"Plankton"," Krabs? What the barnacle is going on here?"
"SpongeBob"," It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant."
"Plankton"," That's terrible!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but the worst part is..."
"Plankton","  Good grief, he's naked! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes, no service! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty! "
"Plankton","  I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?"
"SpongeBob"," Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, but I will. Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
"SpongeBob","  Phone call, Mr. Plankton."
"Mr. Krabs","  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
"Plankton","  It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy.  Holographic meatloaf? My favorite! "
"SpongeBob"," What a beautiful day."
"Patrick"," You said it, pal."
"SpongeBob"," Can you believe that sun? "
"Patrick"," I could look at it all day. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick? "
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing."
"Patrick"," So, how's that tan coming?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?"
"Patrick"," Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard. "
"SpongeBob"," What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool."
"Patrick"," Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies! "
"Patrick"," I'm going to the snack bar. "
"SpongeBob"," Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  AND LIVE! "
"SpongeBob"," Lifeguard?"
"SpongeBob","  White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?"
"SpongeBob"," You really think so?"
"SpongeBob","  I'd love it! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi. "
"SpongeBob"," It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry."
"SpongeBob"," By myself?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie."
"Squidward"," There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. "
"SpongeBob"," Wey, wook. It's Widward!"
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Widward's woing to work."
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?"
"Squidward"," What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?"
"SpongeBob"," We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club."
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!"
"Squidward"," Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!"
"Patrick","  What did he say?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know. Something about his nose?"
"Patrick","  Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!"
"Squidward"," Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!"
"Squidward"," Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!"
"Patrick"," That's what we've been trying to tell you!"
"SpongeBob"," We've been stuck up here for three days."
"Patrick"," We told you you wouldn't fit in."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Ready!"
"Squidward"," Shut your half-wit pieholes!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! "
"Squidward"," Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!"
"Patrick"," What happened?"
"Squidward"," Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"Squidward"," Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse."
"Patrick"," Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose."
"Squidward"," Well... this is the end. "
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not, Squidward."
"Patrick","  It's not?"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!"
"SpongeBob"," And besides, we have this! "
"Squidward"," What's that?"
"Patrick"," Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!"
"SpongeBob"," Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? "
"Squidward"," You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything."
"Patrick"," The shell knows all!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?"
"Patrick"," The shell has spoken!"
"Squidward"," Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!"
"Squidward","  I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!"
"Squidward","  All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh?  I'm free! Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick!  Huh? Ohhh...  there's no way out of here.  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing! As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky!  Fall right out of the sky! "
"Squidward"," Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there."
"SpongeBob"," It's a gift from the Magic Conch."
"Squidward"," Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...  "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Umm...uh..yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," Once a member, always a member!"
"Squidward"," Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?"
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization."
"Patrick","  Maybe he's not a brother."
"Squidward","  Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?"
"Squidward"," Oh. Then how about the soup?"
"Squidward"," Could I have anything to eat?"
"Squidward"," No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!"
"Patrick","  Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?"
"Patrick"," Hmm... Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?"
"Patrick"," All right!  Sorry, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Give me that!  Could I have something to eat?"
"Squidward"," Could I have something to eat?"
"Squidward"," Could I have something to eat?"
"Squidward"," Can't you say anything else but no?"
"Squidward","  Can I have something to eat?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, are you all right?"
"Patrick"," Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay."
"Squidward","  I'm saved!  You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!"
"Squidward","  Abra."
"Squidward"," All hail the magic conch! "
"Patrick"," It's spring!"
"SpongeBob","  I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?"
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Have you said hello to the flowers yet?"
"Squidward","  Good morning, flowers. "
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you. "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Hi Patrick!  How does this keep happening?  Hi.  She's beautiful!  What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish?  Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie.  She must have spotted my floral bookmark!  She's coming this way. That's it girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all.  Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever?  I'll take that as a yes!"
"Squidward","  What the...?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see!"
"Squidward"," Don't say anything Squidward, remember your karma. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What's with all the ruckus?  A monster scaring away me customers!"
"SpongeBob"," That's not a monster Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're a mystery, SpongeBob.  Get rid of it."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's either you or Mystery."
"SpongeBob"," I knew I should've named her Debbie. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!"
"SpongeBob","  You're welcome, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward. "
"SpongeBob"," Good one, sir.  Ha, it worked, girl!  We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build.  Only eight more hours. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job.  I bet you're hungry. How about some lunch?  Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  What was that? Is that horse in here?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! "
"SpongeBob"," That was close.  From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where's my order?"
"SpongeBob"," Did you look under the tray?"
"Squidward"," No I didn't, sorry.  SpongeBob, could you just get my order?"
"SpongeBob"," They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"Squidward"," In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, you cook the food, the customer gets the food.  We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. "
"Squidward"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control!  Now then, you were saying?"
"Squidward"," Just get my order. "
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squidward?  Ghosts.  Mystery, you ate my hat!  Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!"
"Squidward","  Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen."
"Squidward"," Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, what's going on in here?"
"Squidward"," Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H. Jones! "
"SpongeBob"," Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda. "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend! "
"Squidward"," Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend."
"SpongeBob","  You do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together."
"SpongeBob"," What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda!  My best friend ! "
"Squidward"," What? Would you get out of here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The point is, sometimes you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore?  Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat."
"Squidward"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get that horse! "
"SpongeBob"," Mystery!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come back!"
"SpongeBob"," Mystery! Weesnaw!"
"Squidward","  Here you go, sir. A King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works, double batter fried  on a stick."
"Squidward"," Barnaclehead. "
"Squidward","  You forgot your mayonnaise. "
"Squidward"," Look at them eating that garbage.  It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Good what?"
"SpongeBob"," Like you don't know.  Saying,  ""I hate Krabby Patties.""  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties."
"Squidward"," Yeah, well, not me."
"SpongeBob","  You're good at that.  Hey everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha! "
"Squidward"," Don't encourage them! They'll never leave."
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say. "
"Squidward"," That's me. Never had one, never will. "
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob","  What? What did you say?"
"Squidward"," I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry... I don't..."
"Squidward"," I've never had a Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?"
"Squidward"," I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this."
"Squidward","  Get that garbage outta my face! "
"SpongeBob"," If you try it, you'll love it!"
"Squidward"," Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick. "
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, Patrick.  Come on, you're gonna—"
"Squidward","  No."
"SpongeBob"," Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... "
"Squidward"," No!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoop! What's that in your ear? "
"Squidward"," Quit it."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, open wide!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first...  and not just the extra ones. "
"SpongeBob"," But it's good for you!"
"Squidward","  G—good for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul. "
"Squidward"," Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, just half."
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," A quarter?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," One bite?"
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Just smell it."
"Squidward"," If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward."
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," One bite."
"Squidward"," No... "
"SpongeBob"," You won't be sorry."
"Squidward","  No! "
"SpongeBob"," It's delicious..."
"Squidward"," Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?  Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral.  Ohh... do I really..."
"SpongeBob"," Ahhhhh...  Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh... "
"Squidward"," Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most...  Horrible! Putrid! Poorly prepared! Vile!  Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!"
"SpongeBob"," But—"
"Squidward","  And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved grave!  Get it?"
"SpongeBob"," But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms."
"Squidward"," Nobody but me."
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure?"
"Squidward"," Does this look unsure to you? "
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Squidward"," Good! Now go spread the word!"
"Squidward","  Come on! Come on! Come on!  Ah... still alive!  Oh, soooo delicious!  Oh...! All the wasted years...!  I gotta have more. I gotta have more!  But wait!  After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for good!"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties. "
"Squidward"," Uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with— with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?"
"SpongeBob"," Coming right up!  Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy.  But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things. "
"Squidward"," Don't go..."
"SpongeBob"," ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it.  You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left."
"Squidward"," Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back."
"SpongeBob"," Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work! "
"Squidward"," What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage? "
"Squidward"," I had to say garbage... but, okay! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated!  I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. , having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. Dream sequence ends]"
"Squidward"," Hmm, honey...  What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me!  There it is!   There it is, unguarded! All I have to do is... Wait... It's too easy. There must be some kind of...  security?  This is our burglar alarm? A bucket of water? Ha-ha.  That was too easy.  Hey, this isn't water, this is...gas! "
"Squidward"," Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start.  All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody..."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?  Is that you?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here? "
"SpongeBob"," I always come to work at 3am. This is when I count the sesame seeds.  What are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," Uhh, I forgot my..."
"SpongeBob"," And why is the patty vault open?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I thought that..."
"SpongeBob"," And why are you holding a patty behind your back?"
"Squidward"," I... I... I... no, I didn't do..."
"SpongeBob"," And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... "
"Squidward"," No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you...  You better listen to me, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I love Krabby Patties! "
"SpongeBob"," I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty!  Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward!  Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward! "
"Squidward"," What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?"
"SpongeBob"," No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs!"
"Squidward"," My thighs? "
"SpongeBob"," ...and then you'll blow up! "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, miss?"
"SpongeBob","  I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or..."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad,  just in case I have to write an essay."
"SpongeBob","  Hi, I'm SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  That joke was almost funnier the second time."
"SpongeBob","  That time it almost seemed like...  ...you really did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," Can I be excused for the rest of my life? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One, two, oh no, that's three! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. "
"SpongeBob"," Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! "
"SpongeBob"," Really? What's it say?"
"SpongeBob"," ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.  Death row, next in line speaking."
"Patrick","  Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Is that you? "
"Patrick"," Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double- "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!"
"Patrick","  You're working at Pizza Castle now?"
"SpongeBob"," What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up."
"Patrick","  No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you there?"
"Patrick","  Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle? "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't tell you."
"SpongeBob"," I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that."
"SpongeBob"," Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us."
"SpongeBob"," Flats says he's going to kick my butt!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," You what?!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. "
"SpongeBob","  Out of my way! Out of my way!  Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! ""BobPants SpongeSquare"". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Flats, you feeling better?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure."
"SpongeBob","  He's still gonna kick my butt! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it?  Flats!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is. "
"SpongeBob"," Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. "
"SpongeBob"," Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles.  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe."
"Mr. Krabs"," You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. "
"SpongeBob"," What can I get for you...handsome?"
"Mr. Krabs","  We're doomed."
"SpongeBob","  Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!  The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! "
"SpongeBob"," Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. "
"SpongeBob"," The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Fresh Sludge Pudding? "
"SpongeBob"," More Diet Red Tide? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Some Fried Flotsam? "
"SpongeBob"," And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?"
"SpongeBob","  He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Free food?!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor."
"Mr. Krabs"," You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!"
"SpongeBob"," Duped!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Bamboozled!"
"SpongeBob"," We've been smeckledorfed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underpants."
"SpongeBob"," I bet he bites whale bubbles."
"Mr. Krabs"," I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!"
"SpongeBob"," It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish the gnarliest stuff in the ocean."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office! "
"SpongeBob"," Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!  Why that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! "
"SpongeBob"," I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. "
"SpongeBob","  Here you go sir, enjoy. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face. "
"SpongeBob"," Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it."
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't think he'll be laughin', boy."
"SpongeBob"," Why, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because that patty killed him! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this ""we"" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!"
"SpongeBob"," But you told me to give it to him!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you could've talked me out of it!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get a hold of yourself, boy. We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," This should be far enough. Now get diggin'! "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the holdup down there?"
"SpongeBob"," There's a big rock in the way!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well toss it out and get back to diggin'!"
"SpongeBob","  Aye aye, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Somethin' ain't quite right."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," His head's stickin' out! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air."
"Mr. Krabs"," They don't need air where he's going."
"SpongeBob"," Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh..."
"SpongeBob","  What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why? Why? Why?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me, and worst of all, it'll be the end of me."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! "
"Mr. Krabs"," And what would be the charges?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Laugh, boy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool. Understand. "
"SpongeBob"," Can I lose my cool now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why?  Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Neptune, get away!  Ahem. Ok, all set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All set! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, he gets carsick real easy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo..."
"Mr. Krabs","  ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked. What am I gonna do? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I thought you were out back taking care of that shovel! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okey dokey, SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Funny? Oh, yeah!  He's a real cutup, that one. He knows how to keep the growing stages! Good one, boy! Always on, that one, there's no off on his funny switch!  Oh, look, I almost forgot, it's 'Open Cash Register' night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want? You want ice? Is that what you want? "
"SpongeBob"," The dark deed you requested is done, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!"
"SpongeBob"," What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He was insane! Out of control! He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along."
"SpongeBob"," It was all Mr. Krabs' idea."
"Mr. Krabs"," Put him down now! He's a mad dog!"
"SpongeBob"," He wears curlers to bed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! It's not what you think!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We killed the health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's empty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah...a joke! "
"SpongeBob","  It's the zombie! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really."
"SpongeBob"," See anything yet, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I need my glasses.  Hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck!"
"Squidward"," I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day."
"SpongeBob"," That's me! "
"Squidward"," That's a big box!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?"
"SpongeBob"," 30 more seconds, Patrick. "
"Squidward"," They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  Huh? A brand-new television?"
"SpongeBob"," Easy... easy... "
"Squidward"," Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?"
"SpongeBob","  Pretty smart, huh?"
"Patrick","  I thought it wouldn't work."
"Squidward"," Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!"
"Squidward"," Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?"
"SpongeBob"," With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!"
"Patrick"," A starfish!"
"Squidward"," Patrick, you're already a starfish."
"Patrick"," See, Squidward? It works! You try!"
"Squidward","  Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!"
"Patrick"," Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's go for it!  Gloves!"
"Patrick"," Check."
"SpongeBob"," Hats!"
"Patrick"," Check."
"SpongeBob"," Underwear!"
"Patrick"," Uh... check!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope."
"Patrick"," You got it! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!"
"Squidward"," I hope they put some air holes in that box. "
"SpongeBob"," Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!"
"Patrick"," I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!"
"Squidward","  Now where's that remote? "
"Patrick"," I am the lizard king! Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!"
"Patrick"," What should we keep down?"
"Squidward"," Morons."
"SpongeBob"," Our voices!"
"Squidward"," Will you two shut up?!  Sponge... Bob? "
"Patrick"," Hold me."
"SpongeBob"," Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, I can't do that!"
"Patrick"," Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Because I already cut off my own arms! "
"Patrick"," Nooooo!"
"Squidward","  What the? How were you two making that noise?"
"SpongeBob","  What noise, Squidward?"
"Patrick"," I could only hear the sound of our laughter."
"Squidward"," Yes! But those sound effects the avalanche, the, the, the..."
"Patrick"," Don't forget the second avalanche."
"Squidward"," Forget it.  I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. "
"Squidward"," Grrrr... Aha!  How are you two doing that?"
"SpongeBob"," First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet..."
"Squidward"," The noises! How are you two making those noises?"
"Patrick"," That's easy. All you need is a box."
"SpongeBob"," And...  ...imagination."
"Squidward","  Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies."
"Patrick"," That's good. Now all you need is a box. "
"Squidward","  I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet? "
"Squidward"," What do they want with me? What did I do?  Obviously, I've violated some new box kicking law!  Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!"
"Patrick","  Whoopee! Another box! "
"Squidward"," I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. "
"Squidward","  Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?! "
"Squidward","  Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes.  I give up."
"Squidward","  How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's such a jerk. "
"Squidward"," Laugh at me, will they?  All right, where is it?"
"Patrick","  Here I am!"
"SpongeBob"," Where's what, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Don't ""Where's what, Squidward?"" me! Where's the tape recorder?"
"SpongeBob"," We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Don't ""We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!"" me!"
"SpongeBob"," But we don't!"
"Patrick","  We have a tape recorder box."
"Squidward","  All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. "
"SpongeBob"," Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S...  ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?"
"Squidward"," No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about...  ...imagination."
"Squidward"," All right, fine!  Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! "
"Patrick","  Beep-beep-beep."
"SpongeBob","  Arr."
"Patrick"," Beep-boop-bee-boop."
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy matey!"
"Patrick"," Beep-beep."
"SpongeBob"," For that you'll walk the plank! "
"Squidward","  Why won't this thing turn on?!  All right, fine. If you don't want to show me,  I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! "
"SpongeBob","  I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots."
"Patrick"," Yeah, see you in the morning."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Patrick. "
"Squidward","  Hello, what's this?  ""This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! "
"SpongeBob","  Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great."
"Squidward","  Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line!  I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there!  Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, our box is gone!"
"Patrick"," Oh, well."
"SpongeBob"," I know! Let's go see Squidward!"
"Patrick"," I hope he's not too down in the dumps today. "
"Squidward"," Can I help you?"
"Squidward"," Whatever. Five dollars, please."
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward"," This is a restaurant, not a lending library. And who are you calling big nose, big nose? "
"Squidward","  I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
"SpongeBob","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph! "
"SpongeBob","  Autograph!"
"SpongeBob"," Can I have your autograph can I have your autograph can I... they're gone!  Mermaid Man's belt!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, guys! Wait up!  I've got something for you..."
"SpongeBob"," You forgot your belt! You forgot—  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt! The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands! Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not!  I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does!  Whoa!  The small ray! "
"Squidward"," Here's your shake, sir.  Grr."
"SpongeBob","  There you go. Come again, sir. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! What's going on in here? Huh?  Why's everything all tiny?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know."
"Squidward"," What do you got there?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing."
"Squidward"," No, really?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing."
"Squidward"," You've got something, alright! Let's see it! "
"SpongeBob"," No, no!"
"Squidward","  Is that Mermaid Man's belt?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Wow! I can't believe he'd lend it to you!"
"SpongeBob"," Me, uh... either. "
"Squidward","  He didn't lend it to you, did he?"
"SpongeBob"," Please don't tell!"
"Squidward","  You stole it!"
"SpongeBob"," Please don't tell!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm telling."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!"
"Squidward"," Uh-oh!  There's the phone!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't!"
"Squidward"," I'm walking towards the phone! "
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Squidward","  I'm getting closer to the phone!"
"SpongeBob","  Do-o-o-n't!"
"Squidward","  And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for."
"SpongeBob","  I'm begging you!"
"Squidward"," Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid...  What the? What?  Ow!"
"Squidward"," What did you do to me?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh... uh, okay, uh..."
"Squidward"," I said now!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh...  Uh..."
"Squidward"," Do you hear me?!  Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me!  Don't you know how to work that thing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I can do it! "
"Squidward","  Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--"
"SpongeBob","  No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I was at work and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. "
"Patrick"," A Squidward action figure!  Let me play with him!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Fighter pilot!  Dive bomb!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick","  And then comes a giant fist!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident."
"Patrick"," Oh...  And then comes a giant fist! "
"SpongeBob","  Pat, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life."
"Patrick"," Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day."
"SpongeBob"," You think so?"
"Patrick"," Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size.  Like this pickle! See? They like each other!"
"Squidward"," N-n-n-n-no. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!"
"Patrick"," Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," You got it set to  'M' for Mini when it should be set to  'W' for Wumbo."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word."
"Patrick"," Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He she me... wumbo? Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward","  I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you."
"Patrick"," Well alright then. Let 'er rip!  It worked!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no!"
"Patrick"," Look, SpongeBob's giant!  Can I be giant next?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!"
"Patrick"," You're kidding!  Good thing I still got this pickle! "
"Squidward"," Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!"
"SpongeBob","  No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise.  Until then,  you'll be safe in this jar."
"Patrick"," You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh."
"SpongeBob"," It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. "
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! "
"Sandy","  What did you? For cryin' out. What did y'all do to me?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... "
"SpongeBob","  Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh Squidward, he'll be so disappointed."
"Sandy"," Well, you can't leave us small forever!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't understand! "
"SpongeBob"," Mom?"
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and..."
"Squidward"," Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home! "
"Sandy"," And I need an elevator to climb one stair! Hi-ya! "
"SpongeBob"," I've got it!  Ta-da!  Ta-da! Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! "
"Squidward"," I guess this is okay."
"Plankton"," Well, it's great to be back!  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!"
"SpongeBob"," Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! "
"SpongeBob","  This must be the night driving part of the test. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. "
"SpongeBob"," That depends, did I pass?"
"SpongeBob"," Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. "
"Patrick"," Well, it sounds like it's all your fault."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head!  Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail."
"Patrick"," How are we gonna do that? "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, put the money in the bag!  Put it in!"
"SpongeBob","  Alright, give me the money!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, savings."
"SpongeBob"," Sure.  Here ya go."
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that went better than expected."
"Patrick"," Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick, there she is!  Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob.  We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! "
"SpongeBob"," Darn it! Ok, Patrick, let's get out of here.  No, wait!  There goes our deposit on these costumes. "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's really me!  I brought Patrick along too."
"Patrick"," Hi."
"SpongeBob"," 'Cause we're gonna set you free!"
"SpongeBob"," He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. "
"SpongeBob","  That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I think she means it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's crazy, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," But why?"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff.  Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live in the outside world. To not be in prison. "
"SpongeBob"," We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom."
"SpongeBob"," Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!"
"SpongeBob"," Psst!  Hop in, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, up here."
"SpongeBob"," Made of sponge! "
"SpongeBob"," No! What are you doing? Help! Help!  No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoopee!"
"Plankton","  What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you! "
"Patrick"," Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this? "
"Patrick"," Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?"
"Patrick"," Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, first, you have to make a snowball."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, pal. "
"Patrick"," Thanks, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! How could you?"
"Patrick"," It's a snowball fight, remember?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah. "
"Squidward"," Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!"
"Patrick"," That's me!"
"SpongeBob"," I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!"
"Squidward"," Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down. "
"Patrick"," Huh?  Ha! You missed me! "
"SpongeBob"," Score one for the boys back home! "
"Squidward"," Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades. "
"Patrick","  I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better."
"Squidward"," Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?"
"Patrick","  Can I use your bathroom?"
"Squidward"," Patrick, go use your own bathroom."
"Patrick"," I don't think I can make it! Please?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Please?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Please?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Please!"
"Squidward"," Okay, make it quick."
"Patrick","  That's okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh... "
"Patrick"," Yay! Squidward's on my side!"
"Squidward"," I most certainly am not!"
"SpongeBob"," Then that means he's on my side!"
"Squidward"," No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it. "
"Patrick"," Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"Squidward"," Hmm... "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, it's out."
"Squidward","  Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be  knocking each other's brains out!"
"SpongeBob"," We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty."
"Squidward"," Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," And who am I?"
"Squidward"," You're Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Can I be Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward"," No! Wait, why?"
"SpongeBob"," He's a good leader."
"Squidward"," Would you butt out?!"
"Patrick"," Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! "
"Squidward","  Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now..."
"SpongeBob"," If you're in this war, then where's your fort?"
"Squidward"," I don't have one, okay? Now..."
"Patrick"," You got to have a fort, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Forts win wars, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Okay, fine! You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Disposable? Phooey. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Open for business.  See anything you like?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks."
"Mr. Krabs"," It was the queen of Switzerland."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker. "
"SpongeBob"," They taste even better.  Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Patrick"," What are you doing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?"
"Patrick"," That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday."
"Mr. Krabs","  That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh...  ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?"
"Patrick"," Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Five bucks."
"Patrick","  I only got seven."
"Mr. Krabs","  Deal."
"Patrick"," Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This hat says, ""Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking."" This hat was made for you, boy.  You were born to wear this hat."
"SpongeBob"," Ee-hee, ooh...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A perfect fit, eh son?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together!  How can I ever repay you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," With 10 dollars."
"SpongeBob","  All I have is 5."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I guess it's no deal."
"SpongeBob"," I'll be right back.  Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well-- I don't know... but, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't mention it, boys.  What a couple of rubes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, I am."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fresh out."
"Mr. Krabs","  Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-..."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl."
"SpongeBob"," Am I a pretty girl?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through.  Thanks Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not? "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not even a teensy-tiny bit?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag."
"SpongeBob"," What is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Novelty hats.  How about this air-condition one? "
"SpongeBob"," Seems a little dangerous. "
"Mr. Krabs"," The juicer. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?"
"SpongeBob"," No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though."
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this but he leaves me no other option. I'm gonna have to scare it off of him.  Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare him. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not a shopping list...  I'm a ghost!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  Now, listen, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," How do you know my name? Who are you?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I am the ghost of soda drink hats.  I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed."
"SpongeBob"," Cursed?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. It must belonged to some guy who's dead now."
"SpongeBob"," What guy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... Smitty something."
"SpongeBob"," Smitty what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen."
"SpongeBob"," He must've been number one."
"Mr. Krabs"," Number one in Bogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately."
"SpongeBob"," Immediately?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Immediately..."
"SpongeBob"," To its owner?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes..."
"SpongeBob"," Right now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen."
"Mr. Krabs","  What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery."
"Mr. Krabs"," How did? I just... You did... I did... Gimme that shovel. "
"SpongeBob"," It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Ahh!  Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  ""Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams."" What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. "
"SpongeBob"," Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, not that! "
"SpongeBob"," You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, no, no! "
"SpongeBob"," It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, right. You and what army?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards."
"Mr. Krabs"," No flipping way!  Back off! Back off, I say."
"Mr. Krabs"," Tallyho!  Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!  You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding.  Back to oblivion.  Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha!  Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars!  Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars. "
"SpongeBob"," Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's a spirit breaker. "
"Squidward","  What a baby."
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon, Mr. Doodles.  We haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy.  What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What in Neptune's name is going on?"
"Squidward"," We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary."
"Squidward"," This is all necessary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then what's all this useless junk? "
"Squidward"," That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, then how do you explain that?  A second Krusty Krab?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you got me there. But why do we need him? "
"Squidward"," This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, get lost, all of ya.  You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving.  Except you. You stay. "
"Squidward"," Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm down here, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward said I could help by burying myself!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit fooling and come on out.  I need you to be in the commercial."
"SpongeBob","  Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me! "
"Squidward"," But, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight."
"SpongeBob"," Tonight?! "
"Squidward"," Tonight?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot. "
"SpongeBob"," It's almost on, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history. "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Gary! It's on! "
"Squidward","  What's your problem, Amy? "
"Squidward","  Where's that coming from? "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous  Krabby Patty! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas. "
"SpongeBob"," There I am, Gary! There I am! "
"Mr. Krabs"," We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty. "
"Mr. Krabs"," How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls? "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Gary, there I am again. Look! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today. "
"SpongeBob"," That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed. "
"SpongeBob"," Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place. "
"SpongeBob"," Top of the morning, oldster. "
"SpongeBob"," You did? "
"SpongeBob"," You're right! Wow, he recognized me. "
"SpongeBob","  ""Weren't you that guy on TV?"" Yes! I am that guy.  How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please excuse me, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for...  Why, sir, I'm flattered. "
"SpongeBob","  You're on your way. "
"SpongeBob"," Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to? "
"SpongeBob"," F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him. "
"Squidward"," There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to... "
"SpongeBob"," No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy. "
"Squidward","  To my tailfin? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, I am that guy on TV. "
"SpongeBob"," Please, good people, no photos at work. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, maybe just one.  Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," There you are, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, pilot. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I need you to...  ...OW!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful. "
"SpongeBob","  Solo record! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful. "
"SpongeBob"," They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby. "
"Mr. Krabs"," The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What in blazes are you talking about? "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work. "
"SpongeBob","  I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion. "
"Squidward"," Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders? "
"SpongeBob"," Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast. "
"Squidward"," I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting. "
"SpongeBob"," No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment. "
"Squidward"," Enter-what? "
"SpongeBob"," How you doing, folks? "
"SpongeBob"," That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy. "
"Squidward"," Hey! "
"SpongeBob"," I'd like to call this little number ""Striped Sweater."" ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing that one... special... sweater...♪  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable. "
"Squidward"," Then why don't you back in the kitchen and grab some patties and give them what they came here for! "
"SpongeBob"," Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. "
"SpongeBob"," They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down 3 miles from a blood bank? A cab! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on. Wasted. "
"SpongeBob"," They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. "
"SpongeBob"," You like that? "
"SpongeBob","  It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy. "
"SpongeBob"," Ready for the grand finale? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this."
"Mr. Krabs","  51, 52, 53..."
"Squidward","  29, 30, 31..."
"SpongeBob","  1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3..."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, can we please go now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy."
"SpongeBob"," The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for."
"Squidward"," But that's not fair!"
"SpongeBob"," Clause 3b The provider reserves the right to be unfair."
"Squidward"," Teacher's pet."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's see...  ...5, 10, 25, blue, applesauce. Everything looks to be in order...except, , where is it?  Where is it?"
"Squidward"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," My dime! Me special dime! The first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck!"
"Squidward"," Well, I've never seen it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on top of a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies? "
"Squidward"," Of course I'm...what are you saying?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!"
"Squidward"," You're saying something!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day!"
"Squidward"," Are you accusing me of something?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities One, you stole it. Two, you stole it? Or three, you stole it!"
"Squidward","  I didn't take your precious dime!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Show me your tentacles."
"Squidward"," What?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I wanna see empty suction cups."
"Squidward","  Here! Here! Here! See 'em?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You, you can't do that to me! I'm your boss!  "
"Squidward"," Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit! "
"SpongeBob","  No!  Whew. "
"Squidward"," I'm out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you're making a big mistake!"
"Squidward"," Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles? "
"Squidward"," Being dead, or anything else!"
"SpongeBob"," I never knew you felt so strongly about it."
"Squidward"," Where have you been?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I can't stop you, but Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. "
"SpongeBob"," Cookies! "
"Squidward"," Can I have one--? "
"SpongeBob"," Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman."
"SpongeBob"," Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache."
"Squidward"," Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands!  Spare change? Spare change, ma'am?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Squidward, is that you?"
"Squidward"," Uh, I , uh... "
"SpongeBob"," It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," There ya go. So, where you living these days?"
"Squidward"," Yes?"
"Squidward"," Uh...no--where."
"SpongeBob"," That's great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," A spaceman?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," A football playing king in spa--"
"Squidward"," Don't you get it?  I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything!"
"SpongeBob","  Even your paintings?"
"Squidward"," Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them. "
"SpongeBob"," There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. "
"Squidward"," Okay, but just until I get a job. One day...two days tops."
"SpongeBob","  Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Goodnight, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you."
"Squidward"," And in bed, too? Aw, thanks SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I..."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. "
"Squidward"," It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. I'll try not to be a burden."
"SpongeBob"," It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, Winner?"
"Squidward"," No, no, no. You've already...well... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Goodnight, Gary."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water?  Thank you."
"SpongeBob"," Good night. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets? "
"SpongeBob"," Here you go."
"Squidward"," Thank you.  SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light! "
"SpongeBob"," Goodnight. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me."
"SpongeBob"," He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough."
"SpongeBob"," I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where's my lemonade?"
"SpongeBob"," Coming Squidward! "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!  And why aren't you in uniform?  It's about time you got here!"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Your Majesty."
"Squidward"," I can't drink that."
"SpongeBob"," Why not?"
"Squidward"," Are you blind? Just look at it. "
"SpongeBob","  What about it?"
"Squidward"," That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered."
"SpongeBob"," Fine, I'll just take it out. "
"Squidward"," No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, that's two things in this house that won't work."
"Squidward"," Then go fix them."
"SpongeBob","  Two things that won't work!"
"Squidward"," I've changed my mind. I want soup instead."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Don't move.  Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special. "
"Squidward"," Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay. How about this? "
"Squidward","  Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint!"
"SpongeBob","  Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did...at his job! "
"Squidward"," 4 o'clock. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around. "
"SpongeBob","  ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives!"
"Squidward"," This isn't my show.  SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got a better idea!  Why don't I call someone whose job it is to fix it?  You know why? Because when I want a job  done I get someone with a job  to do  that job !"
"Squidward","  What are you saying?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me? "
"SpongeBob"," You want your dime back?!  Take it! Now Squidward can come back right? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wrong.  That ain't me first dime."
"SpongeBob"," Then have some more dimes!  I've got plenty of 'em!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it!"
"SpongeBob","  Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house, driving me crazy!  AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?!  What's that?"
"Sandy"," Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'll be changing alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, are you ready?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi..."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah!  Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear."
"SpongeBob","  Great minds think alike, I suppose."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," I may be down, but I'm not out! "
"SpongeBob","  Hi-yah! Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Oh, I'm Sandy alright.  I'm very Sandy.  Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I get it. She's ""Sandy."" That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! "
"Sandy"," Back in Texas, we call ice cream ""frozen cow juice"". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah!  Thank you."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?"
"SpongeBob"," Ew. "
"Sandy"," Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, let's go in."
"Sandy"," How tough am I? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Sandy"," Got any more tattoos? "
"Sandy"," Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?"
"SpongeBob"," It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water..."
"SpongeBob"," Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes."
"SpongeBob"," Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?"
"SpongeBob"," Super Weenie Hut Jr's?"
"SpongeBob","  What weenies. Oh brother."
"SpongeBob"," What? But I'm not a weenie! "
"SpongeBob"," That's impossible! "
"SpongeBob","  I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! "
"SpongeBob"," So, your name's Reg?"
"SpongeBob"," Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? "
"SpongeBob"," I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uhh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. "
"SpongeBob","  I am not a weenie!"
"SpongeBob"," My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. "
"Patrick"," You tell 'em, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what're you doing here?"
"Patrick"," I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays."
"Patrick"," Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?"
"Patrick"," Barnacles!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only one of getting into the Salty Spitoon. "
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous."
"SpongeBob"," I've got no choice."
"Patrick"," Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Afternoon, Reg."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that makes me pretty mad."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny."
"SpongeBob","  I, uhh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! "
"Patrick"," Who, me? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!"
"Patrick"," Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! "
"Patrick"," Tubby?  Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?"
"Patrick"," Oh yeah.  No, please wait.  No, please, have mercy! "
"SpongeBob"," I did?"
"SpongeBob"," Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?"
"Sandy"," You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. "
"SpongeBob"," I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos."
"SpongeBob"," Weenie Hut General!?"
"Squidward"," Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gere-Bear? "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," How about a little music to count me money to? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music. "
"SpongeBob"," I surrender! Oh."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?"
"Squidward","  I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order!"
"SpongeBob"," #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?"
"Squidward","  Hilarious. Just deliver the food."
"SpongeBob","  There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I feel completely recharged!"
"SpongeBob"," That sounds like Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me."
"SpongeBob"," That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels ""recharged.""  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot. Nah."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again."
"Mr. Krabs"," The one that goes ""bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?  Boo-boo-bop? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!"
"Squidward","  That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too."
"Squidward","  How did you...?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What is it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?"
"Squidward"," Umm... yeah, sure."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, let's hear it, lad."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why?"
"Squidward"," It was rated ""R.""  Arr! Because it's... about... pirates."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!"
"SpongeBob","  Not even a chuckle. See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot."
"Squidward"," There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What? What is it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!"
"SpongeBob"," That's the final test, Squidward. The love test. Robots can't love."
"Squidward"," No, wait, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What is it, SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get back to work, Mr. Squidward."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahhh! Oh, my eyes! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr... "
"Squidward"," Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries."
"Squidward"," Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Squidward"," I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!"
"SpongeBob","  Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!"
"Squidward"," Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know.  Hey, a nickel! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop."
"Squidward"," We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot."
"Squidward"," They poop on the robot?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information."
"Squidward"," I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!"
"Squidward"," Shut up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!"
"Squidward"," I said ""shut up!,"" you bucket of bolts! "
"SpongeBob"," I can't take it! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, are you okay?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!"
"Squidward"," No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Squidward"," And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know."
"SpongeBob"," Right. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. "
"Squidward"," We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Where's Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Where's Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!"
"SpongeBob"," This is one stubborn robot."
"Mr. Krabs","  What?!  You think I'm a robot?!"
"Squidward"," We don't think; we know."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward","  He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way."
"SpongeBob"," I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his ""little buddy."""
"Squidward"," Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy."
"Squidward"," We're just gonna see what your ""little buddy"" knows. "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!"
"Squidward"," Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! That cost me $24.95!"
"SpongeBob"," I guess it didn't know anything."
"Squidward"," Go get the toaster. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!"
"SpongeBob","  This is the last robot, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No! "
"Squidward"," I thought you said robots can't cry."
"SpongeBob"," I also said they couldn't love."
"Mr. Krabs","  I loved it like it was me own."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, at least he's not laughing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?"
"SpongeBob"," The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge! "
"Patrick"," I see you got the paper. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going!"
"Patrick"," Yep, see you later. "
"Patrick"," Well I didn't say anything."
"SpongeBob"," I didn't say anything, either."
"SpongeBob","  Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something."
"Patrick"," Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us!"
"SpongeBob"," It's a baby scallop."
"Patrick","  I'll take care of this!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet."
"Patrick"," What's the matter, is he stupid?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him."
"Patrick"," Well, we can't just leave him out here."
"SpongeBob"," You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat in the house. "
"Patrick"," Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!"
"SpongeBob","  Is it true? Are you hungry?"
"SpongeBob"," I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty? "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!"
"SpongeBob"," Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. "
"Patrick","  Let's try a donut. "
"SpongeBob"," French fries?"
"Patrick","  A donut? "
"SpongeBob","  All we have left is this apple! "
"SpongeBob"," Of course, scallops love worms! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you should be good for the rest of the... "
"Patrick"," What now?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Aww, don't cry."
"Patrick"," Do something, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!"
"Patrick"," Wait! I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. "
"SpongeBob"," How did you know?"
"Patrick"," How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I'm sure glad you're here."
"Patrick"," I know, good thing there's two of us."
"SpongeBob"," You know Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves."
"Patrick"," Yeah! At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt."
"Patrick"," You're right. If I was a mom......this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!"
"Patrick","  It sure is cute when it's asleep."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah.  Shh! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I never thought being a parent could be this much fun."
"SpongeBob"," Me neither."
"Patrick"," Well, good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready! "
"Patrick"," Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Kid's got a stinky."
"SpongeBob","  Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. "
"Patrick","  Ahh! Wish I could, but I gotta get going."
"SpongeBob"," Going? Where are you going?"
"Patrick","  I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?"
"Patrick"," I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok. "
"Patrick"," Phew, what a day."
"SpongeBob"," Oh great, you're home! Now you can help me with the baby."
"Patrick"," Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to but I'm totally beat from work."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Patrick","  That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, what about my break?"
"Patrick"," Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, ok, tomorrow."
"Patrick"," Phew, another tough day! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break!"
"Patrick"," Work was a killer! I need my chair. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, I really need my..."
"Patrick"," Tomorrow for sure."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'll get to it eventually..."
"SpongeBob"," Uhhh?"
"Patrick"," Uhhh."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick Star, we need to talk."
"Patrick"," Just one more minute, I gotta..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! "
"Patrick"," Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!"
"SpongeBob"," You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything."
"Patrick"," I changed his diaper!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, once."
"Patrick"," He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?"
"SpongeBob","  Hmmm?"
"Patrick"," Oh, that's not that much."
"SpongeBob","  Hmmm?"
"Patrick","  So?"
"SpongeBob","  Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm!? "
"Patrick","  I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise! "
"SpongeBob"," So, what's the plan for the day?"
"Patrick"," No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal!"
"SpongeBob","  Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock."
"Patrick"," Six o'clock."
"SpongeBob"," Six o'clock."
"Patrick"," Six o'clock."
"SpongeBob","  Six o'clock."
"Patrick","  Six o'clock."
"SpongeBob"," Six o'clock."
"Patrick"," Six o'clock. "
"Patrick"," Oh, that was some party!  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. What? What?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing."
"Patrick"," Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me."
"SpongeBob","  Do you remember what you said to me this morning?"
"Patrick"," Somethin' about root beer, right?"
"SpongeBob","  No."
"Patrick"," Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up."
"SpongeBob"," Does...  ""You can take the night off, pal!""  ...ring a bell?"
"Patrick","  I don't need this. "
"SpongeBob"," What? Where do you think you're going?"
"Patrick","  I'm going back to work. "
"SpongeBob"," Work?! "
"Patrick","  He got hit in the head with two coconuts!"
"SpongeBob","  So! This is work?"
"Patrick"," You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes I gotta move the antenna, sometimes I lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you poor, poor thing! By the way, you forgot your briefcase! "
"Patrick","  Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?"
"SpongeBob","  Overtime?!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, overtime, pal!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!"
"Patrick"," You know what that means?"
"SpongeBob"," And that's the kind of work you're doing?"
"Patrick"," ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!"
"Patrick"," You just keep going on working and working!"
"SpongeBob"," ​You never help!  Never!"
"Patrick","  There's that stupid noise again!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window."
"Patrick","  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Did you catch him?"
"Patrick","  No."
"SpongeBob"," Junior? Hey, he's flying!"
"Patrick"," I guess he's all grown up!  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy."
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye."
"Patrick"," Goodbye, Junior."
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore."
"Patrick"," This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume."
"SpongeBob"," Despite all we've been through, it was worth it."
"Patrick"," Yeah... Let's have another!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... "
"Patrick"," A one-way ticket to pain! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob","  Heave-ho! "
"SpongeBob"," But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad."
"Mr. Krabs"," What stupid barnacle told you that?"
"Squidward"," Uhh… "
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Special...?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Secret...?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Assignment?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?"
"Patrick","  No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we're not getting paid at all."
"Patrick"," Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, we'll just paint around all this stuff."
"Patrick"," Good, just don't pay me."
"SpongeBob"," First we need to set up the tarp. "
"Patrick"," Tarp ahoy! "
"SpongeBob"," We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now."
"Patrick"," That will never ever come off."
"SpongeBob"," And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off."
"Patrick"," And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  Careful, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, the lid's already off."
"Patrick"," Oh. Now it's my turn! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm thinking I should do this one too, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Well that was a rip-off. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go."
"SpongeBob","  Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall."
"SpongeBob","  I'm getting to the painting."
"Patrick","  Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards."
"SpongeBob","  No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?  Barnacles!  What could be worse than a giant paint bubble!?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!"
"SpongeBob"," Noooooo!  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!"
"Patrick","  Nonsense! "
"SpongeBob"," Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?"
"Patrick"," Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!"
"SpongeBob"," That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!"
"Patrick"," I think you are over-reacting SpongeBob, I don't see any paint."
"SpongeBob"," Ok,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it. "
"Patrick"," Oh, now I see it!"
"SpongeBob"," This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… "
"Patrick"," Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!"
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs said…"
"Patrick"," Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! "
"SpongeBob"," Did it work? "
"Patrick"," Nope. "
"SpongeBob"," Did it work? "
"Patrick"," Nope."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Did it work? "
"Patrick"," Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!"
"SpongeBob","  Nothing's working!"
"Patrick"," Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen!  We have technology! "
"SpongeBob"," It didn't work."
"Patrick","  This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place!...I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would..."
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet."
"Patrick"," I don't see where you're going with this...  hey, a dollar!"
"SpongeBob"," Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!"
"Patrick","  Wanna bite?"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, ok, we still have time!  Don't panic SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! "
"SpongeBob","  Hurry Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the…?"
"SpongeBob","  We're all done, sir. Everything looks great."
"Patrick"," Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!"
"Patrick","  Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! what's this?"
"SpongeBob","  It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!"
"Patrick","  We didn't do it on purpose!"
"Patrick","  I don't want to be butt-less!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned! "
"Mr. Krabs"," And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you know, just hanging around."
"Patrick"," Boo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly."
"SpongeBob","  No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?"
"SpongeBob"," We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," We're so sorry!"
"Mr. Krabs","  And then did you draw on it with crayon?! "
"Patrick","  I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, boys, you know what I've gotta do now?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean our butts?"
"Patrick"," Can I use mine one last time? "
"Mr. Krabs"," There we go, good as new."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it."
"SpongeBob"," Can I make a Krabby Patty now?"
"Mr. Krabs","  This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee."
"Squidward"," I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Sorry, can't hear you! "
"SpongeBob"," Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?"
"SpongeBob"," POOP?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, POOP! "
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Patty! "
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready! "
"Squidward"," Huh?  Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Can I make a Krabby Patty now- "
"Patrick","  Who said that? Are you a ghost?"
"Patrick"," Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!"
"Squidward"," Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?"
"Patrick"," Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?"
"Squidward"," Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else."
"Mr. Krabs","  The money is always right!"
"Patrick"," The ceiling is right Squidward. You're not a very good employee."
"Squidward"," Fine. May I please take your order?"
"Patrick"," I'll have uhh... uhhhh... "
"Plankton"," Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine! "
"Plankton"," You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should've gotten the turbo.  Hear me Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead... "
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?"
"Patrick"," Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please."
"Squidward","  Will that be for here or to go? "
"SpongeBob"," I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!"
"Patrick"," Me neither."
"SpongeBob"," Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire. "
"SpongeBob"," Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!"
"SpongeBob"," But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds."
"SpongeBob"," Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? ""Plan Your Own Party Kit""? Hey Lou, how much?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see Gary, according to the ""Plan Your Own Party Kit,"" invitations are the first order of business."
"SpongeBob","  A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success. Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, Gary, this ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta this world!  My piñata!  The ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. "
"SpongeBob"," Good question Gary, but not to worry. The ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  800-805 Guests arrive. 805-815 Opening remarks and general discussion. 815-827 Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 827, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 907 running charades.  938 charity apple-bob.  957 Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 1009, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!"
"SpongeBob"," And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success! This is gonna be the coolest party ever! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 800! Here they come!  Don't worry too much Gary, it's only 10 seconds past 800.  Now it's 20 seconds past 800! Maybe no one got their invitations! 30 seconds past 800! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming! I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest! And only 40 seconds late. "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Welcome Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?"
"Patrick"," Sure? "
"SpongeBob"," Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!"
"Patrick"," Thanks. "
"SpongeBob"," So, the punch okay?"
"Patrick"," Not bad, not bad."
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, nice weather we're having."
"Patrick"," It's been very mild, yes."
"SpongeBob"," Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't mind if I do! "
"SpongeBob","  Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests! "
"Patrick"," Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, you dumb bunny, it says, ""Hello, my name is Patrick."""
"Patrick","  Nice to meet you Patrick."
"Mr. Krabs","  Good one, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 903! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," Was he talking to me or you? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you made it!"
"Squidward"," My cable's out."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uhh, sorry to hear about that. "
"Squidward"," Not bad."
"SpongeBob","  I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 1041 to 1047.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!"
"Squidward"," This is lame. "
"Patrick"," ""Nod politely."" "
"Mr. Krabs"," What does yours say, Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Oh, uhh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice try, Plankton. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late! "
"SpongeBob"," Attention everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey Gar, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 1000pm Dance your pants off! 1000pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 852, everyone! 852!  Hey, what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 837, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out? "
"Sandy"," This song's got a great beat."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Knock, knock."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it! "
"Patrick"," So, do you come here often?"
"Patrick"," Hello, SquarePants residence. What? I'm sorry, what? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," You wanna talk to SpongeNob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!"
"Patrick"," Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!"
"SpongeBob"," What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! "
"Patrick"," Sorry, he's not out there. "
"Patrick"," Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet!  I hope they don't touch my special comb."
"SpongeBob","  I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 920! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl...  ...but I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been."
"SpongeBob","  But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police."
"SpongeBob"," Is it too late to offer you some punch?"
"SpongeBob"," All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. "
"Patrick"," That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!"
"SpongeBob"," It was?"
"Patrick"," Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!"
"SpongeBob"," I am?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! "
"SpongeBob","  SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, mailman!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay,  see you tomorrow!"
"Patrick"," Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Hey! A magazine!"
"SpongeBob"," That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest."
"SpongeBob"," Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!"
"SpongeBob"," This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!"
"Patrick","  This guy's got shoes!"
"Squidward"," Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?"
"Squidward"," They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people."
"SpongeBob"," What kind of things?"
"Squidward"," How should I know? Things people wanna buy!  Now keep your paws off my mail."
"SpongeBob"," That's it, Patrick! We gotta becomes entrepreneurs!"
"Patrick"," Is that gonna hurt?"
"SpongeBob"," Quick Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?"
"Patrick"," Uh...  More time for thinking."
"SpongeBob"," No, something real, an item, something you would pay for."
"Patrick"," A chocolate bar?"
"SpongeBob"," That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!"
"SpongeBob"," Fancy living, here we come!"
"Patrick"," Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! "
"SpongeBob"," O.K. Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead."
"SpongeBob"," Good afternoon sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?"
"Patrick"," Yes sir. With or without nuts?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow... what is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's try next door!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?"
"Patrick"," We'll take twenty!"
"SpongeBob"," We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?"
"SpongeBob"," One chocolate bar, coming up!"
"SpongeBob"," I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— "
"SpongeBob"," —lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic."
"Patrick"," Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!"
"SpongeBob"," No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate... There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?"
"Patrick"," He said we were mediocre..."
"SpongeBob"," That's it! He made us feel special!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!"
"SpongeBob"," No, wait Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Why don't we try being nice?"
"Patrick"," Oh, okay."
"SpongeBob"," Remember Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good."
"Patrick"," I love you."
"SpongeBob"," I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try."
"SpongeBob"," Um,  H-H-How you doin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Wanna buy some chocolate?"
"Patrick"," We got him now!"
"Patrick"," Hee hee, it tickles!"
"Patrick"," I'll take 10!"
"SpongeBob"," We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that were too easily distracted."
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house."
"Patrick","  Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Let's shake on it."
"Patrick","  Did you say something?"
"SpongeBob"," Remember Patrick, focus."
"SpongeBob"," Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars."
"Patrick"," Focusing."
"Patrick","  Nice place you got in here."
"SpongeBob"," I can't understand what were doing wrong."
"Patrick"," I can't understand anything."
"SpongeBob"," There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!"
"Patrick","  Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious."
"SpongeBob"," They are most certainly not delicious!"
"Patrick","  Not the way I use them!"
"SpongeBob"," Yet they sell millions of bags a day!"
"Patrick"," Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many."
"SpongeBob","  That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!"
"SpongeBob"," We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!"
"Patrick"," The kill!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, young lady."
"SpongeBob"," We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for..."
"Patrick"," You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever."
"SpongeBob"," If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!"
"Patrick","  Hooray for lying!"
"SpongeBob"," It'll make your hair grow."
"SpongeBob"," They'll make you sound smart."
"Patrick"," It'll keep your face from getting any uglier."
"SpongeBob"," They'll make you fly!"
"Patrick"," You'll fall in love!"
"SpongeBob"," They'll bring world peace!"
"Patrick"," You'll walk through walls!"
"SpongeBob","  You'll rule the world!"
"Patrick"," This'll be the best lie yet!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation."
"SpongeBob","  Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding."
"SpongeBob"," Quick, Patrick, let's help him!"
"SpongeBob"," Careful, put him down gently."
"SpongeBob"," Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?"
"SpongeBob","  Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to."
"SpongeBob"," Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures."
"Patrick","  I can live with that. "
"SpongeBob"," Let's change our names to Why and Bother."
"SpongeBob","  No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please..."
"Patrick","  No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you for your patronage."
"Patrick"," Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money."
"Patrick"," But what are we going to spend it on?"
"Squidward","  Good evening, sir. Table for one, please."
"Squidward"," But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?"
"SpongeBob"," So, how long have you two ladies known each other?"
"Squidward"," Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!"
"SpongeBob","  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," The boys eyes are bigger than his stomach. "
"Squidward","  One Pipsqueak patty  and your bib and highchair."
"SpongeBob"," I respect you, Barnacle Man!"
"SpongeBob"," Evil?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? "
"SpongeBob"," Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! "
"SpongeBob","  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," You can't give up. What if we help you?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," I do!"
"Sandy"," I do!"
"Patrick"," I do!"
"Squidward"," I don't."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! The Mermalair!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too."
"Sandy"," Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way."
"Squidward"," I can think of three good reasons."
"SpongeBob"," Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  Want to see me do it again?"
"Squidward"," Krakatoa! "
"Patrick"," I can finally touch my toes! "
"Sandy"," Does this outfit make me look fat?"
"SpongeBob"," Holy halibut! It's the chief!"
"Patrick"," The whose abouts of what?"
"Sandy"," You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say ""Salsa Verde."""
"SpongeBob"," Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!"
"Squidward"," Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times."
"Patrick"," Does this mean we're not getting pizza? "
"SpongeBob","  Make that two!"
"Squidward","  Three!"
"Patrick","  Four!"
"Sandy","  Five!"
"Squidward"," Krakatoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!"
"Patrick"," I'll save you, Quickster, ahh! "
"Squidward"," Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag...  ma... "
"Sandy"," Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  Ahhhh!  Boom!"
"SpongeBob"," Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!"
"SpongeBob","  Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary!  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime! The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today!"
"Patrick"," Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?"
"Patrick","  Wait for you to get back!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?"
"Patrick"," Hey, that's a great idea!"
"SpongeBob"," You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! "
"Patrick"," Wow. "
"SpongeBob"," Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime! "
"Patrick","  And no line!"
"SpongeBob"," Behold Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning!  And this is the Fountain Of Learning!  And these are the Lockers Of Learning!"
"Patrick","  And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?"
"SpongeBob"," No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning."
"Patrick"," Where is everyone?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 900."
"Patrick","  620? But I thought you said you were late."
"SpongeBob"," Late for being early."
"Patrick"," Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?"
"SpongeBob","  And now, for the room with the most class the Classroom."
"Patrick"," Ohh!"
"SpongeBob","  And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge."
"Patrick"," Ohhh!"
"SpongeBob","  And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board! "
"Patrick"," Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!"
"SpongeBob","  Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars too!  There you are."
"Patrick"," But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good."
"SpongeBob"," Oh now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74."
"Patrick"," Who said that?  Was it him?"
"SpongeBob"," I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project."
"Patrick"," What does he teach us?"
"SpongeBob"," The greatest lesson of all the precious value of life. You see Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die."
"Patrick","  Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher! Think you can handle the second chair?"
"Patrick","  I'm learning!"
"SpongeBob"," This is gonna be great! "
"Patrick","  Who's the fat kid talking to?"
"SpongeBob"," You, Patrick, she's the teacher!"
"Patrick"," Oh."
"Patrick"," Uh...uh..."
"Patrick"," Uh...uh...uh!...24! "
"Patrick","  Why are they laughing?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess it's just in the timing."
"Patrick"," Oh. "
"Patrick"," 24. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick."
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I thought of something funnier than 24."
"Patrick"," Let me hear it."
"SpongeBob","  25. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob","  Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!"
"SpongeBob"," No..."
"SpongeBob","  I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!"
"SpongeBob","  No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  "
"Patrick","  Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?"
"SpongeBob"," What, me? But why?"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks a lot, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Sure thing, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?"
"Patrick"," Psst! SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Just ignore him, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, over here!"
"SpongeBob"," Whatever you do, don't look at him."
"Patrick"," Psst, SpongeBob!  Psst, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important."
"SpongeBob","  What?!"
"Patrick","  Hi."
"SpongeBob","  Hi?! "
"Patrick"," Hey buddy! Funny stuff in there, funny stuff!"
"SpongeBob","  There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!"
"Patrick","  Who cares about a stupid star?"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!"
"Patrick"," I'll deal with you after class!"
"SpongeBob"," It is after class! "
"Patrick"," I don't see anyone fighting, do you?"
"SpongeBob"," They're talking about us! We're fighting!"
"Patrick"," Well, don't mind if I do! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob and I were fighting."
"SpongeBob"," Detention!?"
"SpongeBob","  In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I hate you more."
"SpongeBob"," I'd hate you no matter what."
"Patrick"," Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you."
"SpongeBob","  I'd hate you even if that made sense."
"Patrick"," I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you."
"SpongeBob"," I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out!  Huh?!"
"Patrick"," Ohh...  Hmph!"
"Patrick","  Ohhhhh...! "
"SpongeBob"," Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a Stupid Star!"
"Patrick","  I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry your apology is so long."
"Patrick"," Me too! Let's save Roger! "
"SpongeBob","  I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet."
"Patrick","  Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth!  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!"
"Patrick"," Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! "
"SpongeBob"," We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!"
"Patrick"," Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class! See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie. "
"Squidward"," I like neither. Can I take your order?"
"Squidward"," No. What will you have?"
"Squidward","  Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?"
"SpongeBob","  Psst, try the coral bits."
"Squidward"," That'll be one dollar. "
"Squidward"," Something stupid, I'm sure. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!"
"Squidward"," See? I told you."
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!"
"Squidward"," A very dirty dollar?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, this is my one millionth dollar earned! Every crab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine! Congratulations, sir! You have just given me my one millionth dollar!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing! Now get out!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar!"
"SpongeBob"," Congratulations, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Congratulate yourselves, lad! A captain's nothing without his loyal crew! I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, a trip!"
"Squidward"," I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs! Where we going, Fancy Springs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"Squidward"," Pamper Island?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Try again."
"Squidward"," Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Better than that!"
"Squidward"," Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?"
"Squidward"," No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?"
"Squidward"," How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay! "
"Squidward"," Hey, watch where you're swinging that...  SpongeBob, be careful with... ow!  Okay, I've had enough."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose!  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya!  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it. Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Here she comes...She made it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  For a second or two, I thought she was a goner! "
"Squidward"," So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward! You're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back!  Never, never, never, never, never!"
"SpongeBob"," I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. "
"Squidward"," Oh, puh-lease, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act!  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious!  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip."
"SpongeBob","  Aye aye, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar. "
"Squidward","  That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. "
"Squidward"," We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar!  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I get ya! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick. "
"SpongeBob","  Actually, it's Coral Blue number-  three."
"Mr. Krabs"," I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this. "
"Squidward"," No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore."
"Mr. Krabs","  I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward."
"Squidward"," You're kidding?"
"SpongeBob"," Woo! Is it another fishing trip?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No. It's this sandwich. "
"Squidward"," A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not a sandwich.  The sandwich."
"Squidward"," Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!"
"Squidward"," Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean?"
"Squidward"," Just look at him. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you..."
"Squidward"," Look again. "
"SpongeBob","  You're right. How do we get out of here?"
"Squidward"," If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. ""It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!""  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you  live bait."
"Squidward"," You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, he'll come. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives...  Why couldn't it have been me?!"
"Squidward"," Yes, why couldn't it have been you?! "
"SpongeBob"," Why did he have to go like this?! Why? "
"Squidward"," Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, boys!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, how did you get it back?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade."
"SpongeBob"," What did you give him? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing important! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! What's wrong?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning. "
"Squidward","  Future!"
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary! "
"SpongeBob","  Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? "
"Squidward"," Talk to me."
"Squidward"," A-ha!  I can't believe it's finally here! "
"Squidward"," Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. "
"Squidward","  That's Tentacles! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's last name is Tentacles?"
"Patrick"," Poor guy.  Hey, check out Squidward's new snail."
"SpongeBob","  Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate."
"Squidward"," Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred."
"Patrick"," Wow, a snail made out of bread."
"Squidward"," No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training."
"SpongeBob"," Training?"
"Squidward"," For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday."
"Patrick"," Sunday?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!"
"Squidward"," No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt. "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? "
"Squidward"," Papers. "
"Patrick"," Hmmm, 'Property of Squidward Tentpoles.'"
"Squidward"," That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. "
"SpongeBob"," You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine."
"Patrick"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. "
"Sandy"," Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow. "
"SpongeBob"," Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness. "
"SpongeBob"," Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time."
"Patrick","  Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, your snail is a rock."
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race. "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now."
"SpongeBob","  Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win."
"Squidward","  Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie."
"Patrick","  Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail. "
"Squidward"," Patrick, that's a rock."
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel."
"Squidward"," What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow. "
"Patrick"," My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. "
"Patrick"," You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! "
"Squidward"," Well SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations. "
"SpongeBob"," Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape of his life. "
"Squidward"," I'll alert the paramedics."
"Patrick","  Good one, Squidward."
"Patrick","  A burglar!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, that's the official."
"Squidward"," Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about."
"SpongeBob"," Alright Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it."
"Patrick"," This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here. "
"SpongeBob"," What! "
"Squidward"," Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!"
"Patrick"," It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!"
"SpongeBob"," Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! "
"SpongeBob"," Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Gary? "
"SpongeBob","  Umm, Gary, you can stop now! "
"SpongeBob"," You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! "
"Squidward"," Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!"
"SpongeBob"," You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!"
"SpongeBob"," You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!"
"Squidward"," What?! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary?  Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then... "
"Squidward"," I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock. "
"Patrick"," Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you."
"Squidward"," Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  'The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win? "
"Sandy","    That's for yesterday, SquarePants!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill.  Pearl, do you think I'm... old?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Coral, eh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoop, you're right!  Have a coral day, honey!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little...  Sorry you had to see that. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey, how's about I join you kids?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster.  Hmmm, so that's what I taste like."
"Patrick"," Good morning, Krusty Krew! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?"
"Patrick","  Yeah, it's gonna rock!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to go crazy?"
"Patrick"," I'm already hearing voices!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to—"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!"
"Patrick"," Well, how rude of some people!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!"
"Patrick"," Party!"
"SpongeBob"," What do you think we should do first?"
"Patrick"," What shouldn't we do first? We're young,  we've got wheels,  the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, boys, hangin' out?"
"Patrick","  Yes."
"Mr. Krabs"," I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!"
"Patrick"," I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style."
"Patrick"," Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh..."
"Patrick"," I'm waiting... old man."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uhh... how do you do?"
"Patrick"," Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it."
"SpongeBob"," You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?"
"SpongeBob"," I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late."
"SpongeBob"," Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?"
"Patrick"," I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par- "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?"
"SpongeBob"," Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats."
"SpongeBob"," Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?"
"SpongeBob"," Only the cool kids. "
"SpongeBob"," We're not lost, I've got my compass. "
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye, pals!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now. "
"SpongeBob"," Here we are The Wash."
"Mr. Krabs"," They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now."
"SpongeBob"," Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool."
"Mr. Krabs"," Cool. Gotcha. "
"SpongeBob","  Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!"
"Patrick"," Let's party!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Any port in the store—! wait a minute. This is a Laundromat. "
"SpongeBob"," You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’."
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!"
"Patrick"," Debauchery!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Debauchery!  Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into..."
"SpongeBob"," So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not yet."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, you will.  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm feeling a warm spot."
"Patrick"," Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?"
"Patrick"," I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's not a ride. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Can you feel it now, Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, you wanna know if I can feel it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!"
"SpongeBob","  Lame?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!"
"Patrick"," I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid."
"Mr. Krabs"," The what?"
"Patrick"," I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid."
"Mr. Krabs"," Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now this is more like it! "
"Patrick"," Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals! "
"SpongeBob"," We score here all the time. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Frilly things! We hit the jackpot! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mother?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh,  hehe...  Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!"
"SpongeBob"," Why didn't you ask? "
"Mr. Krabs","  But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes, Mommy. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. "
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good night, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, Mommy. "
"Squidward","  Closing time. The happiest time of the day! "
"SpongeBob"," Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty! "
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill."
"Mr. Krabs"," And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun. "
"SpongeBob"," But, it's old and cold. And so very full of mold."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward. "
"Squidward","  Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders."
"Squidward"," Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?"
"Squidward"," What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad."
"Mr. Krabs"," Gone bad? That's nonsense. Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?"
"SpongeBob"," Because it growled at me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No... no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then...  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So I'm gonna be okay, doc?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Everything okay, doc?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not a good sign. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you want from me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Blec! Why does it smell so foul?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mommy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You have me word as a sailor. "
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, boys! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?"
"Squidward"," Well, it was."
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, silly! It means free toy! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello boy! Say, where's Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Great!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy? "
"Squidward"," Eugene, my man."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! How's the break coming?"
"Squidward"," Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?"
"Mr. Krabs","  No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous."
"Squidward","  Here's your mail, Eugene."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks, Squidward. You look rested."
"Squidward"," Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And... there's no money in here.  How delightful."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Me too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. "
"Squidward"," Uh... ""dream""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!"
"SpongeBob"," Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning."
"Squidward"," Here's the bill. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Your luck just ran out!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not cheap, I'm generous!"
"Squidward"," You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny."
"Mr. Krabs","  Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go."
"SpongeBob"," Wait just a burger-flipping second. "
"SpongeBob"," That would be me SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. "
"SpongeBob"," I'd bet my soul he wouldn't."
"Mr. Krabs"," That depends, how much money we talking about?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll take the money."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Look, Squidward, money!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You think I could've gotten more?"
"Squidward"," He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook. I don't want this foul money.  I want SpongeBob back! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You heard what I said about the money?"
"SpongeBob","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, about trading you for pocket change..."
"SpongeBob"," Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing."
"Mr. Krabs"," You would have?"
"SpongeBob"," No. "
"SpongeBob","  So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink."
"Patrick"," "
"Patrick"," Aww, I got dead again! This game stinks! "
"Sandy"," See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain."
"SpongeBob"," I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah, I forgot. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Sandy, watch me do the ""Grouchy Squidward""!"
"Squidward","  Stop naming moves after me!"
"SpongeBob","  Everybody's an idiot except for me."
"Squidward"," Well, it's true. "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!"
"SpongeBob","  Huh?  Don't worry guys, everything is under control because I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!"
"SpongeBob","  Like this?"
"Patrick"," No, your other bottom!"
"Sandy"," Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?"
"Patrick"," Not until 4."
"Sandy"," Ooh, that's gotta hurt!"
"Patrick"," Do it again! I wasn't looking!"
"SpongeBob"," My what has a what now?"
"SpongeBob","  You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt! I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside I'm warning you!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew. That was close!"
"SpongeBob"," No. "
"Squidward"," Is this where the line starts? "
"SpongeBob"," My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe! "
"Sandy"," Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob! "
"Patrick","  That was fun. "
"Sandy","  Hey, SpongeBob, ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob","  Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? "
"Sandy"," Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. "
"Sandy"," That's crazy talk! "
"Patrick"," That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk!  Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. "
"Patrick"," Or your other armpit! "
"SpongeBob"," I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking…My people are sedentary. "
"Sandy"," Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome? "
"SpongeBob"," I won't be alone, so I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin. "
"Sandy"," How are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? "
"SpongeBob"," No problem!  A really long spatula. "
"Sandy"," What about eating? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, sooner or later you're gonna have to go outside! "
"SpongeBob"," Listen, I've told you but I'm never leaving my house again. "
"Patrick"," Never ever? "
"SpongeBob"," Never ever ever! "
"Patrick"," Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?! "
"SpongeBob"," Never ever never never ever ever never!! "
"Patrick"," Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?! "
"SpongeBob","  Never ever... "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? "
"Patrick"," Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward! "
"Squidward","  No! "
"Patrick"," Aww! "
"Sandy"," Don't worry Pat, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. "
"Patrick"," And that's when I  punch him, right? "
"Sandy"," Look at all the jellyfish out here! Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun! "
"Patrick","  I caught one!  Huh? "
"SpongeBob","  Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing! My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it Chip? Dust collecting!  I think I caught one! "
"Sandy"," We've got to try something else! "
"Sandy"," Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! "
"Patrick","  That penny has the most beautiful voice. "
"Sandy","  That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! "
"Sandy","  Trampoline! "
"Patrick","  Ice cream! "
"Sandy","  Underwater surfing! "
"Patrick","  Two ice creams! "
"Sandy","  Ferris wheel! "
"Patrick","  Still two ice creams! "
"Sandy","  Clam wrestling! "
"Patrick","  Washing an old person! "
"Sandy"," Patrick, that's not fun. "
"Sandy"," Nothing's working, Pat! "
"Patrick"," What do we do? "
"Sandy"," Wha...will you get out of here? "
"Sandy"," Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal! "
"Patrick"," Right! "
"Sandy","  All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat!  Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. "
"Sandy","  No, really! You've got to come and save me! "
"SpongeBob","  Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had."
"SpongeBob"," Well, time to punch that clock.  But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime! "
"Squidward"," I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs","  Whee-hoo! "
"SpongeBob","  Gee Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The money!"
"SpongeBob"," The money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. "
"SpongeBob"," Tell me more about summer break. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!"
"SpongeBob"," I've been taught the true meaning of summer."
"SpongeBob","  Almost closing time, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," See anything, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool."
"Mr. Krabs"," True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. "
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!"
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Land, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice to meet you, Monroe. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability wavers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal."
"SpongeBob","  Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em."
"SpongeBob"," Stall 'em? How do I do that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know. Be entertaining. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, kids!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!"
"SpongeBob"," Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops."
"SpongeBob","  My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey kids, check this out. "
"SpongeBob"," I got 'em right where I want 'em. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff."
"Mr. Krabs"," Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," The kids are using them as... boomerangs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!"
"SpongeBob"," What are we gonna do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!"
"SpongeBob","  Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out there and tell 'em!"
"SpongeBob","  Listen everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!"
"SpongeBob"," Who do you want?"
"SpongeBob"," When do you want him?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, here you go!  Hey kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll say you have."
"SpongeBob","  How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils."
"SpongeBob"," But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?"
"Mr. Krabs","  The children? I don't care about the children!  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose!  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh."
"SpongeBob","   I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago."
"Squidward"," You mean this morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer."
"SpongeBob"," Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun."
"Mr. Krabs","  Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!"
"Squidward","  Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back? "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, I'm scared! "
"Squidward"," Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?"
"SpongeBob"," We are camping."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Have fun inside. "
"Squidward","  What do you mean, ""have fun inside""?"
"SpongeBob"," Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow."
"Squidward"," Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Don't think I can't see what you're doing!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," You're saying I can't take it!"
"SpongeBob"," But all I..."
"Squidward","  Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little ""have fun inside"" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Have fun inside!"
"Squidward","  That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping! "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward's gonna come camping with us! "
"Squidward","  Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn. "
"SpongeBob"," That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's all crushy-looking."
"Squidward"," It isn't put up yet, you idiots! "
"SpongeBob","  Customization!"
"Patrick"," Genius!"
"SpongeBob"," He's tenderizing the ground!"
"Patrick"," Of course!"
"SpongeBob"," Write that down, write that down! "
"Squidward","  Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?"
"SpongeBob","  Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat."
"Patrick","  Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over."
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over."
"Patrick","  Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over."
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over. "
"Patrick"," Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!"
"Squidward"," Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener."
"SpongeBob"," But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?"
"Squidward"," Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house."
"SpongeBob"," But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit."
"Patrick"," Pretty weenie!"
"Squidward"," All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow."
"Squidward"," Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one ""The Campfire Song Song"". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪"
"Patrick"," ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪"
"Patrick"," ♪Sing another song...♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick!"
"Patrick"," ♪SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...♪"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!  Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪  ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?"
"Squidward"," No! This is relaxing. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?"
"Squidward"," Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!"
"SpongeBob"," But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear."
"Squidward","  A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  don't exist?!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you saying?"
"Squidward"," There's no such thing! They're just a myth."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer. "
"Squidward","  ""I Married a Sea Bear""?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly! "
"Squidward","  ""Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real""? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"
"Patrick"," Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin..."
"Squidward"," You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet."
"Squidward"," Okay. Then what?"
"SpongeBob"," Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast."
"Patrick"," Flashlights are their natural prey."
"Squidward"," You're kidding."
"SpongeBob"," Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"Squidward","  Go on."
"SpongeBob"," Don't ever eat cheese."
"Squidward"," Sliced or cubed?"
"SpongeBob","  Cubed. Sliced is fine."
"Squidward"," Yeah, yeah, and?"
"SpongeBob"," Never wear a sombrero..."
"Patrick"," ...in a goofy fashion!"
"SpongeBob"," Or clown shoes."
"Patrick"," Or a hoop skirt."
"SpongeBob"," And never..."
"Patrick"," Ever..."
"SpongeBob"," Ever..."
"Patrick"," Duh!"
"Squidward"," Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off! "
"Squidward"," And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger."
"Squidward"," I don't know...  Just a feeling!"
"SpongeBob","  No."
"Squidward"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. "
"Patrick"," Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack."
"Squidward","  You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up? "
"SpongeBob"," Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion."
"Squidward"," Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this? "
"SpongeBob"," No. Like that."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, are you okay?"
"Squidward","  No."
"SpongeBob"," Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!"
"Patrick"," Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once."
"Squidward"," Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't run! Sea bears hate that!"
"Squidward"," Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then."
"SpongeBob"," They hate limping more than running!"
"Squidward"," Well, I guess I'll just have..."
"SpongeBob"," I should have warned you about crawling."
"Squidward"," What'd I do that time?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you."
"Patrick"," Pretend to be somebody else!"
"SpongeBob"," Here, draw a circle. "
"Squidward"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," That was an oval. It has to be a circle!"
"Squidward","  Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!"
"Squidward"," What attracts them?"
"Patrick"," The sound of a sea bear attack."
"SpongeBob"," Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity."
"SpongeBob","  It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity."
"SpongeBob","  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gar? "
"SpongeBob"," Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!"
"SpongeBob"," That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.  All right! "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy."
"SpongeBob"," Is there a problem?"
"SpongeBob","  While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh? "
"Squidward"," Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one."
"SpongeBob"," But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?"
"Squidward"," Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps."
"SpongeBob"," Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius."
"Squidward","  Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but..."
"SpongeBob","  Cover me till I get back, okay?"
"Squidward"," Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey! "
"SpongeBob"," Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?"
"Patrick"," As I do every morning."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I need you to do it again."
"Patrick"," That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you talking about?"
"Patrick"," My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps."
"Patrick"," You lost your name tag? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?"
"Patrick"," I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say ""hi"", just like this morning."
"SpongeBob"," Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," You were supposed to say hi to me."
"Patrick"," Hi."
"SpongeBob"," Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Don't forget your line this time!"
"Patrick"," I won't."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?"
"Patrick"," What's my motivation?"
"SpongeBob"," Forget the motivation. Just say hi. "
"Patrick"," Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob? I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection."
"Patrick"," Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys! "
"Patrick"," That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now."
"Patrick"," Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! "
"SpongeBob"," Eh, what is that stench?"
"Patrick"," That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it."
"Patrick"," I wish I had a nose."
"SpongeBob"," Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine."
"Patrick"," Cannonball! "
"SpongeBob"," You look over there and I'll look over here."
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'm looking. I'm looking."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Patrick!"
"Patrick","  I'm looking as fast as I can."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  Thank you. "
"Patrick"," Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?"
"SpongeBob"," Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!"
"Patrick"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word my. Second word name tag."
"Patrick"," Could I have another hint?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I know where your name tag is. "
"SpongeBob"," Where?! Where?!"
"Patrick"," Uh... I can't remember."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't have time for this! "
"Patrick"," There it is!"
"SpongeBob","  Where?!"
"Patrick"," Uh...  I forgot again."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you with me or against me?"
"Patrick"," Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!"
"Patrick","  Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards."
"SpongeBob"," My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. "
"Patrick","  Don't mention it, buddy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass."
"Squidward"," Hoorah."
"Mr. Krabs","  Okay, boy, your turn."
"SpongeBob","  I think you'll find everything shipshape."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. "
"SpongeBob","  Thanks, uh...  Betty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!"
"SpongeBob","  Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!"
"Squidward","  What's all the yelling about?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula. "
"Plankton"," Can I have the secret formula?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"Plankton"," Okay. "
"Mr. Krabs","  But he was persistent!"
"Plankton","  Pretty please?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-uh. "
"Mr. Krabs"," He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!"
"Squidward","  Fascinating."
"Mr. Krabs"," But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?"
"SpongeBob"," With pleasure, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, sure.  Here you go."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good. "
"Plankton"," AH-HAH!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!"
"Plankton"," That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Or what?"
"Plankton"," ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well then, allow me to suggest your next move. "
"Plankton"," Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! "
"Mr. Krabs","  And now for the chaser! "
"Plankton"," You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands. "
"Plankton"," I don't want to talk about it."
"Plankton"," Leave me alone."
"Plankton"," And she's off, ladies and gentlemen."
"Plankton","  I'm a failure!"
"Plankton"," Henchmen?"
"Plankton"," I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?"
"Plankton"," I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me."
"Plankton"," That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here! Welcome, brethren! "
"Plankton"," I've been away from home longer than I thought. "
"Plankton"," Uh..."
"Plankton"," Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen."
"Plankton","  Yes, that's my first name. "
"Plankton","  Will you please-!"
"Plankton"," All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name."
"Plankton"," Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?"
"Plankton"," Well, what do you want?"
"Plankton"," Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for..."
"Plankton","  Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! "
"Plankton","  I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, you and what army, bug?"
"Plankton"," What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You planted grass?"
"Plankton"," GRASS?!? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton. "
"Plankton"," You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination. "
"Plankton"," Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Curse you Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear! "
"Plankton"," Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!"
"Plankton"," Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula."
"Plankton"," Begging won't help."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes."
"Plankton"," Eye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eye."
"Plankton"," I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton! Wait!"
"Plankton","  ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm warning ya...!"
"Plankton","  ...A cup of love...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't do it!"
"Plankton"," ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I warned ya."
"Plankton"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey. Why ain't you running?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out of here! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey guys. Did I miss anything? "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out. "
"Squidward"," Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress."
"Mr. Krabs","  Curse you, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪  ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪  ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. "
"SpongeBob","  I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! "
"Patrick"," What's that contraption, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," That, Patrick, is a flying machine."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," What's so funny?"
"Patrick"," Well, it's like my grandpa used to say. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff! "
"Patrick"," You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't remind me."
"Patrick"," We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Ready!"
"SpongeBob","  It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh! "
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! "
"Patrick"," Oh boy, a birthday party!"
"SpongeBob","  No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board."
"Patrick"," Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, get ready to say ""Eureka!"""
"Patrick"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Go!  It's working! I'm flying! "
"SpongeBob"," Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite."
"SpongeBob"," ""Local nutcase tries to fly""?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs too!"
"SpongeBob","  You'll see. "
"SpongeBob"," Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh? "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon."
"SpongeBob"," There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! "
"SpongeBob","  ♪I'm flying. I'm flying!♪"

"SpongeBob","  I'm coming! "
"SpongeBob","  That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!"
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But SpongeBob, it's an emergency!"
"SpongeBob","  Let's roll!  Where to, Mr. K?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... my garage."
"SpongeBob"," You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure you're up for it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," I think my pants can handle it."
"Mr. Krabs"," I need you..."
"SpongeBob","  Yes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," To clean..."
"SpongeBob"," Clean up crime?"
"Mr. Krabs"," My garage."
"SpongeBob","  That's your emergency?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!"
"SpongeBob","  All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  And the recyclables?"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, shrimp.  Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick's in trouble."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  What is it, buddy?"
"Patrick"," Will you scratch my tummy?  Ah..."
"Squidward"," Clean my bathtub? "
"Plankton"," Help spread the word of evil? "
"SpongeBob","  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are."
"SpongeBob"," Dennis? "
"SpongeBob","  If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it was fun while it lasted.  I guess I'm not meant to fly after all.  Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show...  ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪  ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪  ♪Kites are made for windy days.

"Patrick","  Hey! Let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice."
"SpongeBob"," No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish. "
"Patrick"," Suit yourself. "
"SpongeBob","  Did Patrick just...?  Nah! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait for it... "
"Squidward"," Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi... "
"Squidward"," ...graine. Heh, heh, heh."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?"
"Squidward"," Yeah, great."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, yeah."
"Squidward","  Yes..."
"SpongeBob"," Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter."
"SpongeBob"," Yes. "
"Squidward"," How's it going, Lieutenant?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts."
"Squidward"," Whatever. Huh?  SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?"
"SpongeBob"," Who?"
"Squidward"," That's the Tattletale Strangler."
"SpongeBob"," Who?"
"Squidward"," The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in. "
"SpongeBob"," He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Strangler."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that looks like me! "
"SpongeBob"," You nice officers will protect me, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard."
"Mr. Krabs","  I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," This would be him, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs","  The Tattletale Strangler?  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you! "
"SpongeBob","  Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. "
"SpongeBob"," You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. "
"SpongeBob"," I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? "
"SpongeBob"," Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?"
"SpongeBob"," We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first I gotta do a few errands."
"SpongeBob"," Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll take both! "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?"
"SpongeBob"," Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have."
"SpongeBob"," Protect me?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! With these spiky cleats, anything is possible!  Ya!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, here we are!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, Isn't it great?  Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?"
"Patrick"," It's on the invitations you sent us.  Let's boogie! "
"SpongeBob"," Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye eh the rest.  Ahh, alone at last."
"SpongeBob"," Just you, me, and the floorboards.  Yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," How did you guys know today is my birthday?"
"Patrick"," We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more! "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for coming!  Alone again."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah."
"Patrick"," Great parties, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend."
"Patrick"," I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! "
"SpongeBob"," So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy."
"SpongeBob"," He's not?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?"
"Squidward"," Did someone say 'party'? "
"SpongeBob","  Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm not safe! Come back! "
"SpongeBob","  Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!"
"SpongeBob","  The Strangler! "
"Patrick"," Hey, Mac,  what're you in for?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag  seanut brittle can."
"Patrick"," Oh boy, Seanut Brittle--Gimmie!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?"
"Patrick"," Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!  Where's the Seanut Brittle?"
"SpongeBob","  That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside."
"Patrick","  Seanut Brittle?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah!  Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.  Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see!  Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Hey, Seanut Brittle!  Oh, darn it, not again!"
"SpongeBob"," Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster too."
"Patrick"," I don't get it."
"SpongeBob"," You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Ok, Frank, let's see what you've got."
"Patrick","  I don't get it."
"SpongeBob"," What can we get  for one dollar?"
"SpongeBob"," What else have you got?"
"SpongeBob"," Nah."
"SpongeBob"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Eww! Don't you have anything good?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, invisible spray!"
"Patrick"," But I can see it."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray."
"Patrick"," What are we gonna do with it?"
"SpongeBob"," I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair."
"Patrick"," That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's get started."
"Patrick"," OK, I'm ready."
"SpongeBob"," Any particular reason you took your pants off?"
"Patrick"," Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?"
"SpongeBob"," That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second.  Ok, Patrick, give me the can."
"Patrick"," I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea."
"Patrick"," Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!"
"SpongeBob"," Give me that thing."
"Patrick"," Hey, the invisible spray works!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!"
"Patrick"," I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny."
"SpongeBob"," Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?"
"Patrick"," Yeah.  I see what you mean."
"SpongeBob"," No guts, no glory!"
"Patrick"," Oh hey, I think this thing is empty."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it."
"Patrick"," Hey, I think I found our pants.  Oops! Here, these are yours."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off."
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh sure, it's...half past invisible."
"Patrick"," Gee, it's getting late."
"SpongeBob"," Let's ask this guy. Excuse me sir, but do you have the time?"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you."
"Patrick"," Don't mention what?"
"Patrick"," Me."
"Patrick"," Hey, I'm no ghost! The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea."
"Patrick"," Lay it on me."
"SpongeBob"," OK, we're invisible, right?"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank."
"SpongeBob"," Let's go scare us some suckers!"
"Sandy"," Huh?  Well, that's funny, I thought I heard voices. Huh?  I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.  And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?"
"Sandy"," I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, we really scared her!"
"Patrick"," Who's gonna be our next victim?"
"SpongeBob"," A better question would be, ""Who isn't?"""
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Ghosts! "
"SpongeBob"," It's official-- we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs."
"Patrick"," It says he isn't scared of ghosts."
"SpongeBob"," We'll see about that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wha? "
"SpongeBob"," Krabs, we've come to haunt you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay back, I'm well-armed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm warning you!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I gotta get out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut."
"Mr. Krabs","  You'll never get me!"
"Patrick"," Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber."
"SpongeBob"," Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Please, spirits, leave me be."
"Patrick","  We got him good, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  No, spirits, please! "
"SpongeBob"," Pay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No!"
"SpongeBob","  Pay! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  I know not these names of which you speak."
"Patrick"," Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again. "
"Mr. Krabs"," So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts."
"SpongeBob"," We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, come on boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened."
"Patrick"," Me too."
"Mr. Krabs"," Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't mention it."
"SpongeBob"," That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," The Krusty Krab presents... live nude pranksters!  Starring the Bikini Bottom Ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob","  We should have bought the whoopee cushion! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?"
"SpongeBob","  New business hours 6 a.m. to 11 p.m."
"Squidward","  What? That is totally unfair!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's right. That's totally unfair. Couldn't we get to work earlier than six a.m.? Like 530 a.m.? Or 500 a.m.? Or 400 a.m.? Or— "
"Squidward"," Zip it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...?  ...The Chum Bucket open 23 hours? So that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he's wrong!"
"Mr. Krabs"," As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours! "
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming!  Well, I'm not dreaming. "
"Plankton","  Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula.  Why aren't you laughing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw, day 3!"
"SpongeBob","  Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Day 10 of non-stop service!"
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No one goes home!"
"Squidward","  Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?"
"SpongeBob","  ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," You could learn a few things from that boy."
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. "
"Plankton"," Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion, but with a little more pressure, the Sponge will crack like an egg , and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eww! A spider bug. "
"Plankton"," Come on! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order?  10,000 Krabby Patties! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again?  Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute; this isn't some kind of prank, is it?"
"Plankton"," Eh...no."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order!  I'm counting on you, boy. I need you to raise that spatular.  Yeah! And I need you to say, ""Team Krusty Krab!"""
"SpongeBob"," Team Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties.  And no breaks!"
"SpongeBob","  Did you hear that spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks!  Wow! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Day 15! Give it up for day 15! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...♪ "
"SpongeBob"," 1,322..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Day 23! Give it up for day 23! "
"SpongeBob"," 6,654..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Day 30!"
"SpongeBob"," 7,121... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Day...35...! "
"SpongeBob"," 8,659... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Day...  anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track."
"Squidward","  43...! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the flimflam?  What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food.  Boy? "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hey Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, I'm worried that...  Got it?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, I said I'm worried that... "
"SpongeBob"," That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal  Stay back! I'm warning you!"
"Mr. Krabs","  All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to... "
"SpongeBob"," No, don't eat me; I'm too chewy.  Holy shrimp! They're everywhere! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," No, no! I want to live!  I want to live "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs","  There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. "
"SpongeBob","  Spatular."
"Mr. Krabs","  and here's the grill."
"SpongeBob","  Grill."
"Mr. Krabs","  and here are some fresh Krabby... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm, there may be a problem after all."
"SpongeBob"," What does this mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Wrestler?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, a psychiatrist."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?  Ow!  Hey, look at this! ""Dr. Peter Lankton Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias"". Gosh, I don't know about this, Krabs; wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see...  Well, this looks like the place.  Hello? Doctor?"
"Plankton"," Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch.  Now...  Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head."
"SpongeBob"," You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink . Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?"
"Plankton"," Hope, hope? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you.  Yeah, I mean you'll be cured in no time."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, good."
"Plankton"," Let's start with a simple exercise."
"SpongeBob"," Jumping jacks?"
"Plankton"," I want you to close your eyes.  Tighter  Tighter  Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?"
"SpongeBob"," I see giant Krabby Patties."
"Plankton"," Good, and what are they made of? "
"SpongeBob"," Hatred!"
"Plankton"," No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?"
"SpongeBob"," They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! "
"Plankton"," Wait, where'd you get that piano?  We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"Plankton"," Work."
"SpongeBob"," Work."
"Plankton"," Spatula."
"SpongeBob"," Spatula."
"Plankton"," Bun."
"SpongeBob"," Bun."
"Plankton"," See, the key is to say something different than what I say."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay, I've got it."
"Plankton"," Potato."
"SpongeBob"," Poh-tah-toe."
"Plankton"," Tomato."
"SpongeBob"," Toh-mah-toe. "
"Plankton"," I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know…oh yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that."
"SpongeBob"," Um, you're making me nervous."
"Plankton"," Oh, o.k.  I'll be over here, then."
"SpongeBob"," I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano. "
"Plankton"," Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you."
"SpongeBob"," Fiber?"
"Plankton"," No, hypnosis."
"SpongeBob"," Hypnosis?!"
"Plankton","  Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula.  Hey, wake up!  Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious?  Why won't you wake up?!"
"SpongeBob"," Where am I? "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, thanks!"
"SpongeBob"," The king of flavored dairy drinks!  Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again."
"SpongeBob"," In my heart?"
"Plankton","  Wake up!"
"SpongeBob","  It worked! I'm cured!"
"Plankton"," But what about the formula."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!"
"Plankton","  No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work. You're still sick! Very, very sick! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I can safely say, ""No more 24 hour shifts"", because 23 hours will be plenty! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs...! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, seriously. Get back to work!"
"SpongeBob","  Easy...  Perfection!"
"Squidward"," Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away. "
"Squidward"," Oh, brother.  Number 5. Number 5!"
"SpongeBob","  That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come out here, boy."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole."
"SpongeBob","  What's a hidey-hole?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!"
"SpongeBob"," What's in this thing? Treasure?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy."
"SpongeBob"," Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo."
"SpongeBob"," Neat."
"Mr. Krabs"," And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'. "
"SpongeBob"," How'd you win that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," By being the toughest of the tough!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's ""'Ol Iron Eye"", , and ""Mutton Chop"", , me, , ""Torpedo Belly"", , and ""Lockjaw Jones"". "
"SpongeBob"," Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course! I was called ""Armor Abs Krabs""."
"SpongeBob"," You were?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess you were thinner back then."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch."
"SpongeBob"," You want me to punch you in the stomach?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!"
"SpongeBob","  wow, my entire arm disintegrated."
"Mr. Krabs"," I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No!! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't look at me! Leave me be!"
"SpongeBob","  You're alive! And naked..."
"Mr. Krabs","  It's true. I've molted."
"SpongeBob"," What's molted?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab! "
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How...  ...oops."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good... "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look Mr. Krabs, I'm you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're a genius."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in..."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me."
"SpongeBob"," I get to be a navy buddy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, show me what you got."
"SpongeBob","  Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad."
"SpongeBob"," I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's me. "
"SpongeBob"," Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, ok I get the point."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That'll do SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! "
"Mr. Krabs","  No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I won't let you down."
"SpongeBob","  Coming! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, what have I done?"
"SpongeBob"," Ok boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here."
"Mr. Krabs"," I've created a monster."
"SpongeBob"," Like pineapple? I live in one. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if you think you're man enough."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh, this could be bad."
"SpongeBob"," Fire the torpedoes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," He did it."
"Mr. Krabs"," This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the trophy everybody. "
"SpongeBob"," I...uhh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Say something."
"SpongeBob"," Let me spin you a manly yarn."
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Atta boy."
"SpongeBob"," So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm doomed."
"SpongeBob"," Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble..."
"SpongeBob"," Why jellyfishing, of course."
"Mr. Krabs"," Phone call for Mr. Krabs!   Get off the stage."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean,  arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't watch. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville boys, uhh, men."
"Mr. Krabs"," No!! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," None taken, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon lad, let's go home."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't understand."
"Mr. Krabs"," You, too, Torpedo Belly?"
"SpongeBob"," Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. "
"Squidward"," Wow, this time I'm really late again. Maybe he'll finally fire me.  Locked?"
"SpongeBob","  This isn't happening. This isn't happening!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," The horror, it's unspeakable.  Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!"
"Squidward"," You mean I got out of bed for nothing?"
"SpongeBob"," The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, you're here!  Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space now?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Harsh. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Arrgh, me back!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh good, I thought you were hurt."
"Mr. Krabs","  I am hurt, ya idiot!  I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind.  Oh, me back."
"SpongeBob"," Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm serious, Squidward."
"Squidward"," So am I."
"SpongeBob"," We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again."
"Squidward"," What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you. "
"SpongeBob"," That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea.  Thanks for coming with me, Patrick."
"Patrick"," No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store. "
"SpongeBob"," I've never seen so many mattress."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," How many do you think there are?"
"Patrick","  10."
"SpongeBob"," Cool."
"Squidward"," What are you morons doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress."
"Squidward"," Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card.  Trying to outsmart me, will ya?  There, I signed it for all of us."
"Patrick"," Hey, you didn't even help pay."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy with his new mattress . "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?"
"SpongeBob"," We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress."
"Squidward"," So I suggested we get you a new one."
"Patrick","  I thought it was your idea."
"Mr. Krabs","  So, where's me old mattress then? "
"Squidward"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump."
"Mr. Krabs","  All my money was in that mattress!"
"Squidward"," What?! Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! "
"Patrick"," And we got you a card."
"Mr. Krabs","  Is there money in it?"
"Patrick"," Nope. "
"SpongeBob"," Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?"
"Squidward"," It was SpongeBob's fault. Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea."
"Patrick"," I knew it!"
"Squidward"," Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ...help you do it myself."
"Patrick"," ' Wow, he really does care. "
"Patrick"," What a dump."
"SpongeBob"," We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?"
"SpongeBob"," Terrific, Patrick, you found it!"
"Squidward"," What? Where? Lemme see. Where?"
"SpongeBob"," There it is Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm."
"Squidward"," Oh, that figures. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it."
"Squidward"," Okay, here's the plan you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm."
"Patrick","  Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Because that would be rude, Patrick."
"Squidward"," And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!"
"Patrick","  Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe."
"Patrick"," Gee, thanks buddy."
"Squidward"," My pleasure. Now let's gets a move on. "
"SpongeBob","  Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here."
"Patrick"," Wow. "
"Squidward"," What are you morons doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here."
"Patrick"," Where? I can't see them. "
"Patrick"," Let's do it again. "
"Squidward"," What did you idiots do?"
"Patrick"," Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm too."
"Squidward"," I didn't do it! You blockheads woke... the... worm. "
"SpongeBob","  Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out."
"Squidward"," Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out."
"SpongeBob"," Understood. Out."
"Squidward"," No! In! Out."
"SpongeBob"," Understood. Out."
"Squidward"," Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Affirmative."
"Squidward"," Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it."
"SpongeBob"," Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'."
"Patrick"," Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'"
"SpongeBob"," I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick! "
"Squidward"," And my perfect plan falls into place. "
"Patrick","  Uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I think I know why our code name is ""Worm-bait"". "
"SpongeBob"," Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm. "
"Patrick"," Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon."
"SpongeBob","  Wow, I think you're right, Patrick."
"Patrick","  See if he plays catch."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy! "
"Squidward"," Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed. "
"Squidward"," Alright, you two, what's the holdup?"
"SpongeBob"," We feel silly."
"Squidward"," Come on, do it for old man Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Sure, but first, put on this cologne."
"SpongeBob","  Steak sauce? "
"Squidward"," Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell ""Trick or treat!"" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress."
"Patrick"," Gimme that cologne. "
"Squidward"," Now get in there!"
"SpongeBob"," Happy Halloween, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs? "
"Patrick"," That guard worm doesn't look very happy."
"SpongeBob"," Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!"
"Mr. Krabs","  It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!"
"Patrick"," Trick or treat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed like meat?"
"SpongeBob"," Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I give up. "
"Plankton","  And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty. "
"Plankton"," Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife. "
"Plankton"," Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... "
"SpongeBob"," Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Look at you, Plankton. Once again you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure? "
"Plankton"," Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?"
"Plankton","  Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering."
"Mr. Krabs","  Sue?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?"
"Plankton"," Well...if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence."
"Mr. Krabs"," Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!"
"Plankton","  See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  oh the pain! The deep-frying pain! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands."
"Mr. Krabs"," What I really need is a good lawyer."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?"
"SpongeBob"," No, they're usually silver."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset."
"SpongeBob"," But I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!"
"SpongeBob"," But what about Mr. Krabs' case?"
"SpongeBob"," But, I'm a...a liability."
"SpongeBob","  Really? Everything?"
"SpongeBob"," A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit."
"Plankton","  I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula."
"Mr. Krabs","  Never, you little runt! "
"Plankton","  Oww, oww! My wittle arm! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him."
"Plankton"," Oww! My other arm! "
"Mr. Krabs"," He's lying! Bah!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't know where he could be."
"SpongeBob"," Here I am!"
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor."
"Mr. Krabs","  What are you doing here, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep, right in here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Is there a problem?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm...your lawyer didn't give me the combination."
"Plankton"," Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pull yourself together, boy."
"Plankton"," Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," How's it coming lad?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. "
"Plankton"," Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid."
"SpongeBob"," Bombs away! "
"Plankton"," Ahem! Are you quite finished?  Now where was I, oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram...sorry.  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!"
"Plankton","  Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's a ""wet floor"" sign."
"Plankton"," Do you own one?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed superfluous?"
"Plankton"," No more questions."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender ? "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?"
"Squidward"," Yes."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?"
"Squidward"," Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Must...open...case."
"SpongeBob"," So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? "
"SpongeBob"," Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm doomed."
"Mr. Krabs"," You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you. We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it? "
"SpongeBob"," Defense calls Plankton to the stand. "
"SpongeBob"," Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?"
"Plankton"," To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty."
"Plankton","  Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'll take that!"
"Plankton"," Huh? No, no, no!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. "
"Plankton"," No, no, no, no!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning."
"SpongeBob"," That's OK, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present."
"Mr. Krabs"," A present? For me?"
"SpongeBob"," Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a ""wet floor"" sign. I made it myself."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary."
"Patrick"," How is Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy."
"Patrick"," Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh...  Who was I talking to?"
"SpongeBob","  Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. ""Dear Sir or Ma'am...  We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience.""  Hello?  My package. Whoopee!  Oh, let's see what we got here.  My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? ""Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row."" Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it."
"SpongeBob","  Darn it."
"SpongeBob"," What was that?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. "
"SpongeBob"," So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets - sometimes I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers."
"Patrick","  I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Darn it."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, is that you?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, darn it. Darn it."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Darn it. Darn it."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Darn it."
"Patrick"," Snap out of it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I..."
"Patrick"," What is it, buddy? You can tell me."
"SpongeBob"," I took the Dirty Bubble challenge."
"Patrick"," You what?! "
"SpongeBob"," Why are you crying, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Because... many years ago, I took that challenge."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," What happened?"
"Patrick"," I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me."
"SpongeBob"," You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat—fresh seahorse milk."
"Patrick"," Thanks, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?"
"Patrick"," About a week."
"SpongeBob"," A week? Are you sure?"
"Patrick"," Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days."
"SpongeBob"," Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  I can't find Gary."
"SpongeBob"," This never fails—Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of."
"Patrick"," Eight?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand; this is a brand-new... "
"Patrick"," I only tasted six types of sediment. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!"
"Squidward"," What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?   "
"SpongeBob"," You check over there. I'll check in here.  Find him yet, Pat?"
"Patrick","  No, but I'll keep looking."
"SpongeBob","  But there's nowhere left to look."
"Patrick"," There's one place we haven't checked. "
"SpongeBob"," I doubt Gary could fit in there."
"Patrick"," Can't hurt to look."
"SpongeBob"," Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!"
"Patrick"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see. ""Dear SpongeBob These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me."" Dear Neptune, what have I done?"
"Patrick"," What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there."
"SpongeBob"," Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out."
"SpongeBob","  Gary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Refund?! What's wrong with it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary... "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!"
"SpongeBob"," This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong."
"SpongeBob"," Well, you see..."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes it's what you don't say. Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's me boy!"
"SpongeBob"," If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it."
"Mr. Krabs","  Wh...?"
"Patrick"," It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary."
"Patrick"," But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. "
"SpongeBob"," Here's a good spot.  ""Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob"". Quick, hand me the tape."
"Patrick"," Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is no time for that. "
"Patrick"," Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones."
"Patrick"," Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!"
"Patrick"," Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.  Um...uhh..."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. "
"Patrick"," I want peanuts. "
"SpongeBob"," Pat, no! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! "
"Patrick"," Just let it out, buddy. That's right."
"SpongeBob"," I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him."
"Patrick"," Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood!  They were awesome!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary loves balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew it—I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard."
"SpongeBob"," Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary!  So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector!  Hide us, SpongeBob!  Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit. "
"Squidward"," He's got a card.  R.A. Penny Pincher Vending Supplies."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it, set her down easy."
"Squidward"," What is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty.  Gentlemen, meet Skill Crane."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh. Skill Crane."
"Mr. Krabs"," At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up boys. First one's free. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. "
"Squidward"," No, thanks, I'll pass."
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon, Squidward, you know you want to."
"Squidward","  Okay, if you insist.  Thanks."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! In the machine!"
"Squidward"," All right, all right.  Oh, boy, what fun. "
"Squidward","  Did you see that, SpongeBob? I almost got that on my first try!"
"Mr. Krabs","  My work here is done. "
"Squidward"," They don't call me Squidward 'Manual Dexterity' Tentacles for nothing. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, why don't I give it a try? "
"Squidward"," Haha, good luck. You'll…"
"SpongeBob"," It's a bear! I'm gonna call you Beary."
"Squidward"," Hmph, beginner's luck. Now it's the master's turn. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over.  That takes an awful amount of skill."
"Squidward"," Well, thank you for saying so."
"SpongeBob"," Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. "
"Squidward"," Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again…"
"SpongeBob"," There ya go, Beary. "
"Squidward"," Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is… "
"Mr. Krabs","  At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time."
"Squidward"," Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud."
"Squidward","  Oh, what the… Alright. Let's get this over with."
"Mr. Krabs"," Need some change?  There ya are."
"Squidward"," Gee, thanks."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no, Mr. Squidward. Thank you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Need some more change? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Need some change?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Why?"
"Squidward","  Because... I'm... all... out... of...  MONEY!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All out of…? Hmmm.  Boys, it's payday."
"SpongeBob","  But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday."
"Mr. Krabs"," What the... No. It's payday, me boy. Here's your check, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Money, money, money, money, money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I took the liberty of turning your paycheck...  ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or  buy a soda or... something."
"Squidward"," Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away."
"SpongeBob","  Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother. "
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Two in one quarter? That's not fair.  What's that clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion?  There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward."
"Squidward","  A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine.  Yeeowwww!  You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better.  Oooh, phooey!!  I gotta win that crane!  Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!"
"SpongeBob"," Squid, I think you have a problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win!  What's this?"
"Squidward"," The deed to my house. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okey-dokey, then. Carry on."
"Squidward","  If I can just win once, I'd never play again! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine? "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, there's a secret? "
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm. "
"Squidward"," Tell me...  the... secret. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to be a winner? "
"Squidward"," Yes. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah? "
"Squidward"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Yes? "
"Squidward"," Yes! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Squidward"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! The secret?! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my quarter. Then I close my eyes. "
"Squidward"," Close your eyes? "
"SpongeBob"," Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane. "
"Squidward"," Oh, that's ludi... "
"SpongeBob"," See? Now you try. "
"Squidward"," This is ridiculous. If I close my eyes, how will I know where the... "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, do you wanna win or not? "
"Squidward","  Yes! Yes, I do! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in. "
"Squidward"," But this is my last quarter. "
"SpongeBob"," In the machine, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Okay, okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Close your eyes.  Now be the crane.  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. "
"Squidward"," Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it!  I'm a winner! "
"SpongeBob"," You're a winner! "
"Squidward"," I am a winner, aren't I?  Winner, winner, winner!  Wiiiiiinner!  I'm a winner, everybody! You hear that?!  I'm... a winner. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's funny. Last time I checked, you were a cashier. "
"Squidward"," Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking in the presence... of a winner!  Ha! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll try to remember that.  3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters."
"SpongeBob"," Triple decker, on deck. "
"Squidward","  Make way for the winner! "
"Squidward"," You didn't win the prize? "
"Squidward"," You know what that means? "
"Squidward"," It means... you have no skills and you're a loser!  I'm a winner, see my prize! You're a loser who sits and cries!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Did you see how I handled that crane? "
"SpongeBob"," I sure did. "
"Squidward"," I think I had the magic touch. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. "
"Squidward"," I just closed my eyes and became the crane. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, yeah, you're the man. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, look. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply. "
"Squidward"," Be the crane. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Be the crane. "
"SpongeBob"," He did it. Yay, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the… "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch.  Ding.  Tada!  Ah! Squidward, open your eyes! "
"Squidward","  Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane.  Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop!  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the?! "
"Squidward"," Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... Time to go, Teddy. "
"SpongeBob","  Hang on, buddy. I got ya.  I guess I can only pick up toys. "
"Squidward","  Uh-oh! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work."
"Squidward"," Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you."
"SpongeBob"," My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for."
"Squidward"," You did overlook one teensy little detail, however."
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," It's Sunday!  A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!"
"SpongeBob"," Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him.  Man this is heavy.  Oh, pardon me."
"Patrick"," Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!"
"SpongeBob","  Monster! "
"Squidward"," Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday!  My Sunday relaxation kit.  Let's see…pillow.  Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance.  Ah, and the final touch.  Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man.  This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot.  Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation. "
"Squidward"," What are you two idiots doing?!"
"Patrick"," Secret ritual."
"SpongeBob"," To inaugurate you as president."
"Squidward"," Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses."
"Patrick"," No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better."
"Squidward"," Better?"
"SpongeBob"," You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'."
"Squidward"," The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? "
"Patrick"," Maybe. "
"SpongeBob"," It's a secret. "
"Squidward"," Fine! As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer?  Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. "
"SpongeBob"," What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?"
"Squidward"," Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore."
"Patrick"," Our new president is a genius!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. "
"SpongeBob","  Whenever your ready, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Hold still, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Pat, gimme a quick shake."
"Patrick"," Okie dokie. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly! C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot!"
"Squidward","  Oh, no! It's already noon! I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday!"
"Squidward"," What's going on out there?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, president Squidward! Almost done painting the- "
"Squidward","  My eyes! "
"Squidward"," No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… "
"Patrick"," It is a lovely day for a ride in the country."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call Patrick.  OK…Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?"
"Patrick"," Did you find him, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive."
"Patrick"," Or maybe he's on a secret mission!"
"SpongeBob"," I hope he's not in danger!"
"Patrick"," Danger!?"
"SpongeBob"," As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward."
"Squidward"," At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to.  What are you two doing in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin."
"Patrick"," I say he checks out a-ok!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? "
"Squidward"," French tips, huh?  Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto."
"Squidward","  Alright, you two! Out!  And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow or next week."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, does that include…"
"Squidward","  Yes, it does! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?"
"Squidward","  Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever!  You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Pat, maybe president Squidward's right."
"Patrick"," Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all."
"Squidward","  No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors!  And stop calling me president!"
"SpongeBob"," C'mon, let's go. "
"Squidward"," There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Good neighbors my right!  Hello? ""Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation"" "
"Squidward"," That oughta do it! Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now!"
"SpongeBob","  President Squidward?"
"Squidward","  What the…?!"
"SpongeBob"," We hereby present you with this delicious cake."
"Squidward","  ""Sorry for bugging you so much""? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!"
"Squidward","  GRRR, you infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!"
"Squidward"," What's going on?"
"SpongeBob","  It's like a carnival ride."
"Squidward","  Run for your lives!  What the? What are you doing?!  I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me. "
"Patrick"," Wow! Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood!"
"SpongeBob"," We gotta turn this thing off!  Nope, not it."
"Patrick","  Nope."
"SpongeBob","  Nope."
"Patrick","  That's not it, either."
"Squidward","  This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?"
"Squidward"," No-no, don't say anything more. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so I can get ready for work tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. President-"
"Squidward"," Shush."
"SpongeBob"," But we just wanted to…"
"Squidward","  Get out of my house! Huh?"
"Squidward"," Yes! Yes, I am."
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great! The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here they come, lads."
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!"
"Squidward"," Fantastic. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you very much, madam.  I feel so alive! ♪Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪"
"Squidward"," Please don't do that again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who wants to know?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Do I still get the money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around. "
"SpongeBob"," What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm retiring!"
"SpongeBob"," Retiring?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?"
"SpongeBob"," I sure am!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So long, boys."
"SpongeBob"," Have fun, Mr. Krabs. "
"Squidward"," Heaven knows I won't."
"SpongeBob"," New manager?"
"SpongeBob"," Krabby O' Mondays?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O' Mondays? Not the name I would've chosen. But that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute. I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon."
"Mr. Krabs"," How's it going?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whatcha up to?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together."
"Mr. Krabs","  Find some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted. "
"Squidward"," Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O' Mondays."
"Squidward"," Can I start you off with..."
"Squidward"," Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir..."
"Squidward"," Sincere service with a smile."
"Squidward"," Sincere service  with a smile! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, ok son, you're starting to creep my out."
"SpongeBob","  I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, boy, back to work."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye...Eugene. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you this happy."
"Squidward"," They're watching us."
"Mr. Krabs"," That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?"
"Squidward"," Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules."
"Squidward"," I really think you should look. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this? Help me."
"Squidward"," Oh, hey Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook."
"Mr. Krabs"," What have you done to real Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob","  Where's the love?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob"," I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a wor..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that patty you're eating?"
"Mr. Krabs"," See that, without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage."
"Mr. Krabs"," Rules! Here's a rule for ya people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll buy it for full price."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  We did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends."
"Squidward"," Really, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, not really. Get back to work. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What do you want, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar. "
"Squidward"," More like another nickel."
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel. "
"Squidward"," It's not that funny."
"SpongeBob"," It's funny, because it's true! "
"Squidward"," Move over. "
"SpongeBob","  Nickel. "
"Squidward","  Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop! "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Squidward, see ya tomorrow. "
"SpongeBob"," Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Another day, another nickel."
"Squidward"," He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't?"
"Squidward"," No. You should sit down."
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"Squidward","  Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I am?"
"Squidward"," Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, a little."
"Squidward"," And your temperature is 175 degrees!"
"SpongeBob"," It's that bad?"
"Squidward"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing."
"SpongeBob"," I have been laughing a lot, lately."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box."
"SpongeBob"," My laugh box?"
"Squidward"," Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again."
"SpongeBob"," Is that what happened to you, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again. "
"Sandy"," Hey, Patrick, you wanna hear a joke?"
"Patrick"," Sure, Sandy."
"SpongeBob","  Sure, I'd love a good laugh."
"Sandy"," What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous."
"SpongeBob"," How long do I have to avoid laughing?"
"Squidward"," Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, banana peel, don't!"
"Patrick"," What'd you say? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. "
"Patrick"," Hey, what the... "
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!"
"Patrick"," Right foot first..."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh."
"Patrick"," You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out. "
"SpongeBob","  Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!"
"SpongeBob"," I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh! "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!"
"Patrick"," What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone."
"Patrick"," Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come in."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's wrong, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," I lost my laugh."
"Mr. Krabs"," You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Not really."
"Mr. Krabs"," This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it."
"SpongeBob","  Nothing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. "
"Sandy"," Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?"
"SpongeBob"," The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose but now mocks me with its cruel indifference."
"Sandy","  But scientifically speaking, its caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset."
"SpongeBob"," Sounds painful."
"Sandy"," Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Sandy."
"Squidward"," Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack."
"SpongeBob"," I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. "
"Squidward"," I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy. "
"Squidward","  I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop."
"SpongeBob"," But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression."
"Squidward","  Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes."
"SpongeBob"," I could laugh the whole time?"
"Squidward"," Yeah.  You really fell for it."
"SpongeBob"," I guess I did."
"Squidward"," You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine. "
"SpongeBob","  It's really not that funny, Squidward."
"Squidward"," It's hilarious!"
"SpongeBob"," See ya later, Squidward. "
"Squidward","  Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel.  yahhhh!  and falls flat to the ground, while two paramedics come take him to the hospital]"
"Patrick"," Look, he's waking up."
"Squidward","  Where am I?"
"Sandy"," You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box."
"Mr. Krabs"," The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on."
"Patrick"," So they cut it out."
"Squidward"," Cut it out?!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around."
"Squidward","  Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?"
"Squidward"," But, you cut out my laugh box."
"Patrick"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," They wouldn't pay me."
"Sandy"," You're getting warmer."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world. "
"SpongeBob","  Hurry, Patrick, it's almost time for the joust."
"Patrick"," Right behind ya, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, my good man, I believe thou meant to say ""Righteth this wayeth"". "
"SpongeBob"," How's that mutton, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Methinks it's mutton-tastic. "
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this exciting, Patrick? To think, we'll be watching the joust this close up."
"SpongeBob"," Pat, do you know how to ride a seahorse?"
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Seahorse, sir, you're gentle on beginners, aren't you? "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, help!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask for a bathroom break!  Patrick! "
"Patrick","  Glad that's over. "
"SpongeBob","  Look, some employees from the restaurant came to help us."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity. Salutations fellow knights."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! I get the point. "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Pat, these props sure are convincing. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Squidward.  ""Dost thou talketh to me?""  "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, what'd you do?"
"Patrick","  What does a guy have to do get some mutton around here? I'm starving!"
"SpongeBob"," They sure do take their role-playing seriously around here. "
"Patrick"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century? Don't you see, Patrick? We really are in medieval times!"
"Patrick"," Oh no, I think I left the water running at home!"
"Patrick"," Yay!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, we don't leave without Squidly."
"SpongeBob"," Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them. Isn't that right, Squidly?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidly, uhh, maybe you should wait for the king to hear that."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, you don't understand. We're not from here."
"SpongeBob"," No, we're time travelers.  Help me out here, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I'm not sure that there's anything I can add at this point."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess this is it, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I guess so. I'm gonna miss you, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll miss you too, buddy. "
"Patrick"," I guess this is what you call the royal treatment."
"SpongeBob"," We're going on a perilous journey?"
"SpongeBob"," Lemme guess, more praise for our heroic stature?"
"SpongeBob"," Say no more, your majesty. Us manly knights are so manly, we kick ourselves out of places. Come on, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Look out trouble! "
"SpongeBob","  I know we're a prophecy and all, but I don't think we can stop the dragon with our bare hands."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we need some gloves."
"SpongeBob"," At last, an honest man of the soil. Observe, as a I effortlessly commingle with this brutish native.  Greetings, iron man. I am Sir SpongeBob of Bikini…  ...Bottom. "
"SpongeBob"," We just wanted to buy some armor."
"Patrick","  This is awesome.  Hey, SpongeBob, get out here!  Whoa, SpongeBob you look incredible."
"SpongeBob","  A little heavy, isn't it? "
"SpongeBob"," That's perfect! "
"SpongeBob","  It's a good thing I packed us a lunch of delicious Krabby Patties."
"Patrick"," Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick.  We've been sent to rescue Princess Pearl from Planktonamor."
"SpongeBob","  Medieval Sandy! I know how to handle this With a little karate! "
"SpongeBob"," I am bad, oh yeah! Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Pssh, did you hear that Patrick? I told you she thinks like a squirrel.  Good one, Medieval Sandy. But can you handle my feet of fury? "
"SpongeBob"," I don't understand a word you just said!  Uhh, Medieval Sandy, you don't look so good. Sandy? Sandy…?  Patrick, it's working. Do it again. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, karate! "
"Patrick"," No, uhh, I mean yes. Yes! That's what I said, heh. Yes."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you think we fooled them?  Wait, that's Pearl. I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus."
"SpongeBob","  Hang on, Pearl, we're coming to rescue you!  We're a-comin'. Almost there. Oh, dear Neptune."
"SpongeBob","  Unhand her, you fiend!"
"SpongeBob"," We're here to rescue you, Pearl. Whew! Can I get a glass of water?"
"SpongeBob","  You truly are the nastiest wizard in all of Bikini Bottomshire. Prepare to be vanquished."
"SpongeBob","  What the…? Where…? Oh…  I didn't see you. You're so tiny.  That tickles! Tiny powers! Tiny powers! "
"Patrick"," No! No! No! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute.  Wow, the boys back home will never believe this."
"Patrick"," I'm right here and I don't believe it. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess this is it, Pat."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Hey, can we eat those Krabby Patties now?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, buddy."
"Patrick"," Yay!  Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick look! He's eating the Krabby Patties."
"Patrick"," Huh? No! No! No-o-o! The horror. The horror."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, it's a good thing."
"Patrick"," It is?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure it is. Just listen to him purr. He loves that Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Umm, I'd be more than happy to make you some more of those delicious Krabby Patties. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I guess I shouldn't have agitated that seahorse. That was some dream, huh, Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Try telling that to Squidly. "
"Plankton","  Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket. "
"Plankton"," C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique. "
"Plankton"," Hey!"
"Plankton"," Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?"
"Plankton"," Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes."
"Plankton"," Fine, I'm wrong and you're right."
"Plankton","  Why did I ever install that nagging software?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, money. You're always there for me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How much of my money do you want?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye!  Whew, that was a close one."
"Plankton"," Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman - not a girl in a cold-hearted shell.  Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart."
"Plankton"," You're a W.I.F.E.. Wired Integratred Female Electroencephlagraph."
"Plankton","  Why don't you have an 'off' switch? "
"Plankton"," And now to woo that beloved creature. "
"Plankton"," Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan.  You"" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal. "
"Plankton"," Oh, yeah... I am smooth.  Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. "
"Plankton"," Wait! This is your secret admirer."
"Plankton","  No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?"
"Plankton"," It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face."
"Plankton"," Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!"
"SpongeBob"," OK. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet.  Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance."
"Mr. Krabs"," But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, Mommy.  Squidward, I need you to make a return for me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime! "
"Plankton","  I've reservations for two, tonight."
"SpongeBob"," Right this way, sir. "
"Plankton","  Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!"
"SpongeBob"," Terribly sorry, sir.  Will there be anything else?"
"Plankton"," Is my tie on straight?"
"SpongeBob"," You look fabulous!  Your gentlemen caller awaits. "
"Plankton","  Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight. "
"Plankton"," Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket."
"Plankton","  It's across the street."
"Plankton"," It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad!  Never mind, Never mind. I'd like to hear about you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mommy?"
"Plankton"," ""Mommy?"""
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob..."
"Plankton"," This delectable creature is your mother?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?"
"SpongeBob"," And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skullduggory you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. "
"Plankton"," Boyfriend?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But, mommy..."
"Plankton"," You heard the lady. Let me go. "
"Plankton"," That's more like it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mommy?  You!"
"Plankton"," Eugene."
"Mr. Krabs"," I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to."
"Plankton"," I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman."
"Mr. Krabs"," All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother."
"Plankton"," What are you talking about?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!"
"Plankton"," Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time stay away from me mother. "
"Plankton"," Not family, eh? I can fix that. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mommy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh, yeah...funny thing about that."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, mommy. "
"Plankton"," Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing."
"Plankton"," Oh, Mrs. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, brother."
"Plankton"," Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony."
"Plankton"," Would you marry me? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! "
"Plankton"," Gasp!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!"
"Plankton"," Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?"
"Plankton"," What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there? "
"Plankton"," I don't believe this! You led me on!"
"Plankton"," I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even."
"Plankton"," No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh.  Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost than never to be loved at all! "
"Plankton"," So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?"
"Plankton","  Nothing, dear."
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!"
"SpongeBob"," Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man is timeless!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloney ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this...this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me?  Traitors! Wait till we tell Mermaid Man about this. "
"SpongeBob","  Too old for an action movie...huh."
"SpongeBob"," Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?"
"SpongeBob"," But they are! And they're using...  actors."
"SpongeBob"," They have shunned our heroes."
"Patrick"," And they weren't nice to them either."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that makes it even worse."
"Patrick"," Why don't we just make our own movie?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals."
"SpongeBob"," Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and...  their actors."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?"
"Patrick"," Popcorn?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, to start making a movie."
"Patrick"," Oh, oh, oh..."
"SpongeBob"," Let's start with...the title."
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! ""Adventures in the Underground City""."
"SpongeBob"," Great, Pat, what happens?"
"Patrick"," Well, there's a city..."
"SpongeBob","  City..."
"Patrick"," And it's underground..."
"SpongeBob","  Underground..."
"Patrick"," And they have an adventure..."
"SpongeBob","  Adventure..."
"Patrick"," The end."
"SpongeBob"," End.  That's great, Pat.  Hmm, seems kinda short."
"Patrick"," I have an idea. Let's make it longer!"
"SpongeBob"," Longer, yes. Ok, let's have Mermaid Man get his face shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer. "
"Patrick"," Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee."
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Pat. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What are ye lads doing?"
"SpongeBob"," We're making a movie."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, what do ye say, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, Mr Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie."
"Mr. Krabs"," I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," You can be in it, too, Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives. "
"Sandy"," Howdy."
"SpongeBob"," Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick will run the camera."
"Patrick"," Hey... "
"SpongeBob"," This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department."
"Squidward","  Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?"
"SpongeBob"," Not makeup department, you're the makeup artist."
"Squidward"," Artist? "
"SpongeBob"," Makeup artist."
"Squidward"," In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle.  Hmmm...  Time for the art-eest to go to work.  Voila!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?"
"Squidward"," As they'll ever be."
"SpongeBob","  They're beautiful.  They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Ok...action!"
"Sandy"," I love my new job."
"SpongeBob"," Good job, Sandy."
"Plankton"," Psst...  I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray. "
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing?"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, this role was made for me."
"SpongeBob"," That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator."
"Plankton"," I thought Sandy was the boom operator."
"Sandy"," Did somebody say boom?"
"Plankton"," All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Patrick, start the movie!"
"SpongeBob"," Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties."""
"SpongeBob"," Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties."""
"Plankton"," Give it back!"
"SpongeBob"," Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job."
"Plankton"," This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing."
"Sandy"," Did somebody say boom?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, action!"
"SpongeBob"," Cue the sound effects. "
"SpongeBob"," Almost there! "
"Patrick"," Good morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage."
"Patrick"," Yeah, I got the footage."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what is that?"
"Patrick"," Oh, it's a camera."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, this. "
"Patrick"," Oh, that's a lens cap."
"SpongeBob"," Did you just put that on?!"
"Patrick"," Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming."
"SpongeBob","   The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is good. Roll the film."
"SpongeBob"," Mr Krabs, why are you weeping?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers? You promised a full house."
"SpongeBob"," And here comes the filling!  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, this is what I call a happy ending."
"SpongeBob","  Fort Lox home to over five billion Krabby Patties.  What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure?  It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!"
"SpongeBob","  Watch me!"
"Patrick","  You're it. "
"SpongeBob","  You're it.  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!"
"Patrick"," Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?"
"Patrick","  The rest of me is up here."
"SpongeBob"," Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head. "
"Patrick"," I find all this laughter to be highly illogical."
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!  Go ahead, you get first crack."
"Patrick","  Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before."
"Patrick"," Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding."
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look buddy, I captured one!"
"Patrick"," Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. "
"SpongeBob"," OK...what do you wanna do?"
"Patrick"," Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature."
"SpongeBob"," Pretty."
"Patrick"," Yes, quite."
"SpongeBob"," Fragile."
"Patrick"," Indeed."
"SpongeBob","  C'mon Patrick, let's do something fun."
"Patrick"," Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?"
"SpongeBob"," I was thinking more like jumping rope , 1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. "
"Patrick"," Doesn't feel like fun."
"SpongeBob","  How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?"
"Squidward"," Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous.  Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. "
"SpongeBob"," Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?"
"Squidward"," I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob."
"SpongeBob"," See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidward. Hey, Sandy, what's this?"
"Sandy"," Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, that sounds fancy."
"Sandy"," Let me show you how it works. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!  Where'd it go?"
"Sandy"," Just where you think it would be. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?"
"Sandy"," I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo! "
"Sandy"," Hold on tight."
"SpongeBob","  Gee, Sandy, this sure feels..."
"Squidward","  Well, here we go again. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward! "
"Sandy"," What's going on with this thing?  What in tarnation? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy."
"Squidward"," I'm not sure what it is but I something seems different about me."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, me too."
"Squidward"," Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible. I have my clarinet recital tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever."
"Squidward","  Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated."
"Sandy"," Well, I wish I knew how."
"Squidward"," Well, you have to do something. I can't stay stuck to him."
"Sandy"," Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter."
"Squidward"," Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it."
"Sandy"," Well, here goes nothing. "
"Squidward"," It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same."
"Sandy"," Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage."
"Squidward"," Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this."
"Sandy"," I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up."
"SpongeBob"," Together forever."
"Squidward"," Misery.  SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I'll drive."
"Squidward","  Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What in blazes is going on in here?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you two doing laying around? Get to work."
"Squidward"," If you say so. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Egad. What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, cap'n."
"Squidward"," Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon."
"Squidward"," I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register.  Whew. Can I help you?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  Can't... reach the buns."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's the hold up?!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Time is money, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Time is money. Right.  Hello bun. At last we meet. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth.  And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out."
"SpongeBob"," Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other."
"Squidward"," That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. "
"Squidward"," Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us."
"Sandy"," Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'."
"Squidward"," Hello Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night."
"Sandy"," Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet."
"Squidward"," What'd you say?"
"Sandy"," I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? "
"Squidward"," What? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak.  Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show."
"Sandy"," Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. "
"Squidward"," Of course.  Oh, my.  Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar."
"Squidward"," Superstar?"
"SpongeBob"," Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen."
"Squidward"," You're right. The show must go on."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, hi."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, they really liked it."
"Mr. Krabs","  There you go, Squiddy."
"Squidward"," They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it  sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating."
"Sandy"," Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time."
"Sandy"," One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. "
"Squidward","  Hmph. "
"Squidward"," Huh, no wait. Wait!  Oh, my one moment of fame... gone.  There's got to be some way to reverse this. "
"Sandy"," No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I wouldn't--! "
"Squidward"," It all started when I was born. "
"SpongeBob"," So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So..."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," They weren't overcooked at all!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, look! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!"
"SpongeBob"," Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born."
"Squidward"," Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?"
"Squidward"," Where are all the new hotel employees? "
"Mr. Krabs"," My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request""."
"Mr. Krabs"," If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service."
"Squidward"," Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, Squidward, you man the front desk."
"Patrick"," I'd like a Krabby Patty, please."
"Squidward"," This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service."
"Patrick"," Ok, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?"
"Squidward"," Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?"
"Patrick"," Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!"
"Squidward","  Gimme that! Now sign the register."
"Patrick"," I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! "
"Squidward"," Patrick, all you have to do is write your name."
"Patrick"," Oh, ok.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done! "
"Squidward"," Close enough. Here's your room key."
"Patrick"," I'll need some help with my bags."
"Squidward"," How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!"
"Patrick"," This is a hotel?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Take Patrick and his bags to his room."
"Patrick"," What about my Krabby Patty?"
"Squidward"," And bring him a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. "
"Squidward"," Oh, Mr Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo."
"Squidward"," Fine. Let's go, Patrick. "
"Mr. Krabs","  This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. "
"Squidward"," What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?"
"Patrick"," I don't tell you how to live your life!"
"Squidward"," Well, here's your room."
"Patrick"," Wow."
"Squidward"," Enjoy your stay."
"Patrick"," Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from."
"SpongeBob"," Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock."
"Patrick"," Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man."
"SpongeBob"," Why, thank you, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What now?!"
"Patrick"," I don't like crusts on my sandwich!"
"Squidward"," It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?"
"Patrick"," Peel it."
"Squidward","  Happy? "
"SpongeBob"," Room service! Here's the 50 Krabby Patties you ordered."
"Patrick"," Could you do one more thing for me?"
"Squidward"," Why don't you ask SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," Good idea, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," How may I serve you, sir?"
"Patrick"," I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help."
"Squidward"," What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!"
"Squidward"," But Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there."
"Squidward"," A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!"
"Patrick"," Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean."
"Squidward"," That's it! I've had enough!"
"Patrick"," Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!"
"Squidward"," Not anymore. I quit. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!"
"Squidward"," One room, please. On the top floor."
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you think you're doing?"
"Squidward"," I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where ""we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request""."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't have to rent you a room!"
"Squidward"," I've got cash."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh... here's your room key."
"Squidward"," Spongebob, carry my things to my room."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, guest sir. "
"Squidward","  And you can carry me to my room."
"Mr. Krabs"," And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken."
"Squidward"," The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee."
"SpongeBob"," Your room, sir."
"Squidward"," And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hairs."
"Mr. Krabs","  You've got to be kidding me!"
"Squidward"," And I want it here in 5 seconds."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it."
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm not gonna eat this. You are."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!"
"SpongeBob"," Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hairs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese."
"Patrick","  Hooray!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What is it, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make."
"Mr. Krabs","  Here's your homemade cookies."
"Squidward","  These don't taste like anything mom used to make!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, how did your mother make 'em?"
"Squidward"," How should I know?! Ask my mother! "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," No good, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk..."
"SpongeBob"," There's room for you to sit up front!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well?"
"Squidward"," I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook."
"Mr. Krabs"," So you're all taken care of?"
"Squidward"," Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Squidward"," ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".  Perfect!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This room is exactly the same as when we started!"
"Squidward"," Nothing like getting back to the basics."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming."
"Mr. Krabs"," The pool's out back!"
"Squidward"," Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim.  Come on in, the water's fine. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?"
"Squidward"," Nope, that's it."
"Mr. Krabs"," You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!"
"Squidward"," No, I'm good."
"SpongeBob"," Me, too."
"Patrick"," Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy!  Cannonball! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start."
"Patrick"," That was a hotel?"
"Mr. Krabs"," $15,000?!"
"Squidward"," You're not gonna have a heart attack are you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!"
"Patrick"," This is a hospital?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!"
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob","  Seat-belt-aroony. One second. "
"SpongeBob"," Start the engine?"
"SpongeBob","  Now what do I do?"
"SpongeBob"," Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," I failed?"
"SpongeBob","  I got Mrs. Puff fired. "
"SpongeBob"," I am?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive "
"SpongeBob"," Ready for my test, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Crawl?"
"SpongeBob"," Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!"
"SpongeBob"," Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew! "
"SpongeBob"," How to drive, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Sir, yes, sir!"
"SpongeBob","  That'll be easy."
"SpongeBob"," Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge! "
"SpongeBob"," Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?"
"SpongeBob"," Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?"
"SpongeBob"," 1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13."
"SpongeBob"," Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir!  Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball.  Nice boy."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! Step 1 seatbelts. "
"SpongeBob"," Step 2 would be... ignite engine."
"SpongeBob"," Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold."
"SpongeBob"," But I can't do it without a blindfold."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, sir.  There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts."
"SpongeBob"," Man down. Man down.  Sorry, excuse me. Sorry."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!"
"Patrick"," My pants!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I can't see!  Did I pass?"
"Patrick","  The nerve of some people."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm ""unteachable""."
"SpongeBob"," I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.  I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time."
"SpongeBob"," Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops."
"Patrick"," Wow."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!"
"Patrick"," Let me try! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm."
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out."
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob","  Onward... to Squidward's house."
"Squidward"," Go away!"
"SpongeBob"," To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming."
"SpongeBob"," Who?"
"Sandy"," My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?"
"Sandy"," It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?"
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut. "
"Patrick"," What's it saying?"
"SpongeBob"," It's saying... ""It's dark in here."" Got anything else, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a hot, frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!"
"SpongeBob"," So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine."
"Sandy"," Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure."
"SpongeBob"," We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What'll we do?"
"SpongeBob"," They're looking for an invention, right?"
"Patrick"," Right."
"SpongeBob"," So let's start inventing!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," It's time to get serious, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with."
"SpongeBob"," That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented. "
"Patrick"," Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark."
"SpongeBob"," Light bulb, already invented. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe."
"SpongeBob"," That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented."
"Patrick"," Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything. "
"Sandy"," ♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here."
"Patrick"," Who?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!"
"Patrick"," I have no idea what you're talking about. "
"Patrick"," You guys talk funny. Say more words!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!"
"Patrick"," And I used to be dumb. "
"SpongeBob"," My name is SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," And I am Professor Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Professor?"
"Patrick"," Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are."
"SpongeBob"," She should be back any moment."
"Patrick"," I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Good idea."
"SpongeBob"," Well?"
"Patrick"," Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work. "
"SpongeBob"," Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!"
"Patrick"," Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene."
"Patrick"," As sure as I'm a doctor professor."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't you think we should test it?"
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," That's not exactly what I had in mind!"
"SpongeBob"," Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick."
"Patrick"," Thank you, lowly assistant."
"SpongeBob"," Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention."
"Patrick"," It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I really wish Sandy were here. "
"Sandy"," Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?"
"Sandy"," What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?! "
"Patrick"," It works! It works!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay."
"Sandy"," I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick."
"Patrick"," That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick."
"Sandy","  Don't push it."
"Patrick"," Sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!"
"Sandy"," Yeah. "
"Sandy"," I accept."
"Sandy"," Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption."
"Patrick"," My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!"
"SpongeBob"," The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward! Help! "
"Squidward"," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't believe in ghosts and I never liked you! "
"SpongeBob"," PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," It's OK, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Goodnight, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks."
"SpongeBob"," Eeeh."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all."
"SpongeBob"," You just gotta scare someone other than me."
"SpongeBob"," Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all."
"SpongeBob"," Sure, relax a little."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, champ! How's it... "
"SpongeBob"," What is going on around here?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! EVERYONE, GET OUT!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?"
"SpongeBob"," Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. "
"SpongeBob"," A journey into self-awareness. "
"SpongeBob"," Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious.  Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that's The Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action."
"SpongeBob","  Now he's got him."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems!  ...goblins...guilt trip... "
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," What's going on?"
"Squidward"," Mother?"
"Squidward","  Uh, Squiddums loves his mama."
"Squidward"," Ghosts?"
"Squidward"," There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? "
"Squidward"," No! No! That's impossible!  Ghosts! Ghosts!"
"SpongeBob","  Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!"
"SpongeBob"," And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon."
"SpongeBob"," Good Ol' Dutchie!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Neptune's trousers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a room on the ground floor?"
"Mr. Krabs","  It is?  Oh, I mean it is! Very special! Very very special, indeed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," None at all."
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew that! How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, we don't want that to happen."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh. Everybody brace for impact!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors--bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast."
"Mr. Krabs","  I promise."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy."
"SpongeBob"," What's this, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's me credit card. You use it instead of money."
"SpongeBob"," I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Exactly."
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work."
"SpongeBob"," Detective work--I'm going undercover."
"SpongeBob","  Angela likes Brad."
"SpongeBob","  I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. "
"SpongeBob"," Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it."
"SpongeBob"," That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, I bought the wrong present."
"SpongeBob"," Now this is obviously the greatest present ever."
"Squidward"," The banner's up, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale."
"Squidward"," I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  Isn't he dreamy? "
"Squidward"," I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor."
"Squidward"," Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'."
"Squidward"," Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're a real fan, huh?"
"Squidward"," Oh yeah, I know all their songs."
"Mr. Krabs"," All their songs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's almost time for the party to start!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm back, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?"
"SpongeBob"," The delivery truck will be here momentarily."
"Squidward"," Here she comes, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Everybody get into position. "
"Squidward"," It is dishwater. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who wants cake?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And frosting."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it. "
"Squidward"," Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, come back! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I did? I mean...I did?!"
"SpongeBob"," Just watch.  Hit it boys! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, how much is all this costing me?"
"SpongeBob"," Here's the receipt."
"Mr. Krabs","  I ought to..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh."
"SpongeBob"," You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't push your luck, boy."
"SpongeBob","  All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?"
"SpongeBob"," Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty."
"SpongeBob"," Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here. "
"SpongeBob"," Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special? "
"SpongeBob"," What could it be today, Gary?"
"SpongeBob","  A videotape?  ""You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants"". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! "
"SpongeBob"," King of Karate?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo! "
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate."
"Sandy"," Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there."
"Sandy"," But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe your karate  the best, but now they've recognized a new number one."
"Sandy"," There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up."
"SpongeBob"," All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?"
"Sandy"," Yup. That's it over there."
"SpongeBob"," What make you think that's Karate Island? "
"Sandy"," I don't know -- lucky guess? "
"SpongeBob"," Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you. "
"Sandy"," Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty."
"Sandy"," Oh, brother."
"SpongeBob"," You hear that, Sandy? He called me ""master."" Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders."
"SpongeBob"," Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?"
"Sandy"," Something smells like rancid rodeo around here. "
"SpongeBob"," The one and only."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready to be King of Karate! "
"SpongeBob"," My throne. "
"Sandy"," All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder."
"SpongeBob","  Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, ya'll are getting a bit wily."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back."
"SpongeBob","  But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you."
"Sandy"," I'm getting off this crazy train! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy's going to miss out, big time. "
"Sandy"," That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting - - and that ain't much."
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob's in trouble!  SpongeBob is the ""King of Karate"". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself."
"Sandy"," Hold on, buddy! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Sandy!"
"Sandy","  SpongeBob?"
"Sandy"," Huh? "
"Sandy"," Taste these! "
"Sandy"," No one can resist jelly-filled.  Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed."
"Sandy","  All right, who's next?"
"Sandy"," Advanced hair-dryer style!"
"Sandy"," That's enough lip out of you. "
"Sandy"," Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome."
"Sandy"," Release SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," What are you talking about?"
"Sandy"," You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean I'm not King of Karate?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't do it, Sandy! "
"Sandy","  I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!"
"Sandy"," You're in the soup now, Udon! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo."
"Sandy"," Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for."
"SpongeBob"," I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?"
"Sandy"," You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... "
"Squidward"," I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived! "
"Squidward"," Hmph, No one's ordered the monster patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster patty."
"SpongeBob","  Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!"
"Squidward"," Uhh, one monster Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh dear Neptune."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob","  We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we better get back to work."
"SpongeBob"," Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Use another spatular."
"SpongeBob","  WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming Spat!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Doctor."
"SpongeBob","  Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this. "
"SpongeBob"," OW!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry."
"SpongeBob"," I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? "
"SpongeBob","  How about now?"
"SpongeBob","  Now?"
"SpongeBob","  Now?"
"SpongeBob","  Now?"
"SpongeBob","  Now?"
"SpongeBob"," Now?"
"SpongeBob","  That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?"
"SpongeBob"," Evening, sir. Hey, Granny, what's shakin?  Ooh, breezy today."
"Squidward","  Nice outfit, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny."
"Mr. Krabs"," What’s all the lallygagging about?"
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," This better be good. "
"SpongeBob"," Soon everyone will know of your beauty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... don't you have any shame, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what can it do?"
"Squidward"," Can it make me famous?"
"SpongeBob"," Anything you want and more. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, that sounds excitin'. Let me have a go at it. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do."
"Mr. Krabs","  What? Are you going against your commanding officer?"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master."
"Mr. Krabs"," With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob","  One Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?"
"SpongeBob"," But, but, I thought we were friends."
"SpongeBob"," Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. "
"SpongeBob"," Spatula?? It can't be true. It's too late! "
"SpongeBob"," I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. Hes gone! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm so sorry. "
"SpongeBob","  Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry-y-y-y! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! "
"SpongeBob","   All that glitters is not gold. "
"SpongeBob"," Good-bye, best friend!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us."
"Squidward"," One monster Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Nothing. Oh well.  That sounds like a quarter crying for help.  Come to papa!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it?  Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one...  I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole!  Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you!  Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big."
"Mr. Krabs"," No!  I'll save ya, money!  Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And then what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?"
"SpongeBob"," You can't rush perfection."
"Squidward"," I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you."
"SpongeBob","  Always the kidder, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches."
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya.  X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well."
"SpongeBob"," A wishing well, here? Wow!"
"Squidward"," Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?"
"Squidward"," No, I don't, and neither does Mr Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true.  What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?"
"Squidward"," To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. ♪Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...♪"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.♪"
"Squidward"," I'm not cryin'!  Ow. Ow."
"SpongeBob"," ♪When you throw all your dreams down the well.♪  Well, Squidward, what do you think?"
"Squidward"," That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's beautiful.  You smell that boys? That's the smell of money."
"SpongeBob"," You mean magic, don't ya?"
"Squidward"," All I can smell is that dumpster. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register."
"Squidward"," As long as there's no singing."
"SpongeBob"," And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta."
"SpongeBob"," A promotion?  Why do I have to go down in the well?"
"Mr. Krabs"," To collect the money!"
"SpongeBob"," How long do I have to stay down here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," See ya in 8 hours."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here. "
"Sandy"," I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale."
"SpongeBob"," Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes... "
"Plankton"," I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, née my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh...  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Oh my gosh. Who said that?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," How do you know my name?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish."
"Patrick"," Ok, magical talking trashcan.  I wish SpongeBob were here to see this. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick."
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it."
"Patrick"," But I got my wish."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we've got 6½ hours till the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?"
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"SpongeBob","  Tag, you're it."
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"SpongeBob","  Tag, you're it. "
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"SpongeBob","  Tag, you're it."
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"SpongeBob","  Tag, you're it."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?"
"SpongeBob"," I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures."
"Patrick"," And I fell on my head."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money. "
"SpongeBob"," This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, sure, whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Can we come out now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪  Holy mackerel, look Patrick! We've struck magic."
"Patrick"," Is that good?"
"SpongeBob"," Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done."
"Patrick"," It's the only thing I've ever done."
"Squidward"," Having fun down there, SpongeBob? "
"Patrick"," Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better."
"SpongeBob"," Do you wanna make a wish?"
"Squidward","  I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me."
"SpongeBob"," Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic."
"Squidward","  There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing well's are just a scam to fool saps like you. "
"SpongeBob"," No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party."
"Patrick"," Party!"
"Squidward"," Let me out of here."
"SpongeBob"," We were just gonna play some party games."
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"SpongeBob","  Tag, you're it."
"Patrick","  Tag, you're it."
"Squidward"," I gotta get out of here. "
"Squidward"," There's not way to climb out of here."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe if you had more upper arm strength."
"Patrick"," Yeah, you should work out more."
"Squidward"," Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here. "
"Patrick"," I don't get it."
"Squidward"," Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic."
"Patrick"," What does claustrophobic mean?"
"SpongeBob"," It means he's afraid of Santa Claus."
"Squidward"," No, it doesn't."
"Patrick"," Ho, ho, ho! "
"SpongeBob"," Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!"
"Patrick"," Ho, ho, ho!"
"Squidward"," It's not working, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Darn."
"SpongeBob"," Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot."
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry, SpongeBob."
"Patrick","  And you got your elbow in my ribs."
"Squidward"," Eww. Patrick!"
"Patrick","  And stop stepping in my potato salad."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, hey, hey, guys."
"Squidward","  Stop pushing me, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, you mean like this? "
"Squidward"," No, like this! "
"SpongeBob","  You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place. "
"Squidward"," Patrick, get off of me!  I told you I am claustrophobic!"
"Patrick"," Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here."
"Squidward"," Patrick! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money. "
"Squidward"," Free. I'm free!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?"
"Squidward"," The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here.  Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!"
"Patrick","  Lucky. "
"Mr. Krabs"," So how much money did you make last night?"
"SpongeBob"," We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic."
"Mr. Krabs"," The what?"
"SpongeBob"," We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it.  What in the deep blue is that?"
"Sandy"," There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?"
"SpongeBob"," That's great, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," That wishing well sure does work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just a coincidence. "
"SpongeBob"," It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin? "
"SpongeBob"," See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat."
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean she stole that boat."
"Plankton","  Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day. "
"SpongeBob"," Is that proof enough for ya?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya.  I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no! "
"Plankton","  I surrender!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work."
"Plankton"," There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me."
"Plankton"," Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?"
"Plankton"," Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?"
"Plankton"," What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer."
"Plankton"," Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?"
"Plankton"," No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up."
"Mr. Krabs","  Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?"
"Plankton"," I'm serious, Krabs. Soon the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down."
"Plankton"," Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. "
"SpongeBob"," What's going on Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled."
"SpongeBob"," Whatever you say, cap'n. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise? "
"Plankton"," Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Mr Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf."
"SpongeBob"," That's some good news, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Right away, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's party!   Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"Squidward"," This is idiotic."
"Mr. Krabs"," Dance or you're fired."
"Squidward"," You got it, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs","  How do you like them apples, you little... "
"Plankton","  Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. "
"Plankton"," Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me."
"Plankton"," Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Grr..."
"Plankton"," But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items."
"Mr. Krabs"," Bubkes."
"Plankton"," Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways."
"Mr. Krabs"," Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it."
"Plankton"," Thanks, but no."
"Mr. Krabs"," A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?"
"Plankton"," Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine."
"Mr. Krabs"," Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! See?! Who's the one with the problem?!"
"Plankton"," Look what you've done. This is my livelihood."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. "
"Plankton","  GET OUT!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops."
"Plankton"," What's this?  Hey, Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew you'd come back."
"Plankton"," You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! "
"Plankton"," Coming, coming.  Yo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Eugene?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, hey."
"Plankton"," Hey."
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?"
"Plankton"," Yes. I'm still here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?"
"Plankton"," Sure. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Glad you could make it, buddy."
"Plankton"," So, what's this about, Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over."
"Plankton"," Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%."
"Plankton"," Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something."
"Plankton"," Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula."
"Plankton"," I can't believe you would even think..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me."
"Plankton"," You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, take it."
"Plankton"," You sure?  Life is good, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure is buddy. Sure is. "
"Plankton"," Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. "
"Squidward"," What a sun-tastic day!  Snail trail.  That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him."
"Squidward"," Not my pet rock collection.  That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook it will be the last time!  This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Hey, SpongeBob...  Keep your shell vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster...  He bit me!"
"SpongeBob","  Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you."
"Squidward"," Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mutt."
"SpongeBob"," Gary's not misbehaved!"
"SpongeBob"," But there does appear to be something wrong with him."
"Squidward"," I'll say. I hope he had his shots."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, of course."
"Squidward"," All of his shots?"
"SpongeBob"," Affirmatory."
"Squidward"," For rabies?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup."
"Squidward"," Snail pox and soft shell dance?"
"SpongeBob"," Yupie."
"Squidward"," Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup, yup, yup."
"Patrick","  Well, let's not forget the worst of them all Mad Snail Disease."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh..."
"Patrick"," You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?  Looks like the rash has already started."
"Squidward"," Rash?"
"Patrick"," Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?"
"Squidward","  Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry."
"Patrick"," This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into... A zombie."
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick","  You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important.  There's a mad snail on the loose! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!"
"Patrick","  That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie."
"Squidward"," Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms."
"SpongeBob","  Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction."
"Squidward","  I'm a zombie, here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh.  It's locked!  Somebody let me in."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?"
"SpongeBob"," Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, it's you."
"SpongeBob"," That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right."
"Patrick"," Or is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombie-fied. Just look at how yellow he is."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet? "
"Patrick"," Perhaps not. Now, I got my eye on you!"
"Patrick"," You're right.  I'm a zombie!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy."
"SpongeBob"," All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail.  Gary...  How could you?"
"SpongeBob"," No, don't hurt him."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's... for his own good, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," No, I won't let you touch Gary."
"Patrick"," Yeah. What do you know about it?"
"SpongeBob"," S.D.E. and S.E.?"
"Patrick"," Well, does that mean we're not zombies?"
"SpongeBob","  Easy boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?"
"SpongeBob"," Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?"
"Squidward"," Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All's well that ends well."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ow! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery."
"SpongeBob"," Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. "
"SpongeBob"," Time off?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that went better than expected."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward."
"Squidward"," I thought you were on vacation."
"Mr. Krabs","  He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy."
"SpongeBob"," What's a vacation?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work."
"SpongeBob","  No work?! But what'll I do all day?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here."
"SpongeBob"," But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone."
"Squidward"," Nor will I."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement."
"Patrick","  Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day."
"Mr. Krabs"," Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here."
"SpongeBob"," Replacement?"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's enough banter on my dime."
"Patrick"," Ok, boss."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. "
"Patrick"," Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation."
"SpongeBob"," I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! "
"Squidward"," Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not here to see you, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick."
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker."
"SpongeBob"," You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, it's not what you think."
"Mr. Krabs","  Out you go, boy."
"SpongeBob"," But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. "
"Squidward","  I need 20 Krabby Patties, please."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming..."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. "
"Squidward"," Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. "
"Patrick"," Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, shhh."
"Patrick"," It talks! "
"SpongeBob"," Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not a problem at all, me boy."
"SpongeBob"," Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," My house is back that way, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs"," Far out, little man. Far out. "
"SpongeBob"," Where'd you say you were taking me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me! Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! "
"Patrick"," Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? Is that you?"
"SpongeBob","  I've been waiting for you, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! "
"Squidward"," One shell on a shingle. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why'd you do it, laddy?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore."
"SpongeBob"," You must've saved a fortune."
"Mr. Krabs"," Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! That's more than I make in a year."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work."
"SpongeBob","  Yippee! I happily acquiesce."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready! I'm ready, I'm rea...  Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture,  itchy scalp...  it's a wig!  Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?"
"Patrick","  I'll save you. "
"SpongeBob"," Pa... trick... what are... you doing?"
"Patrick"," I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!"
"Patrick","  Oh, sorry."
"SpongeBob"," It's ok.  Why did you do that?"
"Patrick","  Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea."
"Patrick"," Then what is it?"
"SpongeBob"," It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig."
"Patrick"," A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind? "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks. I am very fashionable today."
"SpongeBob"," Why, thank you."
"SpongeBob","  Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Who? What? Where? What? How?"
"SpongeBob"," Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?"
"Squidward"," Nope."
"SpongeBob"," I'm wearing a wig."
"Squidward"," Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?"
"SpongeBob"," Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?"
"Squidward"," Umm...maybe."
"SpongeBob"," If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you."
"Squidward"," I can't wait."
"SpongeBob"," Wig away!  Order up, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties."
"SpongeBob"," Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Happy?"
"SpongeBob"," Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can imagine."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy"," There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice? "
"SpongeBob"," I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?"
"Sandy"," Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Glad you like it.  I'll see you later, Sandy.  Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good."
"SpongeBob"," You know it."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs."
"SpongeBob"," This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me."
"Squidward"," Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Time to go home, boys."
"SpongeBob","  Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too."
"Squidward"," It's about as functional as your brain."
"SpongeBob","  Thank you, Squidward."
"Squidward"," That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't understand."
"Squidward","  Just look at yourself."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, handsome.  Sss."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before."
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, I've never been tall before."
"Squidward"," That wig is infested with parasites. "
"SpongeBob"," That tickles."
"Squidward"," Can't you see how ridiculous you look?"
"SpongeBob"," I think that it looks cool."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer. "
"SpongeBob"," For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs"," No but's."
"SpongeBob"," So I can't have a wig or a butt?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt out of here. "
"Sandy"," I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard.  SpongeBob? Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy. What do you think?"
"Sandy"," We need to talk. "
"SpongeBob"," Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. "
"Sandy"," Well, it does attract a lot of attention."
"SpongeBob"," I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me."
"Sandy"," Neither can I, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.  and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me."
"SpongeBob"," Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! "
"Sandy"," Umm, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie."
"Sandy"," Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen. [all talking at once. We can hear some of them. Fish #1 says ""Take it off, jerk!"". Fish #2 says ""Hey!"". Fish #3 says ""Hey! Down in front!"". Fish #4 says ""Take the wig off!""."
"SpongeBob"," People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy"," Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too."
"Sandy"," It's time to be strong."
"SpongeBob"," I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!"
"Sandy"," Hurry up, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again."
"Sandy"," You did the right thing, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig."
"Patrick"," Look at my new wig. "
"SpongeBob"," Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool."
"SpongeBob"," Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?"
"SpongeBob"," I wish I had a wig. "
"Patrick"," Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!"
"SpongeBob"," Ocean wave.  Tropical breeze."
"Patrick"," Whirlpool."
"SpongeBob"," Reverse Whirlpool."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, turn that noise off!  This'll get his attention."
"SpongeBob"," Oh!  Oh."
"Squidward"," Sponge..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, you've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it."
"Squidward"," No!  No!  Don't...  touch...  me!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll get a better look.  Mm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures.  Got it! Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing."
"Squidward"," It's called a reeeee! "
"SpongeBob"," What's a  reeeee?"
"Squidward"," Great.  My reed...  is still...  stuck in my...  throat.  And it's all your fault. "
"SpongeBob","  There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy."
"Sandy","  Hmm.  Just as I thought.  You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was  clumsy of you."
"Squidward"," I didn't. It was SpongeBob who..."
"Sandy"," Well, there's nothing to do for it, but surgery."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh!"
"Sandy"," Now is my chance to try out my new invention-- The solution to your problem."
"Squidward"," A submarine?"
"Sandy"," That's right, Squidward. Let me show you.  This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.  I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size..  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!"
"Squidward"," Why don't you just shrink the reed?"
"Sandy"," Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way  We're all set, Squidward! Are you ready for the sedative?"
"Squidward"," Are you sure this is safe?"
"Sandy"," Completely! As long as someone competent is behind the wheel. Hey, what's that?  Hi-yah! Sweet dreams, partner. Oops! I forgot to pack food for the trip. I've got to get some supplies from my treedome, and I need you to guard the submarine while I'm gone.  Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut- hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hell,o citizen."
"Patrick"," What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Guarding Sandy's submarine."
"Patrick"," Wow! I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside."
"SpongeBob"," Can't. I'm guarding it."
"Patrick"," Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right!  Patrick, you're a genius!"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty. "
"Patrick"," Hmm.  ""Shrink."" I do have a lot of issues."
"Sandy"," I'm back, SpongeBob.  Uh-oh."
"Patrick"," You're so tiny. He shrinks even smaller than SpongeBob.] A giant SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," Patrick! SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," Sandy's grown to gigantic size!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk."
"Patrick"," That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?"
"Sandy"," Hi, Squidward.  Well, the submarine is safely inside you."
"Squidward"," Wonderful. Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?"
"Sandy"," Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and..."
"Sandy"," You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important."
"SpongeBob","  Where are we, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  I don't know, but it's a real dump."
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, Patrick, can you hear me?"
"SpongeBob"," It's Sandy."
"Patrick"," She's in there?  I'll save you, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, where are you? Where are we?"
"Sandy"," You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing  inside of Squidward."
"Patrick"," I thought this place was in bad shape."
"Squidward","  I heard that!"
"Sandy","  Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point."
"SpongeBob"," Um...we broke it."
"Sandy"," Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?"
"Sandy","  This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile, which you've never successfully done.  So, just take it nice and easy."
"SpongeBob"," No problemo. Nice and...easy!"
"Squidward"," So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!"
"Sandy"," Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!"
"Squidward"," Okay, now what is this?"
"Sandy"," Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous."
"Squidward"," Oh, of course. I've got  head shots, you know.  What the..."
"Sandy"," Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What's happening? "
"SpongeBob"," Give me that!"
"Patrick"," No, give it back!"
"Sandy"," They're hitting your central nervous system!"
"Squidward"," Oh. Ya think?"
"Sandy"," You're not in control of your actions!  Hey!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions."
"Sandy"," They've gone off course!  Oh my gosh! You're out of control!"
"SpongeBob"," Ew! Where are we?   Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming!"
"Sandy"," The stomach acid levels are way too high!"
"SpongeBob"," The reserve tanks are almost empty.  Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Finished."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there! It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is!  You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel.  Like natural gas."
"SpongeBob"," Natural gas?"
"Patrick"," Like this!"
"Squidward"," Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!"
"Sandy"," Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Sandy"," If you can make a big enough burp..."
"Patrick"," We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Sandy"," He's right."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Sandy"," We're going through with your plan, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay!"
"Patrick"," What plan?"
"Sandy"," Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!"
"SpongeBob"," I never thought it would end this way.  It's working!"
"Sandy"," They're headed for the esophagus.  Phew, what have you been eating?"
"Squidward"," Morons."
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction."
"Sandy"," Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow."
"SpongeBob"," I'm already on it."
"SpongeBob"," This stupid hammer won't break anything."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin! "
"Sandy","  Good work, guys. Mission accomplished.  Now all you have to do is..."
"Squidward"," Get out of my body! Go!"
"Patrick"," Grow?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Almost ready to open.  There."
"Squidward"," Good morning, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you? "
"SpongeBob","  Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs."
"Patrick","  Squidward, the toilet's backed up again."
"Patrick"," Uh, me?"
"Patrick"," I gotta get out of town!  Oh, thanks SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Sure, Patrick, ya... "
"Patrick"," I gotta get going! He told me to!"
"SpongeBob"," Who did?"
"Patrick"," Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin!  But, Patrick, you can't go. Not like this. Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo? "
"Patrick"," It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set. "
"SpongeBob"," Unset it, please unset it! "
"Patrick"," I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go.  My clothes."
"SpongeBob"," Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes."
"Patrick","  My peanut butter!"
"SpongeBob"," That's my peanut butter."
"Patrick"," And my pickles! "
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick.  With all my pickles!"
"Patrick","  It's the end of me. Being here."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Stop! What about all our plans?  800am - Wake up Patrick, 900am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 1000am - Brush Teeth with Patrick, 100pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me?"
"Patrick"," I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob","  But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?"
"Patrick"," Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?"
"SpongeBob"," You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long."
"Patrick"," Huh?  There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you.  Patrick, you okay? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder."
"Patrick","  Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave.  Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral.  YOW!  Goodbye seaweed."
"SpongeBob"," Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume.  Hmmm..."
"Patrick"," Goodbye sky. "
"SpongeBob"," That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a..."
"Patrick"," Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. "
"Patrick"," D'oh!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be.  You're all set. Come on out, Patrick. "
"SpongeBob"," The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia. "
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat..."
"SpongeBob"," ...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia! "
"SpongeBob"," Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a..."
"SpongeBob"," But she's not my girlfriend."
"SpongeBob"," C'mon, Patricia. "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work. "
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours."
"Mr. Krabs","  There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh?  SpongeBob, who's your friend?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia."
"Mr. Krabs","  Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," We do? Great, she can start right away. "
"Squidward"," He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee."
"Squidward"," Well, she sure is stunning. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Just keep your eyes on the customers, Mr. Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you.  Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Order up, Miss Patricia."
"Mr. Krabs","  This order goes to table 7 and remember your manners. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's a 7, Patricia. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself.  I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made."
"SpongeBob"," Quite an appetite, but she's all woman. "
"Squidward"," Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing.  So, are you free this Saturday night?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Get back to work, you gold-bricking freeloader. Hut two, hut two, yah, yah! And don't come back 'til all the patties are krabby.  Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a..."
"Squidward"," Are you sure about Saturday night? "
"Mr. Krabs"," How about Sunday brunch?"
"Squidward"," But I made reservations for two at..."
"SpongeBob"," But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Patrick?"
"SpongeBob","  The assassin."
"SpongeBob"," I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town."
"SpongeBob","  Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price."
"Squidward"," Umm, I think I need to take a shower."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?"
"Patrick"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list? "
"Squidward"," It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. "
"Patrick"," Do it again. Do it again."
"SpongeBob"," Ok. "
"Squidward"," Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television. "
"Patrick"," Do it again, do it again."
"Squidward"," If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! "
"Squidward"," You're still there, aren't you? "
"SpongeBob"," Good evening, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?"
"Patrick"," Yeah. We're here... "
"Squidward"," Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point? "
"Patrick"," Could you turn it up?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?"
"Patrick"," Squidward, what's this about?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, how come he's so emotional?"
"Patrick"," Is he the bad guy?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Squidward?"
"Squidward","  That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV. "
"Patrick"," Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny."
"Squidward"," I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields. "
"SpongeBob"," What is that thing, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I dunno. Let's get a closer look. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him."
"Patrick"," Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered."
"SpongeBob"," Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl."
"Patrick"," And some kibble. "
"SpongeBob"," You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly, meet Gary.  Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary. "
"Patrick"," I don't think Gary likes Smelly."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here."
"Patrick"," Ah! He can come home with me."
"SpongeBob"," That's a great idea, Patrick. You always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly, have fun at Patrick's. "
"Patrick"," No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back. Smelly!"
"SpongeBob","  Hmmm, what's all the commotion? "
"SpongeBob"," Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal."
"SpongeBob"," Smelly. "
"SpongeBob"," This isn't good."
"Patrick"," You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard."
"SpongeBob"," No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Ok, Patrick, remember the plan?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah.  This one, right?"
"SpongeBob","  No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison."
"Patrick","  Mmm, good plan."
"SpongeBob","  All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. "
"Patrick"," You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah! "
"SpongeBob"," Shh, we'll get caught."
"Patrick"," What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! "
"SpongeBob","  Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free! "
"SpongeBob"," Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," I'll let Smelly go first. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. "
"Patrick"," I think we lost them."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. "
"Patrick"," Hey, I see light."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. "
"Patrick","  I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. "
"Squidward","  Um... hi."
"SpongeBob","  Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming! "
"SpongeBob"," Popcorn is served! "
"SpongeBob","  I want to impress and amaze my friends!"
"SpongeBob","  Here it is Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill."
"Squidward"," Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz.  Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten."
"SpongeBob"," Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!"
"Squidward"," Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1..."
"Squidward","  This can't possibly end soon."
"SpongeBob"," Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist Mister Magic. "
"Squidward","  I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here. "
"SpongeBob"," Then take one card and shove it in your ear. "
"SpongeBob"," And finally, say the words ""Hobris-Pobris"".  Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice-cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form.  Presto!  Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam!  Abracadabra.  Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward.  I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible.  Whoa oh!  Speak to me. Speak!  Hey Squid, are you okay?  Hey Squid, are you still okay?  Hey Squidward, I got something for you! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer.  Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy."
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?"
"SpongeBob"," I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert."
"Patrick"," That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," It's all my fault."
"Patrick"," Did you say frozen dessert? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. "
"Patrick"," Oh...soft serve. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  Pat...!"
"Patrick"," But he's so tasty! "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!?  This isn't just your ordinary ice-cream cone."
"Patrick"," It's pistachio."
"SpongeBob","  No! It's Squidward!  And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged.  Patrick! Squidward has Melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?!  It's all your fault!  Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!"
"Patrick","  Warning From ages 9 to 99."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us Mister Magic!  Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person."
"SpongeBob"," It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice-cream. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back."
"SpongeBob"," I need your help to change him back."
"SpongeBob","  But if you don't my friend will be a cone forever."
"SpongeBob"," I'll wait."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, please."
"SpongeBob"," But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing."
"Patrick"," Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you Mister Magic?"
"SpongeBob"," Does that mean you can't change my friend back?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways!  You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. "
"SpongeBob","  What are we going to do about Squidward?"
"Patrick"," We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry. "
"SpongeBob"," Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... "
"Squidward"," Ew.  What are you doing, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked.  I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? "
"Squidward"," Hey, stop!  Get me out of here!"
"Patrick","  Hey SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?"
"Patrick"," Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hey, learning tastes good."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I needed those."
"Patrick"," Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone."
"SpongeBob"," 57 times."
"Patrick"," Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner."
"SpongeBob"," I'm a winner?"
"Patrick"," Who's a winner?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm a winner."
"Patrick"," Who's a winner?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm a winner."
"Patrick"," Who's a winner?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! "
"Patrick"," How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license."
"SpongeBob"," I didn't get a license, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Are they gonna mail it to you?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all."
"Patrick"," No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged."
"SpongeBob"," Let's just go home, Patrick."
"Patrick"," We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself."
"SpongeBob","  No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. "
"Patrick"," Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. No!"
"Patrick"," You're not the judge of me."
"SpongeBob"," I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm here for you, buddy."
"Patrick"," I passed my test!"
"SpongeBob"," You got a perfect score?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I thought you said it was hard."
"SpongeBob"," Perfect score. "
"Patrick"," Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. "
"Patrick","  How do I look?"
"SpongeBob","  Like a winner."
"Patrick"," Ready. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," Does that mean I get a free key chain?"
"Patrick"," Oh."
"Patrick"," Yeah! All right!"
"Patrick"," Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat."
"SpongeBob"," I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!"
"Patrick"," The horn works.  Whoo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license."
"Patrick"," Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license."
"SpongeBob"," Two millionth?"
"Patrick"," Then you can get a free boat just like me."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, just like you."
"Patrick"," I try to serve as an inspiration to others."
"SpongeBob"," Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours."
"Patrick"," I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the ride, Patrick."
"Patrick"," No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 300 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. "
"SpongeBob"," 400?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," You will never guess what happen to me today."
"SpongeBob"," You got your license."
"Patrick"," Yeah!  But that's not all."
"SpongeBob"," You got a new boat."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired. "
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. "
"Patrick"," Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the ride."
"Patrick"," No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. "
"SpongeBob"," That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru."
"SpongeBob"," When did we get a drive-thru?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams."
"SpongeBob"," I used to have a dream."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living."
"SpongeBob","  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— "
"Patrick"," The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What's with the helmet, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. "
"Patrick"," Boy, driving is so easy."
"SpongeBob"," Oh?"
"Patrick"," Do you want me to give you lessons?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, that would be great."
"Patrick"," Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy."
"Patrick"," What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it."
"SpongeBob"," Mom!"
"Patrick"," Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides."
"SpongeBob"," Hey. "
"Patrick"," Let's see what this baby can do. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph."
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah."
"SpongeBob","  40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. "
"Patrick"," What? Where? Who?"
"SpongeBob"," Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran 3 red lights!"
"Patrick"," So?"
"SpongeBob"," You're suppose to stop!"
"Patrick"," I think the driving genius knows what he's doing!"
"SpongeBob","  Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!"
"Patrick"," They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?"
"SpongeBob"," I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!"
"Patrick"," How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!"
"SpongeBob"," If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!"
"Patrick"," I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! "
"Patrick"," Litterbug?! No! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what do you think you're doing?"
"Patrick"," I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. "
"Patrick"," So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him."
"SpongeBob"," What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy."
"Patrick"," Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, then what do we do with this? "
"Patrick"," How's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Patrick"," Ready, buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Ready, pal.  Whoo! Whoo!"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"Patrick","  I know exactly who you are! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gar-Gar."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," I have to get rid of these books! "
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Patrick"," I'll show you why.  See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books.  Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means..."
"SpongeBob"," Small portion meals?"
"Patrick"," Exactly! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man.  Hi there."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this ""alleged"" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. "
"Patrick","  Ooh, what is it?  This is the worst-tasting gift ever!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick, that's great!"
"Patrick"," What is?"
"SpongeBob"," That you're king!"
"Patrick"," What's a king?"
"SpongeBob"," When you're a king, you can get anything you want."
"Patrick"," Anything I want?  SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?"
"SpongeBob"," Your wish is my command, your majesty.  Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king. "
"Patrick"," King needs food badly."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this all ab...  Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," The king would like..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy."
"Patrick"," I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king."
"Patrick","  Tasty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How about you pay the check, instead?"
"Patrick"," Oh sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free."
"Mr. Krabs"," All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king! "
"Patrick"," Are you gonna eat that?"
"Patrick"," I want it. "
"Patrick"," Tell him, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about."
"Patrick"," I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?"
"SpongeBob","  Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you."
"Patrick"," Good! Now tell him."
"SpongeBob"," Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants. "
"Patrick"," Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it."
"Patrick"," No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!"
"Patrick","  I love being king."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sire?"
"Patrick","  I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool? "
"Squidward"," Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect. "
"Patrick"," Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect. "
"Squidward","  My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick. What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard."
"Patrick"," Your front yard?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel."
"Squidward"," Ferris Wheel?"
"SpongeBob"," I know, isn't it great?"
"Squidward"," No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?"
"Patrick","  Uh..."
"Squidward"," You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe."
"Squidward"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?"
"Squidward"," See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!"
"Patrick","  Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, right away, your majesty. Umm, Squidward?"
"Squidward","  What?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?"
"Squidward","  Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty! "
"Patrick","  My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what's happened to you?"
"Patrick"," I don't know what you mean."
"SpongeBob"," Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and..."
"Patrick"," And what..."
"SpongeBob","  Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk."
"Patrick"," Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power."
"SpongeBob"," Uh...well, I..."
"Patrick","  Who's saying I'm abusing my POWER!?!  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is treason! All these kingly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself! "
"Patrick"," Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?"
"Patrick"," Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster."
"Patrick"," No. Uh-uh."
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!"
"SpongeBob","  La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The ""Ild Ones""! That's a strange name.  Scallop!!  Bye ""Ild Ones."" I like your silly name. Hmm...""w."" Oh, oh, they're not the ""Ild Ones."" They must be the ""Wild Ones."""
"SpongeBob"," No; I don't know who you are, either."
"SpongeBob"," Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?"
"SpongeBob"," There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?"
"SpongeBob"," Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you going on about? Bikers?"
"SpongeBob"," The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, this is serious! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Yes, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," A horrible biker gang called the ""Wild Ones"" are coming. We've got to run, hide! "
"Squidward","  Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Squidward"," Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around. "
"SpongeBob"," Like this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," That's it. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hello, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick"," Huh."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I heard you. But what I didn't hear was a hello."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hello, SpongeBob. Bloodthirsty bikers! We got to hide! "
"Patrick","  Hide me!"
"SpongeBob","  No, hide me!"
"Patrick","  Hide me!"
"SpongeBob","  Me!"
"Patrick","  No, me!"
"SpongeBob","  Me!"
"Patrick","  Me!"
"SpongeBob","  Me!"
"Patrick"," No! No more running."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants. "
"SpongeBob","  And their leather socks."
"Patrick"," If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads."
"SpongeBob"," Say that again, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Little baby doody-heads?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?"
"Patrick"," I wouldn't mess with ya."
"SpongeBob"," Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here."
"Patrick","  See?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's your salivation."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?"
"Squidward"," Does that part include laughing at you? Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual."
"SpongeBob"," Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?"
"Patrick"," I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See Squidward? We walk the walk but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?"
"Squidward"," No, I don't."
"Patrick"," What about our biker club?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," How about our biker organization?"
"Squidward"," No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships."
"SpongeBob"," What about our coalition?"
"Patrick"," Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive."
"SpongeBob","  We'll just pencil you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone."
"Mr. Krabs"," This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again."
"SpongeBob"," Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish."
"SpongeBob"," Then can we save the town?"
"Squidward"," Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the ""Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law"" tag on my mattress! Hide me. Hide me!  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind!  Oh. Thanks, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits."
"SpongeBob","  Me? Annoying?  Yeah right."
"Squidward"," You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon."
"Squidward"," What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we..."
"Squidward"," Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming! "
"Squidward","  Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live."
"SpongeBob"," Mild Ones?  Oh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you want to spend any money?"
"SpongeBob"," Good-bye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self. "
"Squidward"," Would you like a drink with that order?"
"Squidward"," That comes out to two dollars even."
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Why not?  All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good."
"Mr. Krabs"," KelpShake?"
"SpongeBob"," Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake.  Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill."
"Mr. Krabs"," Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule No outside drinks. No exceptions! "
"Squidward"," That's telling them."
"Mr. Krabs"," Grr. I better get to the bottom of this.  Ah! A new store!  On my block! Taking my customers.  Pearl.  Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm talking about this. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see that. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why I wouldn't give them a cent."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then you do understand. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret?  Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!"
"Plankton"," Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then how do you explain this? "
"Plankton"," Holy Moley, how'd that happen?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business."
"Plankton"," Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job!  Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formula."
"Plankton"," No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh!"
"Plankton","  They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner."
"Mr. Krabs"," Block after block."
"Plankton"," They're everywhere."
"Mr. Krabs","  We've got to do something about this.  You sure this is going to work?"
"Plankton"," Just stick to the plan."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are.  Plankton, I think I found the kitchen."
"Plankton"," Let's do this thing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here goes. Wa-choo!  I'm sorry, I have a bit of a  ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!! "
"Plankton","  My eye, my eye, my eye! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?"
"Plankton"," Of course I do. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All set, Plankton?"
"Plankton"," You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy.  What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage.  Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!"
"Mr. Krabs","  If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself.  Oh, me back. "
"Plankton","  Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course we do."
"SpongeBob"," Then why is he in your fist? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door."
"Plankton"," Now we have to fix the roof. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, good luck with that. See ya. "
"Plankton"," Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say... "
"Plankton"," Let's beat it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No kidding. "
"Plankton"," Wait, you forgotten...  I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that suppose to mean?"
"Plankton"," I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Buy one? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know about this, Plankton."
"Plankton"," It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money."
"Plankton"," Good luck."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, ok. "
"Plankton"," Release your grip, man. Do it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks.  I can't believe we did it."
"Plankton"," Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of.  What's the secret ingredient, Karen?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!"
"Plankton"," You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff."
"Mr. Krabs","  No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine."
"Plankton"," Not if I can help it.  Ow."
"Mr. Krabs","  Nice try. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it.  What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock."
"Plankton"," Really? Let me try that.  Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm.  Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad.  This is amazing."
"Plankton"," Well, don't be selfish.  Oh yeah."
"Plankton","  Krabs, we're all out of juice."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we gotta get more."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about.  KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake."
"SpongeBob","  What's happening to me?  They've shutdown the KelpShake restaurants! "
"Plankton"," Look at us!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now what are we going to do?"
"Plankton"," I don't know about you,  but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!"
"Plankton","  Come to papa. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere... without a ten second head start."
"Plankton"," It's good to be home."
"Mr. Krabs"," You said it."
"Plankton","  I love being hated."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, get back here you little booger! "
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one! "
"Patrick"," Uhh, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever."
"Patrick"," Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. "
"SpongeBob"," Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world."
"Patrick"," Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. "
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, right. Pants."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! "
"SpongeBob"," Put one over there, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I'm all done."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should spread out a little. "
"SpongeBob"," Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Reward? How much we talkin' about?"
"SpongeBob"," 12 dollars and...  ...38 cents."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm on the case. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Hello? Hello?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, did you get your net back?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!"
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I found your net!"
"SpongeBob"," What! Really?"
"Patrick"," Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?"
"SpongeBob","  No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? "
"Patrick"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present."
"Patrick"," A present? What is it?"
"SpongeBob","  It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to."
"Patrick"," Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted."
"Patrick"," Um, I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened."
"Patrick"," Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out."
"Patrick"," I've said too much already."
"Patrick"," Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we need to talk."
"Patrick"," Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?"
"Patrick"," I'm in here. Be out in a second. "
"SpongeBob"," Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha."
"Patrick","  Hello."
"SpongeBob"," What's in your hand, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Nothing."
"SpongeBob"," What's in your other hand?"
"Patrick","  Nothing in my other hand."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I gotta go."
"Patrick"," Ok, bye."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? "
"Patrick"," I would kill for a net like that! "
"SpongeBob","  Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.  Good morning, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Good morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What are you going to do today, buddy?"
"Patrick"," Eh, nothing."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Bye. "
"SpongeBob"," Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?"
"Patrick"," Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't have any binoculars, see?"
"Patrick"," You're acting weird."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not acting weird!  You're acting weird! You're... acting... weird!"
"Patrick"," OK, bye!  Hello! Who are you?"
"SpongeBob","  Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean."
"Patrick"," Oh. No."
"SpongeBob"," Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies."
"Patrick"," What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. I will pay one billion dollars for that net. "
"Patrick"," I don't know who you are, but I'm not giving you this jellyfishing net.  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar."
"SpongeBob"," Oh really?"
"Patrick"," You can't have it for any price."
"SpongeBob"," And why not?"
"Patrick"," This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's."
"SpongeBob","  A-ha!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm the scary mustache guy!"
"Patrick","  Why, SpongeBob, why? Why would you wear such a scary mustache?"
"SpongeBob"," Why would you steal my jellyfishing net?"
"Patrick"," What?! I'm your best friend!"
"SpongeBob"," You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!"
"Patrick"," How could you think that?"
"SpongeBob"," Because you said it. You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!"
"Patrick"," Gift."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net."
"SpongeBob","  For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you. Patrick? "
"SpongeBob"," What'cha doing, best friend?"
"Patrick"," I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!"
"SpongeBob"," Where are you going?"
"Patrick"," I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no!  So, this is it?"
"Patrick"," Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, don't go. I'm sorry I accused you. It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me."
"SpongeBob"," Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by."
"Patrick"," You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come here, you big lug! "
"Patrick"," I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!"
"Patrick"," You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. "
"SpongeBob"," So did I.  My best friend made it for me."
"Squidward","  I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock. "
"SpongeBob"," Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?"
"Squidward"," No, and leave me alone! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward, see ya later. "
"Squidward"," Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later. "
"Squidward","  Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?"
"Squidward"," Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first.  Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins.  Defeat has never tasted so sweet.  Yello? "
"SpongeBob"," How 'bout a game of hangman?"
"Squidward"," How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. "
"SpongeBob"," How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?"
"Squidward"," It's called, ""I will never play with you...  ever!"" "
"SpongeBob"," Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own! "
"Squidward"," I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the...  SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this... "
"Squidward"," What are you doing, SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," What manner of annoying scheme is this?"
"SpongeBob"," Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is."
"Squidward"," Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name."
"Squidward","  Hello, Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?"
"Squidward"," So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?"
"Squidward"," Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Woo-hoo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob"," How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you."
"Patrick","  Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, Patrick, this is..."
"Patrick"," D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard. "
"Squidward"," Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty?  See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. "
"SpongeBob"," Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?"
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?"
"Squidward"," Fine then. Do my work for me. "
"Squidward"," I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this."
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Mini Squid!"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, pal!  Go get em', tiger! "
"Squidward"," What the...? That's my joke!"
"Squidward"," What? All right, all right! That's enough! My break is finished. "
"Squidward"," Oh boy! Back to work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on a second, there."
"Squidward"," Oh, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this -- well not that sorry -- the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks. So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately.  Now pipe down and watch how it's done."
"Squidward"," What's the big deal? Those are all my moves! "
"Squidward"," That Mini Squid... "
"Squidward"," That was awful! "
"Squidward"," He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend, STOP STEALING MY LIFE!!!! "
"Squidward"," Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player."
"Squidward"," You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?"
"Squidward","  A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original. "
"Squidward"," Now, where do I sign? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?"
"SpongeBob"," But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere."
"SpongeBob","  Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?"
"Squidward"," My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, ""It's gonna be a good one just wait and see."" Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Why is this the best day ever you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital. I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode!  ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out of the way, boy!  Me building's been condemned, boy. We got ourselves a nematode infestation. "
"SpongeBob"," But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab. Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave  Ow! Guys, you're ruining the  best day...  Wait, no.  Best day...  Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Keep playing, lad! Take them devil sons of the sea away from me restaurant! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's!  Wait till Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah!  Hyah! "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, what on earth are you doing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, just a little something I like to call karate."
"Sandy"," I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!"
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm. I see. Ok, then I'll come back later. "
"Sandy"," Knock... it... off.  It stopped? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Sandy"," Hang on. I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh.  Oh. No Krabby Patties, no karate. At least I have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now!  Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new...  What's wrong, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I broke my net! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net. "
"Patrick"," For me? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, I broke... could I use this one? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net."
"Patrick"," Yeah? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now.  Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now.  I guess I'll see you at the concert.  It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good.  No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers.  Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?"
"Squidward"," The concert is ruined. My reed is shot.  See? I'm finished."
"SpongeBob","  Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!"
"Squidward","  But my reed! "
"SpongeBob"," Now play!"
"Squidward"," But... "
"SpongeBob"," I said play! "
"Squidward"," Not bad. "
"SpongeBob"," Now get in there and give me a concert to remember. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever."
"SpongeBob"," One ticket, coming right up, Captain!  Must be here somewhere.  I don't have a ticket."
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob, you are so... "
"SpongeBob","  A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down...  NO!  No! It is not over!"
"SpongeBob"," This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything...  SIT DOWN!  Then everything turned to doo-doo. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's okay, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not okay!  This was going to be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world working at the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy."
"Sandy"," I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick."
"Patrick"," But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?"
"Squidward"," And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust."
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things."
"SpongeBob","  It's not?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No.  It's about us!"
"SpongeBob"," It is?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you."
"SpongeBob"," You do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours.  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... ""The Best Day Ever."" And it better be good for all it's costing me."
"SpongeBob"," ♪My perfect job starts my perfect day.♪  ♪Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.♪ "
"Mr. Krabs"," That wasn't in the budget!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Sing along. Hear that happy sound♪"
"Patrick"," ♪Don't let those sour notes bring you down.♪"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪That's where it's at!♪ "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not paying for that!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"Squidward"," How long do we have to keep this up?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just till his little heart gives out."
"Patrick"," Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Happy Best Friend...whoa."
"Patrick"," This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I am truly honored and... "
"Patrick"," What's wrong, buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that. "
"Patrick"," Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift."
"SpongeBob"," Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum."
"Patrick"," Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo."
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say good-bye to Gummy, do you?"
"SpongeBob"," No, not at all."
"Patrick"," Thanks. Good-bye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear?  I love you, too, Gummy.  Well, he's all yours."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you.  Oh, you sure a re a big boy, aren't you. Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this. With a little karate. Hyah!  Ooh. Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza.  Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go.  Good-bye, stink ball. See ya never. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing? "
"Patrick"," What? Is that true?"
"SpongeBob"," No way, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Well, how do you explain this? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up.  Isn't this a cute look?"
"Patrick"," Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob. Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast.  Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are you doing? I'm waiting."
"SpongeBob"," Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy because he is so attractive and... Allow me to demonstrate.  See, Patrick, the view is beautiful down here."
"Patrick"," Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?"
"Patrick"," By the way, your house looks a million times better. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks.  Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous."
"Sandy","  What in tarnation?  Oh my gosh. SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob, open up."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy. Looks like I got myself into a sticky situation. "
"Sandy"," Oh my gosh. How long you've been stuck there, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," All day."
"Sandy"," Well, your old pal, Sandy knows how to cut you down."
"SpongeBob"," No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets."
"Sandy"," Oh, that's just crazy talk. Hyah! "
"SpongeBob"," Told ya. Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like me!"
"Sandy"," Oh, come on now, there's got to be a way.  I've got an idea.  Hang on tight, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, all righty."
"Squidward"," What the...? Just let it go, Squidward. Let it go. Don't get involved, Squidward.  Of course."
"Sandy"," I'm okay. "
"Patrick"," What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?"
"SpongeBob"," Now, Patrick, I can explain."
"Patrick"," It's-it's...it's amazing. It's like a gummy wonderland. Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I have something to tell you."
"Patrick"," Enough already. Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, well, how can I put this?"
"Patrick"," Aw, just come right out and...  Will you stop? Just stop. "
"Squidward"," Get on with it, SpongeBob."
"Sandy"," Wrap it up."
"Patrick"," Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me. I-I-I mean, your Gummy."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?"
"Patrick"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?"
"Patrick"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," It's yours, buddy. But first, you got to get us out of this."
"Patrick"," Oh, that's easy.  I told you it was easy.  Wow! This is the best Best Friends Day ever!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm, something ain't right.  For me?"
"Squidward"," Don't you find this a tad suspicious?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. "
"Plankton"," Surprise! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me secret formula!"
"Plankton"," Happy Birthday Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Attaboy, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Safe."
"Plankton"," You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles. "
"SpongeBob"," Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends. "
"SpongeBob"," Best friends?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones. "
"Plankton"," Goo! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Things were all peaches and creams.  Until we hit grade school."
"Mr. Krabs","  Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology."
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ....fashion me clothes from rags."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life."
"Mr. Krabs"," Moneyyyyyyyyyy?"
"Plankton"," Yeah. You can buy things with it."
"Mr. Krabs","  So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. "
"SpongeBob"," Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here."
"Mr. Krabs"," I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?"
"Squidward"," Yeah. I really wanna know."
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called ""Stinky Burgers"". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's.  run up clamoring] And Stinky loved the kids."
"Mr. Krabs"," Excuse us!"
"Plankton"," Valuable customers coming through."
"Mr. Krabs"," Two Stinky Burgers, please."
"Plankton"," Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?"
"Plankton"," Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. "
"Plankton"," Gently. Gently. "
"Mr. Krabs"," We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. "
"Plankton"," There you are, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money."
"Plankton"," Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe."
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought it was our recipe."
"Plankton"," I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But what about satisfying the customer?"
"Plankton"," Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Give me that!"
"Plankton"," Stop! You're gonna bust it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!"
"Plankton"," I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Which one? The one that says ""Eject"" or the one that says ""Trap Door""?"
"Plankton"," Oh, either one will do."
"Mr. Krabs"," What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did."
"Plankton","  Lies! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again."
"Plankton"," Very touching, but completely false."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't know what you mean."
"Plankton"," Why don't you tell them the truth?"
"SpongeBob"," It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton"," Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. "
"Mr. Krabs"," First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money! "
"Plankton"," But what about satisfying the customers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!"
"Plankton"," Gimme that! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop, you're gonna bust it. "
"Plankton"," This isn't about money, Eugene."
"Mr. Krabs"," Malarkey. "
"Plankton"," You'll regret this one day!  Ouch.  Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe."
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all."
"Plankton"," It was only our third date."
"Plankton"," Now that's a handsome looking burger."
"Mr. Krabs"," You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? "
"Plankton"," What's that music?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers."
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Plab Patties KO's Old Man J"". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy."
"Plankton"," Well, he is old."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey. that guy is like family to me."
"Plankton"," Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger."
"Plankton"," You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it."
"Mr. Krabs"," No way, that recipe's mine! "
"Plankton"," Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no you don't! This is my turf."
"Plankton"," I think not, Rag Boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little..."
"Plankton"," Get out of my face! "
"Plankton"," Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here."
"Plankton"," Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. "
"Plankton"," Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. "
"Plankton"," I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best."
"Plankton"," You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me."
"Mr. Krabs"," You callin' me a liar?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back."
"Plankton"," My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?"
"Plankton"," It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'd like that, Planky, old chum. "
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?"
"Plankton"," I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Me, too. Me, too. "
"Plankton"," Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy. "
"SpongeBob","  Sabotage!"
"Plankton"," Go, Karen! "
"Squidward"," You already ordered."
"Squidward"," Hurry up, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," What is taking you so long?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm adding the love!"
"Squidward"," You're not being paid to love."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not here for the money.  I'll always treasure these moments we had together."
"Squidward"," Look!"
"SpongeBob"," Awww..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!"
"SpongeBob"," The Jim? He who flipped patties in the before times?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?"
"Squidward"," Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," That's me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath."
"Mr. Krabs"," Your ""Best Employee Ever"" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Would you sign my Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. Not unless you look RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Now I feel complete!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now how about that patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's a thing of beauty!"
"SpongeBob"," What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm the new fry cook, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?"
"SpongeBob"," Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!"
"SpongeBob"," Am I a fraud?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?"
"SpongeBob"," Crying my eyes out."
"Squidward"," Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too."
"SpongeBob"," Why, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!"
"Squidward"," Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!"
"SpongeBob"," The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign.  ""Dear Mr. Krabs,..."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come here. Help us cheer for Jim."
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain.  Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2."
"SpongeBob","  Goodbye, freezer."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!"
"SpongeBob"," Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook."
"SpongeBob"," But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me."
"Squidward"," No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off."
"Squidward"," Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet."
"Mr. Krabs"," Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim."
"Mr. Krabs"," What now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Scuse me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A raise? That's not in my ""Hiptionary"". Help me get with it, Jack."
"Mr. Krabs"," These sideburns aren't real."
"Squidward"," My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have you're cheap!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I never thought about it that way!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, you'll stay?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  ""And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!""  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Whoa! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy? "
"SpongeBob","  The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Get a hold of yourself, boy. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it now, boy?"
"SpongeBob","   Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then don't blink."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Mr. Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, it's working... "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got 15 orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties."
"SpongeBob"," You want me to go in there? "
"SpongeBob"," Save me, the darkness!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?"
"SpongeBob"," Night light?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!"
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Night light, night light... Oh!  Oh, it's beautiful!  Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that I can see...  Woo-hoo! I can sleep!  I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom!  Night light! Night light!  Oh, thank you, thank you!  There, there, there, and there.  I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary.  Now there's not one square inch of dark!"
"SpongeBob"," What was that, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob's having a party without me?  Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that. "
"SpongeBob"," That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!"
"Patrick"," Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Patrick!  What is that, Gary?  Patrick, what are you doing!?"
"Patrick"," Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light."
"SpongeBob"," You know what that means?  Sleepover!  Your sleeping bag, sir."
"Patrick"," Thank you, my good man. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t..."
"Squidward","  Burning! "
"SpongeBob"," The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... "
"Squidward"," What are you two whimpering about? "
"Squidward"," It's me, Squidward, you idiots! "
"Patrick"," Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?"
"SpongeBob"," But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-"
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination. "
"Patrick"," No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark!  Oh, why won't he listen? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?"
"Patrick"," Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!"
"SpongeBob"," You said it, Pat! "
"Patrick"," Quick! Turn it on, SpongeBob!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights! "
"Patrick"," More lights, SpongeBob! More lights! "
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man!?"
"Patrick"," Barnacle Boy!?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the creepy creatures of the dark! We weren't trying to summon you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here! "
"SpongeBob"," Say, let me help you!  Is that enough light for you?  Well, he's all taken care of."
"SpongeBob"," The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon! "
"SpongeBob"," We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter."
"Patrick"," Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Pat! Come Ba... "
"Patrick","  Too much light! Too much light! "
"SpongeBob"," Good...morning, Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like?"
"Patrick","  Huh? What? Huh? No!  What's making that noise? Hu-huh?  Oh.  It's you again.  Okay, joke's over.  Alright, you got me. Now cut it out.  That's it!  Stop your ringing, mister! I'm warning you. Stop it! I said quit it!  Where's it coming from? Make it stop.  You've got to help me find out where that ringing is coming from.  Hey, come back! Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who cares.  SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from?  Breakfast!  Come to Patrick!  Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures!  Oh. The food is in the can. Okay, come on out. Come on. Oh, yeah.  Okay, breakfast, get on the plate. Come on. Nice, comfy plate just for you. Come on, get on there. Hello? Anybody in there?  No answer. I'm coming to rescue you.  Having a little trouble reaching you.  You stupid cans.  Oh. Food. Ah, my favorite time of the day. Breakfast and a little morning television. "
"Patrick"," Oh my gosh.  I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!  I gotta put on my teeth and brush my pants!  Gary?   A clean mouth is a happy mouth.  Done. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, how was your morning?"
"Patrick"," Oh, you know, usual."
"SpongeBob"," What's this?  It says a free prize!  Huh? Where's my prize?  ""Free Prize.""  ""Offer inside""! Just send in 99 box tops!  How you doing over there, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Send in the box tops...  ...before eating all the cereal?!?  Gary, you are a genius! "
"SpongeBob","  I'm waiting. I'm waiting."
"Patrick"," I'm waiting."
"SpongeBob"," We're waiting."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?"
"SpongeBob"," We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy."
"Patrick","  I love toys! Can I wait for your toy with you?"
"SpongeBob"," Why, sure."
"Patrick"," There's the mailman!"
"SpongeBob"," Yup.  Isn't there anything else?"
"SpongeBob"," Guess we'll have to keep waiting. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, I'm hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Me, too."
"Patrick"," Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone? "
"Patrick"," What's wrong SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him."
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm gonna take off then. I don't think my arm can stand much more of this. "
"SpongeBob","  Got to stay focused. "
"Sandy"," Hiya! Hey, SpongeBob, want to do some karaaaaaa...! "
"SpongeBob"," Not now, I'm busy.  Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!?  So tired.  So hungry.  But... must wait... for toy."
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy."
"SpongeBob","  What?! What do you want?! Can't you see I'm doing something here?!  This better be good."
"Patrick"," You missed your surprise birthday party, so I just wanted to bring you a present and some cake because you missed it."
"SpongeBob","  My birthday party?  I missed... my... birthday party?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, see?  Here's a present and your cake."
"SpongeBob"," My birthday cake."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Let me just get you a fork so you can eat it.  Uh, let me just hold the cake like this,  so I can get you a fork.  Huh, I wonder where I put that fork.  Oops."
"SpongeBob","  That was my cake.  What is the present?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah.  The fork!"
"SpongeBob","  That stupid toy! I wasted my whole life waiting for it!"
"Patrick"," Actually, you've only been here 20 minutes."
"SpongeBob"," I've been mean to Gary and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me cause... I'm a big jerk! "
"Patrick"," No, I don't."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, you do."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Could you come back later? He's having a moment."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick","  I said he's having a moment! Now leave him alone!"
"SpongeBob","  No, Patrick, people like me don't deserve moments.  I get so caught up in..."
"SpongeBob","  ...in waiting for... my toy!  Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Patrick"," Yup."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I waited so long..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  And you broke it..."
"Patrick"," You okay, buddy?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, yes I'm okay."
"Patrick","  For a sec, I..."
"SpongeBob","  You! You ruined my free toy!"
"Patrick"," I'm sorry. Oh, maybe if you just... "
"Squidward","  Just keep walking, Squiddy, don't make eye contact.  Ah, now to soothe my frayed nerves.  Alright, what's going on? Why are you two crying?"
"SpongeBob","  I-I ate... bo-bo-box tops. And then... I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And then he came and we're waiting. We're waiting. And then my toy and then you and then snap and then this. "
"Squidward"," There. Now see?  It's supposed to do that."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, my toy's okay!"
"Squidward"," Good. Now will you two be quiet?"
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick, Squidward fixed it.  How can we ever thank you?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, how can we thank you? "
"Squidward"," Move to another neighborhood."
"SpongeBob"," Gary! What are you doing!?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!"
"SpongeBob"," There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!"
"SpongeBob"," What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company! "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob! Eww! "
"SpongeBob"," Is something wrong, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! What is that?"
"SpongeBob"," What's what?"
"Patrick"," This! "
"SpongeBob"," Ow! P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?"
"Patrick"," Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!"
"SpongeBob"," Good idea! "
"Patrick"," Uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Patrick"," I don't know about this!"
"SpongeBob"," What makes you say that?"
"Patrick"," This."
"SpongeBob","  Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Sure do! Well, I gotta go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  Itch!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind! Huh?  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?"
"SpongeBob"," All what-y?"
"Squidward"," Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all! "
"Squidward"," That's no blemish!"
"SpongeBob"," Help… Me!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'll help you, alright! "
"SpongeBob"," What's going on, Squidward? Help! "
"Squidward","  Here's your change, sir. "
"Squidward"," What was that? No, no Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick. "
"SpongeBob"," Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home! "
"SpongeBob"," Where's my snail, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Whoa! "
"Patrick"," Wow!  Huh? What is this? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!"
"Patrick"," Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!"
"Patrick"," Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I win! I win! I win!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," I've got an idea! "
"SpongeBob"," There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands!  Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!"
"Squidward","  No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…"
"Squidward"," If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in the Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids. "
"Squidward","  Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's all the commotion about?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!"
"Squidward"," No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab! "
"SpongeBob","  Ohhhh, noo!  Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!  Nooooo! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," It's not me, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission? "
"Mr. Krabs"," He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid! "
"Patrick"," I believe the expression is starfish first."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now can I get you a Krabby Patty? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright! "
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Another 5 dollars for another de-Icking. "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work! "
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe.  Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big."
"Squidward","  Hello."
"Mr. Krabs"," One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work."
"Squidward","  Goodbye."
"Mr. Krabs"," I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton."
"SpongeBob"," Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm going to be a spy."
"Patrick"," You're a spy?!  I wanna be a spy, too!!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet."
"Mr. Krabs"," Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," In my hands.  Ooh!"
"Patrick","  Ooh. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds. "
"SpongeBob"," Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," That's going to leave a mark. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets like jet-packs and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies."
"Sandy"," Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses, and my favorite, the knockout ray. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies."
"Sandy","  I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff."
"SpongeBob"," What do we do now, Patrick? "
"Patrick"," What's he doing now?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing yet. Wait! Wait! He's...  ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer."
"Plankton"," Excuse me?  Do you have anything in a size negative five?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes? "
"Patrick"," How embarrassing. "
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabs here. Go ahead."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton just bought some baby clothes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Baby clothes? Hmm...  What's he doing now?"
"SpongeBob"," Hold on.  He's buying..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah? Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," A... stamp."
"Mr. Krabs"," A stamp.  This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," We're right behind him, and he has no idea! "
"Plankton"," Would you stop making all that racket? "
"Patrick"," What's he doing now?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't tell. "
"Plankton"," Whew! Gosh, it's hot.  Ahhhh!"
"SpongeBob"," He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-packs!"
"Patrick"," Can do! "
"Plankton"," Whew. Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!"
"Patrick"," To the spy mobile! "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield..."
"Patrick"," Self destruct!!  There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone."
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," It's for you."
"SpongeBob"," Agent SpongeBob here."
"Mr. Krabs"," You found out what Plankton's up to?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Exactly. So get to work. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?"
"Patrick"," I think the front door's open."
"SpongeBob"," Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside."
"Patrick"," This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants! "
"SpongeBob"," Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn.  I thought you were holding the rope -- "
"Patrick"," I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission."
"Plankton","  Secret mission, eh?  Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer!  I'll let you two look over the menu. "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, I have to go."
"SpongeBob"," Can't you go later?"
"Patrick","  My laser pants aren't working right. "
"Plankton"," Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?"
"Patrick"," No, thank you."
"Plankton"," Or perhaps a bran muffin?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I have to go now!"
"Plankton"," Prune Danish?  What the...?  Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why's it dark? I think I put off my cataract surgery too long."
"Squidward"," No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month."
"Mr. Krabs","  Merciful Neptune!  Man your battle stations!"
"Squidward"," I'm on it! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Bring it on, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Oh, I will. We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume. "
"Mr. Krabs"," He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly?  You can have 'em! "
"Plankton","  Do your worst, Krabs!"
"Squidward","  I hate my job. "
"SpongeBob","  It's up to you and me, buddy!"
"Patrick"," Abandon ship! "
"Plankton"," Pointy-headed projectile on the port side! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha ha ha! Huh?  No! "
"Plankton","  I win! I always win! "
"SpongeBob"," Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose."
"Plankton"," No, SpongeBob, I always... "
"Mr. Krabs"," ...win!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  That's right!  I stole me own formula!"
"SpongeBob"," But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's...  Mr. Krabs is a robot! "
"Plankton"," No, you idiot."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for 20 years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!"
"Plankton"," I almost had it 37 times, and you know it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet.  You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!"
"Plankton","  You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try."
"Plankton"," Ha! The usual wager?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're on.  So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game.  And destroyed his place of business!  Now pay up."
"Plankton"," Here you go, Eugene.  One a-dollar."
"Patrick"," Not so fast! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Then who are you?"
"Squidward"," I'm not...  ...wearing a disguise. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be...  ...Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Whoops, wrong outfit. "
"SpongeBob","  You're me! Then I must be... "
"Patrick"," Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Nah, I'm just kidding. "
"Patrick"," I really am Patrick. "
"SpongeBob"," Good one, Patrick!  There's just one thing I don't understand."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that, laddie?"
"SpongeBob"," That. "
"Squidward"," Ripping good day for a spot of driving."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, perfect. "
"Squidward"," Hey, use your mirrors, fool!"
"SpongeBob"," Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. "
"Squidward"," Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Hi there!"
"SpongeBob"," How's it going? "
"SpongeBob"," Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. "
"SpongeBob"," Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! "
"SpongeBob"," Exciting reading, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. You bet you, SpongeBob. Listen to this. Individual waste of the enus will substantially broaden the probability of multiple substantial visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters and one half of one percent meaning if you call the customers by their names, they keep coming to spend more of their green back! So I want you two to learn the names of every customer."
"Squidward"," I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies."
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest. The employee who learns more names wins this. "
"Squidward"," A tropical getaway? On the triple decker Conhugo cruise liner? Sunbathing—Parcheesi—ballroom dancing! This is going to be so easy. SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of The Krusty Krab. While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, Ill be out here, building a rapport with the customers.  Hello. May I get you anything else, Miss--"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sally! Hi, Sadie! Hi, Shubie!"
"Squidward"," How does SpongeBob know all these names?"
"SpongeBob"," Right back at you, Lenny!"
"Squidward"," Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register? I think it's broken."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure, Squidward."
"Squidward"," I think you might need a closer look. Let me give you a hand. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't see anything in here, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Keep looking, SpongeBob. keep on looking.  So, what's your name? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Thaddeus!"
"Squidward"," Good-bye, SpongeBob.  That should buy me enough time to win that cruise. "
"SpongeBob"," Gus!"
"Squidward","  How in Neptune's creation do you know all these names, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book. "
"Squidward","  Thanks, SpongeBob!  Let's see. Halbert, Norma, Isabelle, Gus, Chas, Pelar, Jess, Cara, Ivy, Harv, Mable, Mavis--  And your name is—Suzie Fish, correct?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs! That's the last customer. Do I win?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score. But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck. That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker. "
"Squidward"," Uh, that's, that's--"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him. It's-- something."
"Mr. Krabs"," He's the ticket to your prize."
"Squidward","  Out of the way, loser.  Um, hello. My name is Squidward.  Uh, so, what's your name?"
"Squidward"," Uh, it's just that I was going to—enter your name in our sweepstakes!  So, what should I put down?"
"Squidward"," Sure."
"Squidward","  I see he wants to play hard to get. So be it! I have ways of making the likes of him talk.  Uh, sir, you forgot your soda."
"Squidward"," It's on the house. "
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped. Here, let me get that off of you.  Okay, there must be a name tag or some form of I.D. in here."
"Squidward"," Hey, look up in the sky! A giant meteor is hurtling towards Earth."
"Squidward"," Oh, you'll see it, Just keep looking."
"Squidward"," Well, that's too bad, because I found what I was looking for. "
"Squidward","  Finally, the moment of truth! Say good-bye to anonymity, Mr.--"
"Squidward"," No, you don't understand. I only want the wallet for--"
"Squidward","  This isn't as it seems!"
"Squidward","  His driver's license!  At last! At last! And your name is--  Mr. What Zit Tooya? What kind of ridiculous name is that?"
"Squidward"," But-but-but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong."
"Squidward","  Only 364 more days and 9 years left until I exchange this concrete tomb for a multi-story ocean liner cruise. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict."
"Squidward"," Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win.  I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Enjoy your prize."
"Squidward"," Whoo-hoo-hoo! Tropical vacation, here I come! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Vacation? Who said anything about a vacation?"
"Squidward","  What? In the brochure, it specifically gives away an ocean liner vacation."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize."
"Squidward"," You mean, no vacation?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, just the brochure. Well, got to get back to counting me loot. Enjoy your new prize, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," See you on the outside in ten years, buddy. "
"Squidward","  Oh, well. At least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years."
"Patrick","  Hey, Squidward. Parcheesi? "
"SpongeBob"," Got to hurry, Gary.   The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," I'm just going to turn out the lights. Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?  TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job."
"Squidward"," One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four."
"SpongeBob"," Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat."
"Squidward"," Spill at table..."
"SpongeBob","  I'm on it!  Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle.  Kiddies get a free touch-up.  All done!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did."
"Mr. Krabs"," What'd you do?"
"SpongeBob"," I was a minute late for work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A minute late?"
"SpongeBob"," A whole 60 seconds."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, uh, don't do it again."
"SpongeBob"," No! No! You have to punish me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you can clean the salad bar."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Be sure to close up when you're done."
"SpongeBob"," I will."
"Mr. Krabs"," And good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I love it here, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh."
"Squidward"," If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? "
"SpongeBob"," Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock?  Maybe it's my old bed.  Oh, that's it.  I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary? "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," How long you been here?"
"SpongeBob"," All night, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," All night?"
"SpongeBob"," That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son."
"SpongeBob","  Here's my first month's rent."
"Mr. Krabs"," Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill..."
"SpongeBob"," Already done, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties..."
"SpongeBob"," Done.  All that, before we even open up our doors, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess."
"SpongeBob"," Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up. "
"Squidward"," Jammed again. "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? What are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I live here now."
"Squidward"," In the dishwasher?"
"SpongeBob"," No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. Oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Must be a full moon.  Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!."
"SpongeBob"," Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?"
"Squidward","  No. Coming Eugene.  Good night's sleep, here I come.  And when I went home at night, guess what?"
"Squidward"," Right! And when I woke up in the morning..."
"Squidward","  He still wasn't there."
"Squidward","  Here you go."
"Squidward"," Socks and--  What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection.  So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery."
"SpongeBob"," Do you want to know where the mustard is? "
"Squidward"," Ah! Eww.  Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor."
"SpongeBob","  Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, they don't see to mind. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely."
"SpongeBob","  Aye aye, captain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—meaning yours—to interfere with said money spending.  What the barnacles?  SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?"
"SpongeBob"," It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen.  So I moved in here."
"Mr. Krabs"," You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day."
"SpongeBob"," But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, Mr...  My parents!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Your parents?"
"SpongeBob","  Mom! Dad! Come on in.  And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'll let you two get settled."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! Bad boy! No!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward, who put these fancy smelling soaps in the restroom?"
"Squidward"," The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Argh.  That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, I...  What the...?"
"Patrick","  Thanks, SpongeBob.  If I could reach it, I'd do it myself. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me customers!  Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money!  SPONGEBOB! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out. "
"Squidward"," What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums!  "
"Squidward"," NOOOOOOOOOO!!! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Oh, it's freezing in here."
"SpongeBob"," Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty. "
"Squidward"," I'm so glad I don't eat ""here""  Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway?  62°? Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to start it to a toasty 63.  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs","  WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT?!?!?! "
"Squidward","  Oh, thanks a-- "
"SpongeBob"," You're welcome, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this."
"Squidward","  ""Do not touch thermostat ever."" "
"Mr. Krabs"," Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!"
"Squidward"," That's totally selfish!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?!  Hey, you kids get off of my lawn! "
"Plankton"," That's right. Run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it using your thermostat!  What the--? Oh, no. Code red! Abandon ship!  No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge. "
"Squidward"," I'm going to go recover from hypothermia."
"SpongeBob"," Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It means that he's a big fat cry baby."
"Plankton"," That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place.  Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs. its just business.  Well, maybe it is personal.  I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Someone—touching—thermostat. "
"Squidward"," I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday."
"SpongeBob"," That's why I wore mittens.  Mm. Toasty!"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Morning, boys.  Lock's a bit sticky this morning.  Is it cold in here or is it just me? Well, get to work. "
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.  Pardon me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, quit clowning around and get to work."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir."
"Squidward"," As long as you turn the heat up."
"Mr. Krabs","  The temperature stays at 62 degrees."
"Squidward"," There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones. Don't... touch... the thermostat! "
"Plankton","  I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit your lollygagging and get a move on. "
"Squidward"," Order up."
"Plankton"," Yes, flee that frozen wasteland. Warmth and joy have left your lives.  Hey, buddy. you want to eat The Chum Bucket?  Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back.  I don't understand. What's bringing them back?  What the--?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just put those patties back when you're done."
"SpongeBob"," Can do, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," I'm really glad I don't eat here."
"SpongeBob"," Order up!"
"SpongeBob"," Coming right up, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook them. This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life. "
"Plankton"," No! How is this possible? I freeze this place solid and he turns it into an ice rink. He's making more money than ever."
"Plankton"," Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings."
"Plankton"," I'll be right back. "
"Mr. Krabs"," This is fantastic. The local hockey team is paying me to practice here."
"SpongeBob"," Coming through!  Hi, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Holy shrimp! Plankton! "
"Plankton"," I did it. I finally got a Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me, first."
"SpongeBob"," You're mine now, Plankton!  You won't get away with this, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my weekend was fabulous. Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug.  Swallowed a bug."
"Plankton"," Fascinating. Well, got to go. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Plankton"," Better luck next time, SpongeBob."
"Plankton"," Uh-oh.  Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Hold it right there, Mr. "
"Plankton"," Yes, I'm going to make it. "
"SpongeBob"," Got you, Plankton."
"Plankton"," On the contrary, It is I who has you. "
"SpongeBob","  The clamboni! "
"Plankton","  Run, you fools. Run!  It's working. I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty.  Come on, get out of the way! You're blocking the exit.  No! No! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll take that.  Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  You lose again, Plankton."
"Plankton"," I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon.  The thermostat! "
"Mr. Krabs","  The thermostat."
"Plankton"," That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab.  See?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You've gone too far this time, Plankton. You can pound me employees,  try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat. "
"Plankton"," See, Krabs, you can't defeat me. "
"SpongeBob"," Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Thank you, lad.  Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab. Hey, you got any more good ideas? "
"Plankton"," "
"SpongeBob","  And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you gotta see this. It's an emergency broadcast on my TV."
"Patrick"," Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line! "
"SpongeBob"," Glove World!. Roller coaster. First in line. "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? "
"SpongeBob"," In the name of amusement, no...! "
"SpongeBob","  I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! "
"Patrick"," You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?"
"SpongeBob"," No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night."
"Patrick"," Really? Me too!"
"SpongeBob"," What was your dream about, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh, look, the bus is here! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds..."
"Patrick"," Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, really fun. "
"SpongeBob"," That sure looks like fun."
"Patrick"," Yeah, I can't wait to ride it. "
"SpongeBob"," No tickets. I must have left it at home."
"Patrick"," I swallowed my tickets."
"SpongeBob"," I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, barnacles!.  It sure was lucky we found our tickets."
"Patrick"," Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck."
"SpongeBob"," There it is. The line looks awfully long."
"Patrick"," Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. "
"Patrick"," Phew."
"SpongeBob"," Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. "
"Patrick"," How do I look?  Wow, I look great. "
"SpongeBob","  I mean, The Mitten."
"Patrick"," That ride's for babies."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. "
"Patrick"," I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? "
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. "
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob","  We've gone eight times."
"Patrick"," And I went three times all by myself."
"SpongeBob"," Bye."
"Patrick"," Have fun! "
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Larry."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry."
"SpongeBob"," Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! "
"Patrick"," I'm hungry, too. "
"Patrick"," Want some?"
"SpongeBob"," No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows."
"Patrick"," Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back. "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry back so we can go on the ride. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do."
"SpongeBob"," I know, but the ride is really scary."
"SpongeBob"," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"Patrick"," It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah?  I thought we'd settled this the last time! "
"SpongeBob"," Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, I have to tell you something."
"SpongeBob"," I have to tell you something too, Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  Warning! This ride may cause Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas..."
"SpongeBob"," Is that all?"
"Patrick"," Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning."
"SpongeBob"," Well, this is it, Pat."
"Patrick"," Yep."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," On the Fiery Fist O' Pain."
"Patrick"," After you. "
"SpongeBob"," We made it."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," We made it!"
"Patrick"," We're not scaredy cats."
"SpongeBob"," We're not crybabies."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride."
"Patrick"," Me too."
"SpongeBob"," I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you."
"Patrick"," I didn't want you to be disappointed in me."
"SpongeBob"," But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken."
"Patrick"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Good-bye, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Good-bye, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," We conquered our fears!"
"Patrick"," We stopped crying!"
"SpongeBob"," We survived the Fist o' Pain!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's go again!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"Plankton"," Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. at least it's structurally sound.  Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business."
"Plankton"," Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul.  Whoa! Whoa!  I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor.  Ah! This is a job for an imbecile!  Or two imbeciles.  Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble."
"SpongeBob"," Aw. well, we can help you. right, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Uh-huh. I came prepared too.  Alright, lets do it. "
"Plankton"," Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz."
"Plankton"," Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?"
"Plankton"," Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen, now would you?"
"Plankton"," Well, hop to it, lads."
"Squidward","  Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe."
"Squidward"," What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz. "
"Squidward"," Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?"
"Patrick"," Plankton says he needs our artistic vision."
"SpongeBob"," Let's show him "
"Squidward"," You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes. "
"Squidward"," Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons."
"Plankton"," Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?"
"Plankton"," Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut. "
"SpongeBob"," I see what you mean."
"Plankton"," Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?"
"SpongeBob","  La-la-la-la-la-la-la. "
"Plankton","  Secret formula, here I come. "
"SpongeBob"," La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."
"Plankton"," Perfect. Huh?  No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes. Voila! "
"Squidward"," A log cabin?"
"Plankton"," Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art. "
"Squidward"," Everyone's a critic."
"Plankton"," I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab."
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess I hadn't thought about that."
"Patrick"," I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind."
"Plankton"," See, SpongeBob. Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window. "
"Patrick"," Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird. "
"Plankton"," Can't you two do anything right?! I give you one simple task after another and—Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing—life guarding—creative writing—all such bitter failures. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh. It's okay, little green—creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom."
"Plankton","  Really?"
"SpongeBob"," And how. Come on, fellows. let's do some interior decorating."
"Squidward"," Oh. good-bye, paintbrush. hello, antique fitting."
"Plankton","  Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while. "
"Plankton"," I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No, no tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula is—one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe . This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!  Huh? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to The Chum Bucket?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation."
"SpongeBob"," I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation. "
"Mr. Krabs","  And I bet you tried to steal this, too."
"Plankton","  Well, steal is such a strong word. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. do you?"
"Plankton"," ...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors.   "
"Plankton"," Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?"
"Squidward"," That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket."
"Mr. Krabs"," And these metal decorations?"
"Squidward"," Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls."
"Mr. Krabs"," And the computer? "
"Squidward"," Oh, that's Plankton's wife."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime."
"Mr. Krabs"," But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo!  ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done.  In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially— you.  Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I need that order of six."
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. "
"Squidward"," Uh— yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath ""That which is fried, must be eaten."""
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. "
"Squidward"," Right here, muscleboy."
"SpongeBob","  I won't let you do this to Patty."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing."
"Squidward","  What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? "
"SpongeBob"," Great idea. "
"Squidward","  I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist."
"SpongeBob","  Enjoy, sir."
"SpongeBob"," What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, how about another game of—  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah!  Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready."
"Sandy"," Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for bebopping all over Timbuktu."
"SpongeBob","  Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way."
"Patrick"," I've been replaced by a sandwich!  Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. "

"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting."
"Squidward"," How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well— actually— "
"SpongeBob"," Good day, sir."
"Squidward"," As if on cue."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date."
"Mr. Krabs"," A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady?  By the way, is she rich?"

"Squidward","  What's that putrid odor?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, it's that Krabby Patty.  What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the ""manager's treatment,"" do you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry, boy. no can do."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What was that? I couldn't hear you."
"SpongeBob","  How about now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, take a seat. "
"SpongeBob"," Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?"
"Squidward"," Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods— why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint."
"SpongeBob"," Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie."
"Squidward"," I'll show you sick. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?"
"Squidward"," Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is? "
"SpongeBob","  Stop it, Squidward. Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea."
"Squidward"," Well, I definitely see I can't the mentally atrophied. Good-bye, Creature."
"SpongeBob"," Pay you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due."
"SpongeBob"," I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty. Employee discount."
"SpongeBob","  Can I get a doggie bag with that?"
"Patrick"," Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick. We're all out."
"Patrick"," Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Squidward"," What are you two morons doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Waiting to watch the sunrise with you."
"Squidward"," At 347 in the morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Squidward"," In my bedroom?"
"SpongeBob"," We come here every morning."
"Squidward"," You sneak into my house every morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. "
"Patrick"," It's our favorite pastime."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong with Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?"
"SpongeBob"," Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave. "
"Squidward"," And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--"
"Squidward"," And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward"," --for as long as time shall stand."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What? "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Get out!  Perfect."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party."
"Squidward"," Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this is so neat."
"Patrick"," I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob? "
"Squidward"," It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in. "
"Patrick"," Let's do it again."
"SpongeBob"," Let's do it again."
"Patrick"," Can we, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Huh? What? No! Get out!"
"SpongeBob"," But--"
"Squidward"," No! You're going out this door, right now-- "
"SpongeBob"," You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us."
"Squidward"," Do they have cute sea horses there?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, they're pretty adorable."
"Squidward"," And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Squidward"," Can I come?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Uh, new glasses?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no. I mean he seems happier."
"Squidward","  Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you! "
"Patrick"," He's probably happy about his new glasses."
"Squidward"," Good morning, SpongeBob.  Hoooonk!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us. "
"Squidward"," Hello, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?"
"Squidward"," I wanted to help you work."
"SpongeBob"," What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!"
"Squidward"," How are we today? Everything a-okay here?"
"Squidward"," How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke. "
"Squidward"," Who wants a free refill?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did someone just say ""free""? In my restaurant?!  What's the problem here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," FREE?!  Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them."
"Mr. Krabs"," They look okay to me."
"SpongeBob"," But he's not a real fry cook."
"Mr. Krabs"," He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you. "
"Squidward"," Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month."
"SpongeBob"," Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the meaning of this?"
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong with it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A smiley face with dimples? "
"SpongeBob","  Dimples? It was him! No, Squidward did it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month. "
"Patrick","  Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know."
"SpongeBob"," The guy you're looking for is over there. "
"Patrick"," Oh. SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Patrick"," I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--"
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm?"
"Patrick"," Help me spell 'Squidward'. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Patrick"," Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house! "
"Squidward"," Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake. "
"Squidward"," I love being Employee of the Month."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  MAYBE YOU AN TAKE MY JOB! AND MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE MY PLACE ON THE EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH WALL OF FAME! BUNT NOBODY, AND I MEAN NOBODY, POGO DANCES WITH THAT GUY BUT ME! ""he confiscates Squidward's pogo stick]"" Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there."
"SpongeBob"," May I help you, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly."
"SpongeBob"," How will that help them chew faster?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's the problem?"
"SpongeBob"," No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table."
"Mr. Krabs"," Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else."
"SpongeBob"," Why did you give him the table?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know what they say ""Money Talks."""
"SpongeBob"," I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out?  What do you have against old people?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk."
"SpongeBob"," Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah. Wait a minute..."
"Squidward"," What's that music?"
"SpongeBob"," I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing."
"Squidward"," Oh, great."
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life would be. We'd tell each other secrets, all their friends would visit me. I'd bathe in filthy riches, which is clean enough for me. Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be. We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree. There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see. If I could talk to money, come along, sing with me.♪"
"Squidward"," Uh, no thanks, I got to go."
"SpongeBob"," I really have to pee."
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪If I could talk to money, and it could talk to me. We'd always be the best of friends, for all eternity.♪ "
"Patrick","  What did I miss?"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Oh...♪  ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life...♪  Parlez vous Francais? Hable Español? Ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? Mm-hmm. Maybe this will make you talk. Talk!

"Mr. Krabs"," You?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, is that pixie dust?  Whew, that was a strange dream."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who said that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Do you have anything to say to me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It worked! I can talk to money. Oh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends. "
"Squidward"," That'll be five dollars. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Good morning, my darlings."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're coming home with me."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money.  Go ahead, say hello."
"SpongeBob"," Hello... money."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, aren't they a riot? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs."
"Squidward"," I'm worried he just left with my paycheck. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets."
"Mr. Krabs"," You have any friends you can invite over?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guy might want some company, you know, to make you happy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, so how can I make you happy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? No way."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Unfortunately."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, lookin' good. "
"Patrick","  What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. He's acting kind of weird. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not listening..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not...  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane."
"Mr. Krabs","  Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it.  What have I done?  Give me that back. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok,glad you're not insane. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away!  I want a refund."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already."
"Mr. Krabs"," To those guys."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out."
"SpongeBob"," He was five bucks short on payday. "
"SpongeBob"," What's going on? What could it mean?"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?"
"Squidward"," A miracle, a marvel. It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace."
"Mr. Krabs"," But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?"
"Squidward"," I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face. "
"Mr. Krabs","  I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time."
"Squidward"," Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime."
"Mr. Krabs"," Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?"
"Squidward"," Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, ""Get lost."" "
"SpongeBob","  I challenge your gadget. I declare patty war!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ready, set, go...!"
"Sandy"," Wow!"
"SpongeBob"," I won't be defeated!"
"Squidward"," Not bad!"
"Squidward"," A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high. "
"Squidward"," Ha, ha."
"Sandy"," What a schnook."
"SpongeBob"," I won't lose to that thing!"
"Squidward"," I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat."
"Squidward","  Let me know if I've won!"
"SpongeBob"," Foul beast, do your worst!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo, yeah! "
"Squidward"," Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you.  All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple.  Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing.  And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...! "
"Patrick"," Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win."
"Squidward"," What? What are you two doing?"
"SpongeBob"," We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions."
"Patrick"," We're gonna win the trophy."
"Squidward"," Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going. "
"SpongeBob"," You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend."
"Squidward"," no, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye. "
"Patrick"," Ruling, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I think we better raise the bar. "
"Squidward"," Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Do I know you?"
"SpongeBob","  You kidder. Let's go, Patrick."
"Squidward"," Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You actually got in?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep."
"Squidward"," Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in."
"Squidward"," Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please. "
"Squidward"," Excuse me?"
"Squidward"," But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it..."
"Squidward"," But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Doh, help me up."
"SpongeBob"," How'd the audition go, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," The audition? My trophy?  I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition.  Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life."
"Patrick"," Whoa."
"SpongeBob"," Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?"
"Squidward"," What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes."
"Patrick"," Like polishing your empty trophy case?"
"Squidward"," Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?"
"Squidward"," Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Ok, here I go. Watch me now.  Cramp! "
"Squidward"," Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and...  Having fun?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, yes I am."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...plié.  Relevé.  And now grand jeté.  Where am I? See if I can find the lights.  Wait a minute.  This gives me an idea.  Ready, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Ready!"
"Squidward"," A one and a two, and...  Plié, jeté, relevé -  No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet."
"SpongeBob","  How'd you know? "
"Squidward"," Gimme those.  That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing?  Why are you moving your arms like that?"
"SpongeBob","  I guess they're happy."
"Squidward"," Argh, hand 'em over.  And the other one, come on.  Ah, now that's more like it."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help."
"Squidward"," Are you questioning my leadership."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I just..."
"Squidward"," Ok, hand it over. "
"SpongeBob"," You know what, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here."
"Squidward"," Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves."
"SpongeBob"," Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent."
"Squidward"," Quit groveling. Where is your dignity?  These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more."
"SpongeBob"," Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight. "
"Squidward"," Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent."
"Squidward"," Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see...  Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! "
"Squidward"," Must finish dance... on other... "
"SpongeBob"," Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?"
"Squidward","  I'm in pain! "
"Squidward","  Mine!  I won, I won!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone. "
"Squidward"," Wait, SpongeBob, no! "
"SpongeBob"," I love your new dance, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Thanks."
"Patrick"," Hey, everybody, let's all do ""the cramp""!"
"Squidward"," Okay, would you like any fries with that?"
"Squidward"," And two orders of—"
"Squidward"," But you said ""two."""
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, order up.  Welcome to The Krusty—  SpongeBob, what in Neptune's...  SpongeBob?  Well, his spatula's still warm.  Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahoy, Squidward.  Good Neptune, SpongeBob. what has gotten into to you, son?"
"Squidward"," I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, Squidward. this is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days.  What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money!  It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date.  ""Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab."""
"Squidward"," That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say.  I rest my case.  Hey, in or out, mister. You're lettering out the A.C.  Weirdo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... "
"Squidward"," Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 600. "
"Mr. Krabs"," M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely—  Complimentary.  Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all.  He's nobody.  We're doomed! "
"Squidward"," She is so tacky."
"Mr. Krabs"," Turn it up, Squidward. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, no, wait! Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, back to work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy. "
"SpongeBob"," La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes."
"SpongeBob"," Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Umm— yeah, a little bit like that. "
"SpongeBob"," Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? "
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward"," Well, Fairness is the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. see? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, what's going on over here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for $5."
"Mr. Krabs"," Look at these, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Looks like some horrific shroud."
"Mr. Krabs"," They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent."
"Squidward"," You really need to see a doctor."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. "
"Squidward"," What's in them?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Condiments. We got ""Tangy Spongy Sauce"" and ""Mild Bobby Sauce"" for the not-so-daring."
"Squidward"," Oh, clever. "
"SpongeBob"," Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward.  You're on grill duty now."
"Squidward"," But that's SpongeBob's job!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him.  Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.98. Seatbelts not included. "
"Squidward"," Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm—  Mommy, is that you? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers!  Who's ready for another lap?  Keep on truckin' SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? "
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"Squidward"," Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, Tell them I'll be right out."
"Squidward"," Got it.  Ow. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And let's watch the language, Squidward. "
"Mr. Krabs"," My pleasure."
"Squidward"," What the heck is this stuff?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws—  coasters—  bibs—  and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes!  Aww."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get back to work, SpongeBob. I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me.  Whoops!  There you go, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Now what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties. "
"Squidward"," Spongy Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones. "
"Squidward"," Where'd you get them?"
"Mr. Krabs"," They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know."
"Squidward"," You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98. "
"SpongeBob"," All aboard."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy. what a day. What's next? A zombie invasion?  Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, go away, please, I'm busy."
"SpongeBob"," Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies!  Open up, open up, open up, open up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob—  Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's a... It's a Spongy Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what have you done? You poisoned all these people."
"Mr. Krabs"," No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I...  What the...?"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, your honor."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, hang on a second there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Permission to approach the bench, your honor! "
"SpongeBob"," Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position.  Take him around as many times as you like."
"Mr. Krabs","  I love a happy ending."
"Patrick","  No, no!  Yay! "
"Patrick"," Oh.  Nothing satisfies like a good story."
"SpongeBob","  Are ya ready to go, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's me!"
"Patrick"," Sponge-- "
"SpongeBob"," Ew, what's this?"
"Patrick","  Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it!  SpongeBob, what do all these words say?"
"SpongeBob"," It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader."
"Patrick"," That's me!"
"SpongeBob","  Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?"
"Patrick"," I never thought about anything!"
"SpongeBob","  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired."
"Patrick"," I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!"
"SpongeBob"," You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet? "
"Patrick"," Hey, look.  I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's my comic book money!"
"Patrick","  It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick. "
"SpongeBob"," No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back? "
"Patrick"," I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. "
"SpongeBob"," Good luck.  Coming-- "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN! Why won't it make words?"
"SpongeBob"," You have to think of the words yourself. "
"Patrick"," I think I wrote a poem once. "
"Patrick","  Ohh, dodgeballs."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Don't hit me with a dodgeball! "
"SpongeBob"," Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?"
"Patrick"," I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once."
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Patrick"," Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?! "
"SpongeBob","  You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?"
"Patrick"," I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?"
"Patrick"," If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain."
"SpongeBob"," That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. "
"Patrick","  Come on, you stupid brain! work!  It's working! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, don't strain yourself. "
"Squidward"," Now, what's going on?  What is that horrible smell?  Is Patrick thinking again?"
"Patrick"," I'm making art!"
"Squidward"," Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died."
"Patrick"," That's the creative process at work!  Ready to go to the post office?  I need to mail in my masterpiece."
"Patrick"," My song. Ahh... "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, let's hear it!"
"Patrick"," Um, I don't know. You're not gonna throw dodgeballs at me?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work."
"Patrick"," Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable."
"SpongeBob","  Uh, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo! "
"SpongeBob","  It's really loud!"
"Patrick"," You need it louder? Okay!"
"Patrick"," That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was."
"SpongeBob","  oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!"
"Patrick"," Do you really think so?"
"SpongeBob"," We need to get that song on the radio!"
"Patrick"," Then let's go right now, come on! "
"SpongeBob"," Darn, I just got that arm back. "
"Patrick"," I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this. "
"SpongeBob"," Did you see the look on his face?"
"Patrick"," Yeah. Did you see his ears?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?"
"Patrick"," What record? "
"SpongeBob"," I got an idea!  We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna."
"Patrick"," Carry me?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Patrick-- "
"Patrick"," Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward!  Faster, SpongeBob! Faster!  Oh! Hmm-- This record won't stay put."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Good idea. "
"SpongeBob","  "
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. I forgot. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs."
"Patrick"," Uh, Bean Dip?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick! "
"SpongeBob"," Look at that, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches?"
"SpongeBob","  That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!"
"Patrick"," Fan club?  Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius. "
"Patrick"," And that was my new song called, ""Ay..."""
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. My song.  Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star-- "
"Patrick"," Uh-oh. "
"Patrick"," There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry."
"SpongeBob","  Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days."
"Patrick"," Two whole days?! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!"
"Patrick"," Tejas! "
"SpongeBob","  She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds."
"Patrick"," Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here. "
"Squidward","  No, I'm not. "
"SpongeBob"," I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her."
"Patrick"," Is Sandy the one I call Mom?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! "
"Patrick"," Wa-hey! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about...  ...Whoo, right now.  Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya."
"Sandy"," Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy. "
"SpongeBob"," That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy.  First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then..."
"Sandy","  Wow, guys. You two, uh...  Really know how to, uh..  Throw a party."
"SpongeBob"," I knew it! You have been itching to see us."
"Sandy"," Well, something's making my skin crawl."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. "
"Patrick"," This is gonna taste so good again."
"SpongeBob"," Dig in, Sandy.  Uh..."
"Sandy"," Looks... Tasty, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Are you okay, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'."
"Sandy"," Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain."
"SpongeBob"," Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?"
"Sandy"," Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?"
"Sandy","  Rashy sore. I mean, sure."
"SpongeBob"," ] Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?"
"Sandy","  Creepin' critters, feels like somethin's bitin' me.  I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight.  Hi...yah!  I'll get ya.  SpongeBob, my suitcase. Hurry.  I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea. "
"SpongeBob"," What's a flea?"
"Sandy"," A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. "
"SpongeBob","  He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  Ow!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," No, but you can use this one right quick. "
"Patrick"," Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah.  Connect the dots.  I drawed a horsey.  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?"
"Sandy"," 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition."
"Patrick"," I've been bit by a vampire flea!  No!  I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening! Ah, ah! "
"Sandy"," Patrick  there ain't no such thing as vampires."
"Patrick","  Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh! "
"Sandy"," Aah! Gimmie that!  Phew! "
"SpongeBob"," Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please help me! "
"Sandy","  I need this!"
"SpongeBob"," I need it more! "
"Patrick"," Eee! "
"Sandy"," Yah!  Enough! I will not take this anymore!  Whatcha gonna do now, punks?  Looky, it worked. Phew. I'm glad that's over."
"SpongeBob"," Um, is that what over looks like? "
"Sandy"," Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad!  Run!"
"Patrick"," Wah!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"Sandy"," Hey!  Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla.  Run again!"
"SpongeBob"," Aah!"
"Patrick"," Mraah!"
"Sandy"," Aah!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go."
"Patrick"," Yeah, good to see ya. "
"Squidward"," Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe."
"Sandy"," Back off! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? "
"Sandy"," Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!"
"Patrick"," It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain. So much pain. And as for you.  If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute. You had as much to do with this party as I did."
"Patrick"," You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship."
"SpongeBob"," Stop smudging my helmet!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy."
"Sandy","  Would you two men stop yelling at each other?!  What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together."
"Patrick"," You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ah...  Ahhh... Much better.  Whoa!"
"Sandy"," I do not play games.  Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left.  We should be protected here.  Hold on! "
"SpongeBob"," Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?"
"Sandy","  SpongeBob! That's It. Water! "
"SpongeBob"," It sure is good to have you back, Sandy! "
"Patrick"," Wha...? What happened? Where am I!?  Oh yeah, the party! I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling.  See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 830. Things get real crazy after 830! "
"SpongeBob"," Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would? "
"Patrick"," Whooooo! Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge-  That's a good lookin' donut... Wow...  ...This donut's connected to SpongeBob! Oh...  It worked!  A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china!  The good plate.  Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear! I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before...  Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night... "
"SpongeBob"," A donut this nice could really make a guy happy! "
"Patrick","  This is SpongeBob's delicious...  Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut...!  It's SpongeBob's! "
"Patrick","  ...I hate conflicts!"
"Patrick","  And now...  SpongeBob's donut, I ate it!  I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he-  Hello...?"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," That's exactly how I feel about it.  Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again."
"Patrick"," Ah, don't watch that tape..!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over.  Sheesh, Patrick's so excited. I better not keep him waiting!"
"Patrick"," Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut..! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing.  Whew...  Oh... "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, I-  *Gasp* Donut! You monster...! You monster!  Nothing goes with a video like toast, Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy! "
"Patrick"," Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow! "
"SpongeBob"," Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go! "
"Patrick","  ...The attic!  Wait... I don't have an attic!   Oh... Ooh! I know! the attic.  "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to-"
"Patrick"," I don't have anything behind my back! So don't look there! "
"SpongeBob"," Ok... No problem. Ready to see this?  The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy? "
"Patrick"," No!  I took it, SpongeBob! I took your donut...! I'm sorry!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick! You really need to see this video!  I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy... "
"Patrick"," You mean...  This is mine?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course! It was your birthday!"
"Patrick"," ...When?"
"SpongeBob"," ...Last night, silly!"
"Patrick"," Oh... Thanks, buddy!  Hey, Wanna share it?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, pal! "
"Patrick"," Yeah, Pretty good, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, good night, folks. Come again.  Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye."
"Mr. Krabs","  Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?! "
"SpongeBob"," All ready, Mr. Krabs.  Just gotta clock out and..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this? "
"SpongeBob","  Spot, spot, spot!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till..."
"SpongeBob"," ...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done."
"SpongeBob"," Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work."
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  You're a tough little guy, aren't ya?  This means war.  Wait here, please.  Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire!  That is the last straw! I want you to remember...  you made me do this.  Yaahhhh!  I got to finish this.  I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000.  Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials.  I call it...  ...steel wool! And it comes with...  a laser! Any last words?  Mmm... I thought not. Power up.  Water cannon... on.  No effect. Steel wool laser... on! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams!  More power! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to."
"SpongeBob"," More power!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, boy, that can't be good."
"SpongeBob"," More power!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's see what he's done this time. "
"SpongeBob"," Maximum power! Ahhhhh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?"
"SpongeBob","  The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I'll clean your platter!  Come here, you! "
"Plankton"," Ha! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it right there, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll take that. "
"Plankton"," How'd you know it was me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it."
"Plankton"," Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious."
"Mr. Krabs"," You think! SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Wooo-ooo! "
"Plankton"," AAHH!"
"Plankton"," Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!"
"Plankton"," Hey, I resent that!"
"Plankton"," Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless…baby."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies! "
"Plankton","  I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!  Oh, aren't you just too cute. Coochie coochie coo! "
"Plankton"," Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure thing, Plankton.  Here you go, little guy. "
"Plankton"," Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! Hello."
"SpongeBob","  Police! Police!"
"Plankton","  Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  That was easy. I'm free! Free!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula!  What do we do, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break. "
"Plankton","  …and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord."
"Plankton"," Not sure I follow you."
"Plankton"," Yes."
"Plankton"," Uh-huh."
"Plankton"," Right."
"Plankton"," Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob."
"Plankton"," I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  OK, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s? "
"Plankton"," Hands in the air!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton!"
"Plankton"," That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby but Krabs is back to normal?  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote!  One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult.  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahem!"
"Plankton"," Krabs! Nice diaper.  Hold on, hold on! I think I...  Yes, I've got it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Peek-a-boo!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I can't tolerate your stinky gas!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…another penny! Come to papa! Now were we doing?"
"Plankton"," This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh? What was that, sonny?"
"Plankton"," Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless. "
"SpongeBob"," Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!"
"Plankton"," I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! "
"SpongeBob"," I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel."
"Plankton"," This baby gas is worthless!  At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," What was that, sonny?"
"Plankton"," It'll take more time to explain than you have left. "
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!"
"SpongeBob"," Catch who?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Gesundheit."
"Plankton"," Victory is mine! "
"SpongeBob"," Come back here, you little whippersnapper!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm catching up with my knitting."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's it! Knit, little nitwit!"
"Plankton"," That was almost too easy.  What? No! I demand you geezers release me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right after the party. The piñata party. "
"Plankton"," What?"
"Plankton"," Hey, quit it!"
"Plankton"," No!"
"Plankton"," 1 squirt equals baby, carry over the 2 plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it."
"Plankton"," Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?"
"Plankton"," No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing."
"Plankton"," Ow ow ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow ow ow ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!"
"Plankton"," What is it now, Karen?"
"Plankton"," That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig! "
"Plankton"," Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!"
"Plankton"," Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch! "
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong, little feller?  "
"Plankton"," My moment of triumph!  What the...?  Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!"
"Plankton","  Put me down!  Ow!  Stop it! I'm an adult! "
"Plankton"," Yeow!  Huh? I don't believe it! The Krabby Patty formula! He's teething on it!  Give it here, you big stupid baby!  Ow.  I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from you!  Hey! What are you doing?  Uh-oh.  Ahem!  Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!"
"SpongeBob","  Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur. "
"Squidward"," It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!"
"SpongeBob"," Well okay you sit this one out Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef.  For your dining pleasure, 2 double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love.  Enjoy your meal!  It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Oh yeah, you really touched his life. "
"SpongeBob"," Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes."
"Squidward"," Quality food?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," Good people?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. "
"Squidward"," Discriminating tastes?"
"SpongeBob"," Testify!"
"Squidward"," D'oh!  Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect.  There there.  Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right you filthy bilge rats!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! "
"SpongeBob"," What's happening, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!"
"Squidward"," Fancy? Froufrou?"
"Mr. Krabs"," We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! "
"SpongeBob"," Chef exchange program?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes!  Heh, looks like it's early. "
"Squidward"," It was that easy? All these years?  I've underestimated the power of public transportation! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab."
"Squidward"," Does your middle name happen to be ""No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here""? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy."
"Squidward"," But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, right here, sir."
"SpongeBob","  I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than...  Just warming up.  Come on, SpongeBob!  Just one egg then...  No, that's not it, no..."
"SpongeBob"," A Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Squidward, look at this!  We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy. "
"Squidward"," Oh! What is that?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something."
"Mr. Krabs"," So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Shredded...  gold?  Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, well you see those were out of stock."
"SpongeBob"," Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! "
"SpongeBob","  The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab!  So long! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry but I've got to go. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ruined! Busted!  Hello?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents."
"Squidward"," You sold me?!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps."
"Squidward"," You're pathetic! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is it money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Kra-a-abs?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, now I'm scared."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Darn his cursed mocking voice! I...  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientèle back, and rich disgusting new clientèle to boot!  I'm back in business!"
"Squidward"," Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey get back you, eat your own.  Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Mr. Krabs. "
"Patrick"," A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hurry Patrick, hurry!  How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?"
"Patrick"," More like the scrap-heap.  They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again."
"SpongeBob"," OK, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece."
"Patrick"," I'm ready. "
"Patrick","  Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough. "
"SpongeBob"," Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo."
"Patrick"," It's not?"
"SpongeBob"," No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble."
"Patrick"," It Is?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate.  ♪The sun must set at the end of every day.♪  ♪And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.♪  ♪And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.♪ "
"Patrick"," ♪Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese soufflé, it doesn't last all day.♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪I will try again...♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪...To blow a bubble...♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪...That will last all day.♪"
"Patrick"," ♪...All day.♪  Um, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!"
"Patrick"," I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  What have I done!?  We're never gonna get out of here!"
"Patrick"," No!  What happened?"
"SpongeBob","  That's what happened, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Whoa, what is it? It looks really old."
"Patrick"," Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors.  SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birthright! "
"SpongeBob","  My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this ""I hate Mondays"" shirt."
"Mr. Krabs"," Enjoy the artifacts!  Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one.  SpongeBob!  Hew, that was a close one. "
"Squidward"," Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge...  Oh, would you two watch were you're  What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?"
"SpongeBob"," We were just..."
"Squidward"," You're going to steal it!?"
"SpongeBob"," No. Squidward, we'd never..."
"Squidward"," This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... ...ooooome?! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?"
"SpongeBob"," What's an Atlantean omelet?"
"Squidward"," Amulet, not omelet! It's the key to untold riches!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did somebody say untold riches!?"
"Squidward"," Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds."
"Mr. Krabs"," Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of."
"Squidward"," For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!"
"SpongeBob"," Why is this bubble painted on the mural?"
"Squidward"," That's just the oldest living bubble."
"SpongeBob"," The oldest living bubble, alive!  Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!"
"Patrick"," This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen."
"Squidward"," That's just a painting, you quarter-wit!  Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some dumb old bubble pales in comparison to the arts..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Money!"
"Sandy","  And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub, boys?"
"Squidward"," These two chowderbrains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis."
"Sandy"," The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger. "
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!"
"Squidward"," The magical path to Atlantis is a van?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice hot rod flames!"
"Patrick","  What's it doing? "
"Sandy"," Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!"
"Squidward"," Fabulous decor!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Bet there's some loose change in here!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, so this is what luxury feels like."
"Squidward"," Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Does that make any sense?"
"SpongeBob"," No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪  ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪   Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪  ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.♪"
"Plankton"," ♪Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done I plan to make them miiiiine!♪"

"Squidward"," ♪As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis, with their glorious aesthetics, I'll copy their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!♪"
"Patrick"," ♪I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,♪  I don't know what I like."
"Squidward"," Hey look, it's Atlantis."
"SpongeBob"," Pretty!"
"Squidward"," You dimwits haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell."
"SpongeBob"," Ring for the king, huh? "
"SpongeBob"," My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble."
"Mr. Krabs"," What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm Eugene. I like money."
"Plankton"," They're gone. Now to get to those weapons...  Trapped! Ok, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route!  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Comin' through, boys!"
"Plankton"," These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost.  Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else.  Ah hold still, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You're standing on my neck!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, but I feel odd."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'd know that smell anywhere.  Me pockets! They be smelling loot! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Mr. Krabs"," These are me houndstooth pants."
"Mr. Krabs"," As much as me pockets can carry?! ♪Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!♪  ♪Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money!

"Mr. Krabs"," ♪I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press.

"Mr. Krabs"," Are you kidding?! I've just got here!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, shhh!"
"SpongeBob"," No, sir."
"Sandy"," You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?"
"Sandy"," Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear!  What does this gizmo do?"
"SpongeBob"," Comb flavored."
"Sandy"," What else can it turn things into?"
"Sandy"," How's it work?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey cool."
"Patrick"," Where'd SpongeBob go?"
"SpongeBob"," Someone help me!"
"Patrick"," Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to rescue you!"
"Squidward"," Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing!  What's going on here? I... Oh no. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!"
"Squidward"," Help! "
"Sandy"," Sounds like them critters is in trouble!  Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom!  ♪Look out, germs.

"SpongeBob"," Quite."
"Squidward"," Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest."
"Squidward"," This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, I know, I know!"
"Squidward"," I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty."
"SpongeBob"," It looks like my front door!"
"Squidward"," Incredible!  The creativity! The artistry!  This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"Squidward"," This place is amazing!  ♪Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet!

"Squidward"," Looks like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Bye Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, sir this tour has been great and all but uh, can we see the bubble now?"
"SpongeBob"," There it is Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Look at it Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!"
"Patrick"," Like a delicate air raisin!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you Mr. Lord Royal Highness sir.  Just look at it Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look.  Patrick! Get the--"
"Patrick"," Oh golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo, that was a close one buddy!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlantis-eans! "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen."
"Patrick"," Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before we leave."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea Patrick!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick did you hear something?"
"Patrick","  A sort of a popping sound?"
"SpongeBob"," Mmm-hmm."
"Squidward"," I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college."
"Sandy"," They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!"
"Sandy"," I'll show you.  Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!"
"SpongeBob","  We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!"
"Squidward"," What is wrong with you two morons?"
"SpongeBob"," We have to go home now!"
"Squidward"," Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?"
"SpongeBob"," Because, uh, Gary misses me?"
"Patrick"," We destroyed your most prized possession! "
"SpongeBob"," It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!"
"Sandy"," Don't just stand there! Move!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can't you go any faster Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Maybe, if y'all use your feet!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!"
"Sandy"," Come on Patrick!"
"SpongeBob","  That tickles!"
"Sandy"," Hang in there, little buddy! "
"SpongeBob","  Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants.  Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino."
"SpongeBob"," It's not gone, if you believe."
"Plankton","  Cower to me fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath!  Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath!  Oh, you!  Prepare to taste my wrath! "
"Patrick"," Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream."
"Plankton"," Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!"
"Plankton"," I'll destroy all of you--"
"Plankton"," You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of--  Hey! Can't you read?  No flash photography!"

"SpongeBob"," Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque.  Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob","  Fine, not to worry, no problem. "
"SpongeBob"," Still looking good Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner. "
"SpongeBob"," Ketchup?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I... "
"SpongeBob"," And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new...  No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen  of Sponge Gloss.  There it is. So close, and still so shiny.  Hey, it's just water.  Stamps? all over me!  Oatmeal?  Glue. "
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, a little privacy here."
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly."
"SpongeBob"," Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world."
"Patrick"," I have a solution. "
"SpongeBob"," Ew!"
"Patrick"," Ah. I have solved my hunger problem."
"SpongeBob"," That's it!  This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time. "
"Patrick"," We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick..."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly! "
"Patrick"," Huh?! SpongeBob, get out of my taco!  What's the matter, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, can I go home and change first?"
"SpongeBob","  Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't stop crying!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheese.  There I am.  Hey, I don't look so bad after all! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeesh, we need some customers in here.  What's gotten into you?"
"Patrick"," I don't know.  What's happening to me?"
"SpongeBob"," I think I can explain.  Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, he needs one, eh?  Methinks a paying customer's in our midst.  Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?"
"Patrick","  Give me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah, I can pay for it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good boy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," My good man, how you doing?  Excellent. Now, let's get down to business. "
"Patrick"," What's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's your bill."
"Patrick"," I don't have any money."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? I thought you said you could pay for it!"
"Patrick","  Oh, I'm payin' for it all right. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Non-paying customer! "
"Patrick","  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You're gonna pay, one way or another.  All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine.  I'll be back in a while to check up on you.  Bottom-feeding..."
"Patrick"," No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la.  Work, work, work, work."
"Mr. Krabs","  So, Patrick, how are you...?  What in blazes did you do?"
"Patrick","  I accidentally tried the hand soap.  It doesn't taste as good as it smells. "
"Mr. Krabs"," See these ice cube trays?  I want you to put 'em in that bucket."
"Patrick"," How do I do that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Figure it out!"
"Patrick"," Uh... I have to be very gentle. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...? What are you doing?"
"Patrick","  Almost done, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You've destroyed me refrigerator.  You've destroyed many of the things I love.  I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up.  Alls you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so.  See?"
"Patrick"," Yup."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again! "
"Patrick"," Hurry, hurry, hurry! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe."
"SpongeBob"," Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs.  Patrick, what's up buddy?"
"Patrick","  I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down. "
"SpongeBob","  That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're a genius!  Oh, no, there's one left."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, that's not a...  trash bag."
"Patrick","  Why won't you go down? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick? "
"Patrick","  Can I eat now?"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. Blackjack.  Cousin Blackjack's out of prison!?"
"SpongeBob"," That's right, Gary, the cousin Blackjack. The same cousin Blackjack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now.  Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man.  That brute has my parents. I gotta get over there.  Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back."
"SpongeBob"," I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents.  Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? ""Do not cross?"" Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here a crime has been committed. No! Get it together, SquarePants. To face Blackjack, you've got to be as tough as nails.  Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic. The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?  What's this? Blackjack smashed my family portrait. Oh, no. What has he done with my parents? "
"SpongeBob"," That fiend. Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note.  SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm gonna do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack.  He's gonna get Grandma, too. I have to stop him.  Grandma! Where are you? Are you ok? Grandma? You in here? Grandma?  Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp. Oh, that animal. "
"SpongeBob"," Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?"
"SpongeBob"," But where's Blackjack?"
"SpongeBob"," Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?"
"SpongeBob"," Cleaning up the mess?  I got to get help. I'll go to Uncle Cap'N Blue's. He'll know what to do.  Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need your help."
"SpongeBob"," I need you to help me rescue my parents."
"SpongeBob"," Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need to help my parents. They're in danger."
"SpongeBob"," Actually, I came to try to find my..."
"SpongeBob"," Uncle Cap'N Blue, Uncle Cap'N Blue? Please help me."
"SpongeBob","  I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Listen, Cap'N Blue. We don't have much time. Cousin Blackjack has my parents help captive at his house."
"SpongeBob"," That's why we have to rescue them now!"
"SpongeBob"," But Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you."
"SpongeBob"," You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?"
"SpongeBob"," Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy. "
"SpongeBob"," Uncle Cap'n Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home.  Mother!  Mom?"
"SpongeBob"," They're trapped in the basement.  Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here."
"SpongeBob"," Party?"
"SpongeBob"," The fumigator's? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house."
"SpongeBob"," So you two aren't being tortured by Cousin Blackjack?"
"SpongeBob","  To quiver. "
"SpongeBob","  Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time. That's it! I am not gonna take this anymore. I am putting my foot down. You wanna tussle? Well, let's tussle it up!  Cousin Blackjack?"
"SpongeBob"," That tickles."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Blackjack, you haven't changed a bit. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Hup.  There, there. You're safe now little lady. "
"SpongeBob"," So, we meet again, Crazyfish!"
"SpongeBob"," With pleasure!"
"SpongeBob"," You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting.  Hey, that's cheating!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes it is!"
"SpongeBob"," Is too..."
"SpongeBob"," Is too... "
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry! I'm ready! Bring it on! Oh, good morning, Gare-bear."
"SpongeBob"," I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch- villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye. "
"SpongeBob"," Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing."
"SpongeBob"," I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me."
"SpongeBob"," You promise you won't laugh?  Ok, here goes.  Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste.  Thanks for not laughing, Gere. I knew you'd...  Gere...? "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob. Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh!  SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did someone hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. "
"Patrick"," Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm...  Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall."
"Patrick","  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners."
"Patrick"," What did you do?"
"SpongeBob"," I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains."
"Patrick"," With tears?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him."
"Patrick"," Then what happened?"
"SpongeBob"," I woke up... Oh, I mean, I..."
"Patrick"," I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed!"
"SpongeBob"," That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. "
"Patrick"," There goes a real hero."
"SpongeBob","  Slugger, that's me.  What the? "
"Sandy"," Yee-haw! Get along little fishies."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy."
"Sandy"," Whoa!  Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll..."
"SpongeBob"," Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight."
"Sandy"," A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing."
"SpongeBob"," Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget."
"Sandy"," Why? Did he write it down?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I engraved it on his pain gland."
"Sandy"," Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!"
"Sandy"," Jack M. Crazyfish?"
"SpongeBob"," It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage."
"Sandy"," So how'd you get the black eye then?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. "
"Sandy"," Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty! I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. "
"SpongeBob"," That's right. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I'm..."
"SpongeBob"," Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, grandma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye."
"Squidward"," Not really."
"SpongeBob"," All right, who said that?! Was it you, grandma?"
"Squidward"," It was me, I said it. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. "
"Mr. Krabs"," He's right."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  ""Don't worry, I'll save you."" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache..."
"SpongeBob"," I kind of thought it was teal but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess...I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walkin', like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?"
"SpongeBob"," One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, mi lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Noooooooo!..."
"Plankton"," Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock?  Say... Something is going on over there. "
"Squidward"," The Krusty Krab welcomes...  the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals. "
"Plankton","  Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids."
"Mr. Krabs","  at the register and Mr. Krabs holding a bag of Money] Gotta hand it to ya, boy.  Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius."
"SpongeBob","  All in the line of duty, Mr. Krabs.  Isn't it great, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Great?  Those little savages tried to kill me."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but it's so worth it when you get to work in these. "
"Plankton","  Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this? ] Karen?  the exterior of the Chum Bucket with Plankton's Periscope, which shows his eye] My own wife?!  Oh, how Krabs mocks me. "
"Plankton","  What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?"
"Plankton"," Wha...?!  Thanks, babe. You're too good to me.  A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?!  Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man.  Krabs!  Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too.  Ding dong.  Hello, boys. "
"Plankton"," I'm Down Here, Fellas!"
"Plankton","  Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman.  My card."
"Plankton"," Say, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right?  I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin.  Those chiseled features.  That bra.  But what's this? Dandruff?"
"Plankton"," You sure do.  See?"
"Plankton","  Ew!  Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with ""Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo"". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door."
"Plankton","  Wise decision, gentlemen.  Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked.  Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder.  Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's  Mind Control Shampoo!  With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, hey, kids?  Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Back, you! Back! "
"SpongeBob","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry.  Doot, do, doot-do, doot...  Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya.  Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since...  ...since episode 647.  When you blasted that guy's spine.  You still got it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. "
"Plankton","  Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet. "
"Plankton"," Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that... "
"Plankton"," They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties."
"Plankton"," Oh, for crying out loud!  Tell them you hate Krabby Patties! "
"SpongeBob","  Mermaid Man.  I brought you something to refresh your memory. "
"Plankton","  ...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket."
"SpongeBob"," The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this."
"Plankton"," Yes. Yes!   It's working. "
"SpongeBob"," Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties!"
"Plankton"," Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet...  Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow!  Fry Boy...  ...Defender of the Krabby Patty!  Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic! "
"Plankton"," I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers.  In your face, Krabs. Yes!"
"Plankton","  Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far. "
"SpongeBob"," It doesn't make sense.  They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. I know just what to do! "
"SpongeBob"," And the delicious power of Krabby Patties. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, you guys know where to go!"
"Plankton"," Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You forgot to tell me you're leaving! "
"SpongeBob"," Well Patrick, I guess...  I did. "
"Patrick"," I'm gonna miss you, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Me too, Patrick, me too!  Oh Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be... "
"Patrick"," Well, see you later, bud. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, That's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!"
"Patrick"," Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!"
"SpongeBob"," How about now?"
"Patrick"," Yep! "
"SpongeBob","  ...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter.  The rest of my things are right over there. "
"Patrick"," Weee! Haha!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh and quarter, thanks!  Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys?  Guys? "
"SpongeBob","  I had always preferred to recycle. "
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob SquarePants! "
"SpongeBob","  Funny you should ask... once I had..."
"Patrick","  Actually, I am a little hungry."
"Patrick"," The food coma is setting in."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. I could use a nap. "
"SpongeBob"," This camp is very upscale! "
"Patrick"," I had no idea that they had a hot tub! "
"SpongeBob"," It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!"
"Patrick"," Not bad! Except for this aftertaste. "
"SpongeBob"," This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. "
"Patrick"," What's wrong, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me."
"Patrick"," If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other.  Good night! "
"SpongeBob"," That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters! "
"SpongeBob","  Uh... abomination?"
"SpongeBob"," Me, sir! "
"SpongeBob"," It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration! "
"SpongeBob"," Cool! "
"SpongeBob"," All done! "
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee?"
"SpongeBob"," ♪--and you--♪"
"SpongeBob"," Uh... Hey guys! What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," You first."
"Patrick"," I... I like the other island better!"
"SpongeBob"," Me too! "
"Sandy"," What the?  Whoa there! Calm down! Now, tell me what happened."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob and I are being chased by a savage beast!"
"SpongeBob"," And he's going to eat us!"
"Sandy"," Oh, no he ain't!"
"Sandy","  This little guy? Why, he's just a harmless little cricket, he's a land creature just like me! The poor thing must have gotten lost. But he's not going to hurt ya. See? "
"Sandy"," Aahh, let's get you back home you little fella!  There you go! See, that wasn't nothing to be afraid of, huh guys?"
"Sandy","  I don't have time for this, I'm late for my survival training camp."
"SpongeBob"," Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping!"
"Patrick"," Can we come?!"
"Sandy"," This is ain't no ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild, armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite . Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten. You have to be willing to do anything when you're alone in the wild. You two wouldn't last a single day!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Would so!"
"SpongeBob"," We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills!  The Other Day"
"Squidward"," You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Why aren't these things working?!  Out of the Daydream"
"Sandy"," No way, guys! This is a serious trip for hard-core survivalists only!"
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Sshhh!! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!  I guess the road smoothed out.  That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us!"
"Patrick"," Weird. There's a door back here too?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick! No!  Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub.  Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter..."
"Patrick"," And a nice fire to keep us warm."
"SpongeBob"," Say, where did you get the firewood?  You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something!  Hey Patrick, nice job. "
"SpongeBob"," Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we are going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!"
"Patrick"," Gotcha."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Here's the plan..."
"Patrick"," Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. You made the last decision. It's my turn."
"SpongeBob"," Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?"
"Patrick"," Um...maybe,...uh..."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, sorry, take your time. "
"Patrick"," Uhhh...  Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!"
"SpongeBob"," No hurry Patrick."
"Patrick"," Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there."
"SpongeBob"," I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Nice. We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow."
"Patrick"," Aahh, good times."
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?"
"SpongeBob"," We'll be here forever? We're doomed!"
"Patrick"," Are you kidding? That old coot's been here for years! Look at him he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health."
"SpongeBob"," You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep?"
"Patrick"," I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home.  There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller,  comfy, safe and sound in my own little home."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?  Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me."
"SpongeBob","  He's got the taste of flesh!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Sounds like you're hungry."
"Patrick"," Oh, boy am I! I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge..."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," ...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too! "
"SpongeBob"," It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?"
"SpongeBob"," This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick!  He's onto me! Must hide! . Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, , I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here!  Spatula.  Now I just need some buns.  Oh, crunchy.  I can't take it!  I need some real food!"
"SpongeBob"," Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee! "
"Patrick"," Something smells good. What are you cooking SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!"
"Patrick","  Why do you want to eat me?"
"SpongeBob"," I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!"
"Patrick"," Well, not if I eat you first!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no you don't!  Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this?  Warm water?"
"Patrick"," You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, thanks Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?"
"Patrick"," Oops, I forgot the bathbeads! "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks Patrick! You're a real pal!  Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. Carrots?! You're making soup out of me! "
"Patrick"," I was not! It was supposed to be stew!  Whew! I'm getting tired."
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed?  There, that's it. Here, I'll tuck you in with this nice soft blanket , and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup?"
"Patrick"," This isn't a bed!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Come back! You're not properly seasoned! "
"Patrick"," Give me that ketchup back!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Gotcha! "
"Patrick"," No, got you! "
"SpongeBob"," I got you! "
"SpongeBob"," Did what?"
"Patrick"," What?"
"Patrick"," Why do you care if we're survivalists?"
"Sandy"," I'm  Sandy Cheeks! Survivalist extraordinaire!"
"Sandy"," It weren't no accident that you fell out of my truck, I was just testing your survival skills."
"Sandy"," Yup. And I'm happy to say you both passed! Here's your survivalist medals! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry. "
"Patrick"," Me too. "
"Sandy"," Guys? What'cha doing? Aah, fellas?"
"Sandy"," Uh-oh! Next time I'll bring more granola! "
"SpongeBob"," Backing up!  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop..."
"Squidward"," You're better off not knowing."
"SpongeBob"," ...boop, boop, boop!  Your Krabby Patty, sir."
"SpongeBob"," You mean with a smile? Yes, sir! "
"Patrick"," Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho!  The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!"
"SpongeBob"," Not the mollusks!"
"Patrick"," Mollusks? What mollusks?"
"SpongeBob"," There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks! "
"Patrick"," It's too bad nobody listened to him."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative."
"Patrick"," Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate.  Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A-a-a watch.  See?"
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't that hurt?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Every time!"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family."
"Patrick"," Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor.  I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out. "
"Sandy"," HI-YAH!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop."
"SpongeBob"," Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas. "
"SpongeBob"," Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me."
"Sandy"," Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there was my uncle Sherm.  He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose. "
"Sandy"," That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Lets do a little digging around your family tree. "
"Sandy"," ""Family Histories of Bikini Bottom"". Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here! "
"SpongeBob"," Gasp!"
"Sandy"," It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?"
"Sandy"," Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days.  It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town. "
"Sandy"," Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good gloot, Dead Eye!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!"
"SpongeBob"," So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa.  It was much better than that one we have now. "
"Sandy"," Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, "
"Sandy"," Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?!  That boy ain't hooked up right."
"SpongeBob"," Look, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," HUH? "
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBuck was here all the long! Sorry Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop."
"Sandy"," Wow!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!"
"Sandy"," Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming. "
"SpongeBob"," Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over."
"Patrick"," Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan."
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?"
"Patrick"," Oh, wait I got it. Ringo..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over."
"Patrick"," Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Please reply."
"Patrick"," I wonder if I can order pizza with these things."
"SpongeBob"," Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be."
"SpongeBob"," I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud...  ... noises."
"Patrick"," Oops. "
"SpongeBob"," Is he still after us, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Should we turn around and check?"
"Patrick"," Ok. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I think I landed on my pain center."
"Patrick"," I think I landed on a rock. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there."
"Patrick"," That's just Squidward sunbathing again. "
"SpongeBob"," No, not that, Patrick. This!"
"Patrick"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up."
"Patrick"," We?"
"SpongeBob"," Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'll say. "
"SpongeBob"," Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO!  Go on, you first.  Kinda dark, huh?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, dark."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir.  Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!"
"Patrick"," Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive."
"SpongeBob"," Gimme that wheel!"
"Patrick"," No! Let go! I wanna drive! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition."
"Squidward"," Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?"
"Squidward"," La la la la la la la la la la la la."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, of course! But how? "
"SpongeBob"," Can we park here?  Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey."
"Patrick"," Or even around the block!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road.  So long, boys. Make me lots of money!"
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Bye, Squidward."
"Patrick"," You said ""Bye, Squidward"" twice."
"SpongeBob"," I like Squidward."
"Plankton","  A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?"
"Patrick"," Now what?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back.  Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! We'll pay ya!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, sir, come again!"
"Plankton"," Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected. "
"Plankton"," Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?"
"Plankton"," Um, no."
"Plankton"," No."
"Plankton"," Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!"
"Plankton"," I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers."
"Plankton"," I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is."
"Plankton"," Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!"
"Plankton"," You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here.  What the?  No! Controls malfunctioning! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty?  Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?"
"SpongeBob"," Folks, have I got a deal for you. "
"SpongeBob"," Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," No, but I see a sign. It says. ""Warning Ab...eyes?"""
"SpongeBob"," Here, let me see.  No, Patrick, that says ""Abyss."""
"Patrick"," Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," An abyss is a bottomless...  ...chasm!  Pat, we're falling!"
"Patrick"," And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!"
"Plankton","  Yes! Yes!"
"Patrick","  And now a deafening warning siren! "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! "
"SpongeBob"," Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?"
"SpongeBob"," Then try one of our Krabby Patties."
"Patrick"," Order... uh... up! "
"Plankton"," Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. , he rips off the periscope] This calls for drastic-er-est measures!  Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Patrick","  Neither do I!"
"Plankton"," Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the...  Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, look!"
"SpongeBob"," What is it?"
"Patrick"," It's a liquid."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's a solid! It's a solid!"
"SpongeBob"," But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich."
"SpongeBob","  Anything else before we shove off?"
"SpongeBob"," We- We don't have desserts."
"Plankton","  Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... "
"Plankton"," No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey! "
"Squidward"," Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the... "
"SpongeBob"," We're back, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!"
"SpongeBob"," You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't care about that. Tell me about the money."
"SpongeBob"," There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy."
"Patrick"," And paper."
"Mr. Krabs"," You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?"
"SpongeBob","  But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!"
"Patrick"," Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here. "
"Patrick","  How about now?"
"SpongeBob","  Right by my side.  Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other  let's get them, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?"
"Patrick"," You...found a new best friend?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what are you...  Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look out, behind you!!"
"Patrick"," Noooo! You're not my best friend!"
"SpongeBob"," We gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals! "
"SpongeBob"," We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat."
"Patrick"," You mean like those guys? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement."
"Patrick"," Look at these guys!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?"
"SpongeBob"," There was a battle of Bikini Bottom? "
"Patrick"," Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies "
"Patrick"," And those who had more important things to do with their time. "
"Patrick"," And that's how we won our right to wash as we please. "
"SpongeBob","  You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!"
"Patrick"," Never have, never will."
"SpongeBob"," Echhh!"
"Patrick"," Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone. "
"SpongeBob"," That's ok. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, I said..."
"Patrick","  Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," Here, I'll get it. "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me."
"Patrick"," Well, then I guess we can't be friends."
"SpongeBob"," What are you saying?"
"Patrick"," Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U...R... huh... How do you spell ""not my friend""?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you. "
"Patrick"," No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs."
"SpongeBob"," But being clean is so much better."
"Patrick"," Well, says you. I like dirty."
"SpongeBob"," Clean!"
"Patrick"," Dirty!"
"SpongeBob"," Clean!"
"SpongeBob"," Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!"
"Patrick","  Fine, me too!"
"SpongeBob"," Ha! Got your nose!"
"Patrick"," Hey, give it back!"
"SpongeBob"," Not until you wash your hands!"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah? Well  I got your eyeballs! "
"SpongeBob","  Eww, brain juice!"
"Patrick","  Do you give up yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me."
"Patrick"," Your pants are falling down."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," I'll fix it. "
"SpongeBob"," Satisfied?"
"Patrick"," There, you look good now."
"SpongeBob"," You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet."
"Patrick"," Why, what's wrong with them? ]"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I'll take care of it. "
"Patrick"," No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail Polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!"
"SpongeBob"," You, sir, could use some dental hygiene! "
"Patrick"," Who, me? My teeth are fine, see? "
"SpongeBob"," A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  You gotta brush in little circles! "
"Patrick","  Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!! "
"SpongeBob"," You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this! "
"Patrick"," No! No, not...not deodorant! "
"Patrick","  My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah? "
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh, booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Gold? Heehee! "
"Squidward"," Did you get any of Patrick's ""gold""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for."
"Patrick"," Ha! I got you now!"
"SpongeBob","  Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon! "
"Patrick","  Raw onions?!!  That does it!  See this?"
"SpongeBob"," A Krabby Patty? What are you gonna do, eat it?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm not going to eat it. "
"SpongeBob"," No, not Patty socks!"
"Patrick"," That's right, your precious Patties on my stinky feet! "
"SpongeBob"," You better stop that!"
"Patrick","  Stinky, little feet! "
"SpongeBob","  Ergggg, you stop that right now! "
"Patrick"," Hoppin'...  ..Claaams!  Hey, I got my filth back!"
"SpongeBob"," Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you! "
"Patrick","  No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!"
"SpongeBob"," Try me!"
"Patrick","  Stay back, I'll do it!"
"SpongeBob"," It's too late for that! "
"Patrick","  My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm covered in muck and scum!"
"Patrick"," Man! To get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!"
"SpongeBob"," It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need 20 baths a day!"
"Patrick"," Slather toe jam on my armpits?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!"
"Patrick"," Smear slime on my teeth?"
"SpongeBob"," And dry-clean my uvula!"
"SpongeBob"," Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean."
"Patrick"," And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, thank you."
"SpongeBob","  Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Squeaky clean, squeaky, squeaky "
"SpongeBob","  Mmm-hmm, he has embraced the truth."
"SpongeBob"," And what is that, my son?"
"SpongeBob"," Come, Patrick, my work here is done. "
"SpongeBob","  Good morning, Gary! Good morning, Mister Mailman!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends..."
"Squidward"," Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare."
"SpongeBob"," The best job..."
"Mr. Krabs"," He's already 10 seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this."
"SpongeBob"," And, of course, the bestest pet."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry! I'm sorry! "
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick! How goes it?"
"Patrick"," Well, it was great until you showed up. "
"SpongeBob"," What's that?"
"Patrick"," Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. I'm gonna go back and make a 2nd b-day cake that my mom will like. Idiot Boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy. "
"Sandy"," It's all done! My greatest invention yet! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! What a neat robot! "
"Sandy"," No!! "
"SpongeBob"," Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise."
"Sandy"," Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got!  Get out of here! Idiot Boy!"
"SpongeBob","  I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not!  SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping."
"SpongeBob"," No worries, captain!  Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up... "
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar.  What the barnacles is going on?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you OK?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm fine, as long as me money's OK. "
"Mr. Krabs","  If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy! "
"SpongeBob","  I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me ""Idiot Boy"", it must be true. I know what must be done!  I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gary?"
"SpongeBob","  I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you.  Goodbye, pineapple.  Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it.  Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538.  Minus 1.  Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy...  Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump. I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concussion. "
"Sandy"," Patrick, where's SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake. "
"Sandy"," We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," Gary? Where are you, little guy? "
"Sandy"," Gary? Gary? "
"Sandy"," Gary! What happened to you?"
"Sandy"," A note.  To whom it may concern if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello there.  What's going on?"
"SpongeBob","  Are you talking to me?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, is it?"
"SpongeBob"," All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything. "
"SpongeBob","  CheeseHead, huh?  Wait a minute, what's this? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!"
"Squidward"," If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't talk back to your superior officer, you..."
"Sandy"," Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," I think we just went through this..."
"Mr. Krabs"," What he means to say is, no, we haven't."
"Sandy"," Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see that.  To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means  sincerely... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?!"
"Patrick"," What am I gonna do without my best friend?! I should never have been mean to you! "
"Sandy"," I should have never kicked you out of my house! "
"Squidward","  If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob--  I would have slammed the door in his face even harder! "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, all right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!  Now...  how do you propose we find me money-making employee?"
"Sandy"," Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," You do?"
"Sandy"," Yup, and it involves this.  It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius."
"Squidward"," So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?"
"Sandy"," You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find-- "
"Squidward","  Oops, I dropped it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," MR. SQUIDWARD!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape! And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!"
"Squidward","  I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea."
"Mr. Krabs"," If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever."
"Squidward"," Ha! Is that your version of a threat?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any–  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not so fast!  Bring back me number one fry cook first."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Patrick","  Buddy? You there? "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!  Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"Sandy"," There he is, guys!"
"Patrick"," Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter."
"Sandy"," That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. There's SpongeBob. "
"Patrick","  I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now? "
"Sandy"," Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"Sandy"," Now let's see what that little critter's up to.  New mayor of...  SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!"
"Sandy"," CheeseHead BrownPants?"
"Sandy"," Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob."
"Sandy"," Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy."
"Sandy"," Surprised I found you?"
"Sandy","  It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you? "
"Sandy"," You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back."
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, wait! "
"Squidward"," Don't just stand there, get in."
"Sandy"," Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here I come. "
"Sandy"," Here it is! You must recognize this place."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping."
"Squidward"," Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook you gotta pay up."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg."
"Squidward"," Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  STOOOOOP! "
"Sandy"," You OK, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand-  Hey, I remember this place."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob's back!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back."
"SpongeBob"," I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Good-bye, everyone."
"Squidward"," He's leaving, again!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Where's SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Order up!  Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend? "
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty!  SpongeBob, another masterpiece."
"Sandy"," It's great to have you back, Spongy."
"SpongeBob","  Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever."
"Squidward","  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards. "
"Squidward","  excuse me for just a second."
"Squidward"," Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might wanna try it sometime!"
"SpongeBob"," I sure would, Squidward. That sounds... "
"Patrick"," Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah!"
"Squidward"," Remind me to fire my therapist.  And stop bringing your neighbors to work!"
"Patrick"," We're not just neighbors."
"SpongeBob"," You can say that again!"
"Patrick"," We're not just... "
"Squidward"," I don't care!  $4.19, please."
"Squidward","  Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but... "
"SpongeBob","  She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!"
"SpongeBob"," No! don't tell me! I can't take it! "
"SpongeBob"," No, please. Just... just don't."
"SpongeBob"," Two weeks? I'll never make it. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning Nurse Rechid.  Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you. "
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. "
"SpongeBob","  Hiya Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," It has been two weeks already? . Don't worry doc. I promise to stay out of the way."
"SpongeBob"," Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera?"
"SpongeBob"," Very well, doctor. Carry on."
"SpongeBob"," Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Squidward"," How does it look?"
"SpongeBob"," Great Neptune..."
"Squidward"," Come on. Spit it out. I can take it."
"Squidward"," What did she call me?"
"SpongeBob"," Handsome. But she spelled it wrong."
"Squidward"," Quick, hand me that mirror!  What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before."
"SpongeBob"," If that's even possible."
"Squidward"," Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome."
"Squidward"," Oh, don't worry."
"Squidward"," Huh? Well, better go greet the commoners."
"Squidward"," Good morning my people! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I  strange as it seems, need my beauty sleep."
"Squidward"," I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger. "
"Squidward"," Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from...Hey! "
"Squidward","  There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure.  Hey my grandmother gave me that soap! Well no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to.. "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my old life back."
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm... I know just what to do. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person, everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward."
"Squidward"," We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back."
"Mr. Krabs"," And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3."
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose."
"Squidward"," You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, ok..."
"Squidward"," Now don't hold back, SpongeBob. Just really let me have it."
"SpongeBob"," Just remember Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you."
"Squidward"," Uhh... okay, just let me just memori...  Dooowww! Hey, I wasn't ready.  Would you mind waiting till I... "
"SpongeBob"," Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again.  Nope. Still too handsome.  It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough. "
"Squidward"," Spo... hang on a sec  ... let me... uhhhh... "
"SpongeBob"," Yeeks! Squidward! You're even more handsome now!  And the crowd is in a frenzy."
"Squidward"," Well, SpongeBob, it was you who got me into this mess, now you have to get me out again!"
"SpongeBob"," I know Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just need... "
"Squidward","  Got me into..."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Look out for that falling shoe!"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward..."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," You're back! Oh, Squidward...I love you no matter how many times we smash your face."
"Squidward"," I almost wish that meant something. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, where you going? Don't leave me! Please! I'm beggin' ya! Look. I can make him handsome again. Watch!  See?  He's getting handsome. It just takes a little  effort, just a little  elbow grease. Please! Come back!"
"SpongeBob"," Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles! "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Jelly, out you go. It's been a lot of fun, but I gotta get to work.  Quite a wind this morning, eh Jelly.  Whoa!  Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I can't play right now?  Stop it!  Whoa!  Oh! I'm going to be late!  I told you I don't have time to play right now!  I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook and I'm not going to start today! "
"SpongeBob"," I gotta call for some help.  My fingers are too big for the buttons. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, this be the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! I need you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Where you been, customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!  and lands on his face, then gets in line]"
"SpongeBob"," I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Jellyfish?"
"SpongeBob"," They're attracted to my whistley holes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, I'll never understand what you just said, but if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing.  Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight.  Fightin' too hard!  Gotta reel him in, Krabs. Cut a little slack,  then yank!  Cut some slack, then yank!  There he is. Ready for work. Quit whining, boy, and start pushing out them patties."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, sir.  Let's get these patties started right!  That gives me an idea.  Oh, no. They found me. "

"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat. So let's sell 'em- I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!"

"SpongeBob"," Actually, ma'am,  it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that's right."
"Mr. Krabs","  Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...! "
"SpongeBob"," Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Okay."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad.  She can't close us down."
"Mr. Krabs","  She closed us down! I'm ruined!  How did it come to this?"
"Squidward"," You called Ms. Gristlepuss a disgusting old prune, then you threatened her with a french-fry strainer."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!"
"Squidward"," How long has he been standing over there?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, 4 days."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's no use!  I'm ruined! "
"SpongeBob"," You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's it! A secret Krusty Krab.!  And I know just where to open it."
"Mr. Krabs"," There ya are, Betsy! Good as new! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I-"
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, lad, I can remember a time when people used to knock before entering someone else's home!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but...this  my home."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah..."
"Patrick"," Hey guys!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today!"
"Patrick"," You bet! Where do you want these extra buns? "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, that bag is totally empty."
"Patrick"," Oops."
"Plankton"," Happy day, Karen! That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the closed Krab! Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead! He'll be ruined by tomorrow!  What an idiot!"
"Plankton"," What?"
"Plankton"," Banned? Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last! I won, I tell you! I've won! And what better way than by default? "
"Plankton"," Oh, out to celebrate.  Don't wait up for me! "
"Plankton"," Excuse me, gents! But what's with all the hullabaloo?"
"Plankton"," Krabby Patty?! "
"Patrick","  Thank you, come again!  Can I help whoever's next, please?  What's the password, please?"
"Plankton"," What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?"
"Patrick"," That's it!  Come right in!"
"Plankton"," Curse you! "
"Squidward"," So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Squidwart. You haven't seen any sign of... you know...  the cops! Have ya?"
"Squidward"," Did you just call me ""Squidwart""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, thanks. I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing.  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?"
"SpongeBob"," If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya... usually succeeds in the second attempt."
"SpongeBob"," But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!"
"SpongeBob","  Nooooooo!"
"Plankton","  So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!"
"Plankton","  Being a ruthless mastermind sure takes a lot outta ya. "
"Plankton"," Cops, I need you!"
"Patrick","  What's the pas-  Nope, that's not it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?"
"SpongeBob"," Ms. Gristlepuss! Look out!"
"SpongeBob"," Your shoe's untied!"
"SpongeBob","  ♪La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪  Really neat. "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Treat that's neat!♪"
"SpongeBob"," Does that mean you're not sending us to the Slammer?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't forget the spatula! "
"Plankton","  Darn it! Argh! Once again, so close and yet so far! When am I gonna- oh! "
"Plankton"," Oh dear. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, somebody left me a package! Ahhhhhh ohhhhhhhh ah heavy! I wonder what's inside."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Cousin Stanley!"
"SpongeBob"," So what brings you to Bikini Bottom, Stanley?"
"SpongeBob","  Dear SpongeBob. I'm sending your cousin Stanley to live with you. He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, you're always welcome here, Stanley! My pineapple is your pineapple."
"SpongeBob"," Oh well, now I don't have to clean it out."
"SpongeBob","  Stanley! You OK in there Stanley?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it was bath night."
"SpongeBob"," Why not? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway.  Nothing..."
"SpongeBob"," I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that. That's me making Krabby Patties! The best job in the world. It's my calling."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Stanley. You just haven't found your purpose in life, that's all!"
"SpongeBob"," I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you!  Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley."
"Squidward"," There's two of them?! "
"Squidward"," Step on it! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's okay. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. She's a scientist! "
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob. Who's your friend?"
"SpongeBob"," This is my cousin, Stanley SquarePants. I thought you could teach him how to be a scientist."
"Sandy"," Why, sure! Glad to meet you, partner."
"Sandy"," Uh oh.  Yall... darn it!"
"SpongeBob"," Err... Maybe you're not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius!  And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you."
"Patrick"," Looking for your calling, huh?  Hmmm... So, what are you good at?"
"Patrick"," Nothing at all?"
"Patrick"," Interesting. Let's see how good you are at nothing."
"SpongeBob"," That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone!  You'll be learning from the master!"
"Patrick"," Come with me. First, sit down on this chair. Clear your mind. Empty it off all thoughts... until you're doing... absolutely... nothing. "
"Patrick"," You're not worthy for instruction in the immobile arts. Leave my presence!"
"Patrick"," Good-bye! Not a word!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking!  Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Cornerstone of my eternal happiness! I don thee now, in preparation, for this workday.  Wooo! You have no idea how this feels."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Maybe seeing me totally fulfilled with cheer you up."
"Mr. Krabs"," There's me little money maker!  Are you gonna make me lots of money today?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, what i give if only there are two of what? One, two? There's two?! He looks like you. He smells like you. He tastes like you! Is he a hard worker, just like you?"
"SpongeBob"," Um... Uh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, is he?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir."
"Mr. Krabs","  You've got the job!"
"SpongeBob","  Your job is to take people's money, and put it in here! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Money?  Burning?!  SpongeBob!? Who's responsible for this!?"
"SpongeBob"," I... guess I am, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're on probation, boy!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, Stanley. Thanks to you, I'm on probation. If you wanna keep this job, you're gonna have to...  Woo! Customer at the port bow! Man your stations! Man your stations!  Ready for duty!"
"SpongeBob"," I said I'm ready Stanley.  Whoa! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! What's the meaning of this? Your station looks horrible. Take some pride in your work, boy! Look at your cousin Stanley, for example. Spiffing up his workplace with meaningful photos of the customers! "
"SpongeBob","  Um...sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," About my cousin Stanley?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes. The one I hired entirely on your recommendation. Hurry up, boy."
"SpongeBob"," About what I said..."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? You didn't lie to me just so your cousin could get the job, did ya?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, good. Because there are plenty of other relatives that got passed over for the job!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I even turned down my three adorable nephews."
"Mr. Krabs"," They solve mysteries.  Now go solve the mystery of why you didn't get the job!"
"SpongeBob"," Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you!  No! Not my spatula! My spatula...  The thing I hold nearest and dearest to my heart..."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what in the name of Neptune is going...? Oh. You broke your spatula. That's a shame. I'll order another one tomorrow, boy."
"SpongeBob","  No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute...I know the perfect job for you! "
"SpongeBob","  Good luck on your new job, cousin Stanley!"
"Plankton"," Good morning, Mr. SquarePants!"
"Plankton"," I can't believe it! That fool Krabs hiring the blood relative of his best worker!  Well, that's the end of me."
"Squidward"," Oh.  Hello. Hello.  Hellooo!"
"Squidward","  This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?"
"Squidward"," I was, until you called."
"Squidward"," Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?"
"Squidward"," Who's that talking in the background?"
"Squidward"," Hey, that's no better than my house! "
"Squidward","  It's simply glorious!"
"Squidward"," Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!"
"Squidward"," Really!"
"Squidward","  Two hours? But I haven't even got time to wash my hair.  There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just...  There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect.  Oh no!  I'll never get this place in shape in time!  SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm... What day is it?"
"Squidward"," It's the day you go away, and never come back."
"SpongeBob"," But Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?"
"Squidward"," How'd you know about that?"
"SpongeBob"," I was spying on you."
"Squidward"," Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because...  All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo? "
"SpongeBob"," Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! "
"Squidward"," All right, first of all I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right."
"SpongeBob"," Well that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend."
"Squidward"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," No, not really... He traded me these 2 chocolate bars for it."
"Squidward"," I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what was that noise?  Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it all looked kinda faded. "
"Squidward"," Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?"
"Squidward"," Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say...  Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't...  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Squidward"," Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say...  Ow! Why do you keep moving it?"
"SpongeBob"," Cause you keep saying ow! "
"Squidward"," I don't need you, I can move it myself. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. "
"Squidward"," Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!"
"SpongeBob"," Roger!  Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. "
"Squidward"," Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the? "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. "
"Squidward"," Come out of there.  Uh, hang on please.  Please, just one more minute Nick! "
"Patrick"," Who's Nick? Sorry Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks.  Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks. "
"Patrick"," Oh, hey Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here.  See ya! "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you Patrick! "
"Squidward"," Oh no! "
"Squidward"," I have-... I have?"
"Squidward"," Why, yes. I've studied him for... years! "
"Squidward"," Yay! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. "
"Plankton"," Ha-ha! Those fools will never find me now!  Oh come on, baby. You know how long I've been in stir."
"Plankton"," After everything I've done for you."
"Plankton"," Well, that's just great.  Hey! It's my old guitar. I used to play it, when I was in that band, as a kid. Man, those were good times.  Okay everybody! One two… one two three!  You know, I don't think I've had any good times."
"SpongeBob","  ♪Oh I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah! A teaspoon of *raspberry*♪  ♪Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song.♪"
"Plankton","  He's singing about the Krabby Patty. If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Mix in some…♪"

"Plankton"," But could you explain those ""wee"" parts?"
"SpongeBob","  ♪And when I'm done, I chop up some… Love.♪"
"Plankton","  Gahh!  Are you out of your mind? Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Plankton.  Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics."
"Plankton"," Oh, that's terrible. Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you! Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!"
"SpongeBob","  I know what you're doing!"
"Plankton"," What, me? I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!"
"SpongeBob","  You want me to… join your band!"
"Plankton"," What band? I don't have a band."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!"
"Plankton"," Songs?  Yes! And you can teach me your Krabby Patty songs!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I've got big news!"
"Patrick"," Me too! Me too!"
"SpongeBob"," What's your news?"
"Patrick","  I found out where boogers come from "
"SpongeBob"," Ew, really?"
"Patrick","  Uh-huh. What's your news?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band!  Can Patrick join our band?"
"Plankton"," Sure, whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Hear that, Patrick. You're in."
"Patrick"," All right! I play a mean belly. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous! "
"Squidward"," Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward… "
"Squidward"," What the…"
"SpongeBob"," Would you help us by joining our band?"
"Squidward","  Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes…  playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans…  clapping, demanding encores, cheering me…  Oh, uh, changed my mind. I'll join your band and help you bottom feeders…  BUT I gotta get in shape first! "
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us!"
"Plankton"," Hmm? Uh yea, great. "
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this?"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, with just a little more…"
"Patrick","  Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," You know, Pizzazz!"
"Patrick","  Perhaps you didn't notice… My new hairdo."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!"
"Patrick"," And unlike your nasty, little wig…  Mine is real! "
"SpongeBob"," Man, how'd you grow that so fast?"
"Patrick"," Natural talent, watch this… "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo, yeah!  Dig that fancy follicle work!"
"Patrick"," Hey, check this one out. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this. "
"Squidward"," Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, aren't you coming to band practice?"
"Squidward","  Are you kidding? I've got a lot of work to do before I'm famous! "
"SpongeBob","  Ok, then, we'll keep your seat warm.  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'm on it. "
"Plankton","  Greetings, fellow band-mates."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Plankton, what's that?"
"Plankton","  T-shirts."
"SpongeBob"," Ah…  ""Plankton and the… Patty Stealers""?"
"Plankton","  Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh…"
"SpongeBob"," I… LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious."
"Patrick"," Can I get mine in pink?  It looks like a tattoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this?  And then turn into one of those songs that goes… "
"Plankton","  Yes, perfect, now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?"
"SpongeBob"," Or… One about my new friend Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Stop it! "
"SpongeBob"," Or the adventures of…"
"Plankton","  The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know…  Secret recipe."
"Patrick"," I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this. "
"SpongeBob","  Is that what you mean, Plankton?"
"SpongeBob"," What is that?"
"Plankton"," It's my… uh… recording equipment. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, my gosh! What do I do?"
"Plankton","  Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in.  Now just relax and let the equipment do its job. let's see what's locked in his subconscious. "
"SpongeBob","  ♪Time to feed him. Time to feed him. Now it's Gary's feeding time. Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow.♪"
"Plankton"," Nope "
"SpongeBob","  ♪Brush, brush, brush my teeth. Gently keep them clean.♪"
"Plankton"," The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere.  What's going-  I'm a failure."
"SpongeBob"," Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab."
"Plankton","  At the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, but Old Man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there."
"Plankton"," When nobody's there? "
"Squidward"," My perfect dream-body. "
"Plankton"," Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!"
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Plankton"," Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me."
"SpongeBob"," Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you. "
"SpongeBob"," We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band."
"SpongeBob"," Got a, uh, what? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes? "
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, officer.  They're gone."
"Plankton"," You will never speak of this to anyone.  Come on, come on, hurry up."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I just need to get the key out. "
"Plankton"," Give me that, you incompetent fool.  Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula is mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time!  Now where does Krabs keep that formula?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoo, let's rock!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," We're gonna be stars!"
"SpongeBob","  All right! Squidward, are you ready?"
"Squidward","  I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," OK! Patrick, are you ready?  Plankton, are you ready?  Plankton?  PLANKTON! "
"Plankton"," Uh… I'm ready?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?"
"Plankton"," What, no, I was in it for the music, man!"
"Plankton"," Well, at least I'm back to my old cell."
"Plankton"," But I liked my old cell."
"SpongeBob","  There's no time to waste, Plankton.  We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two…"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, well, this one time I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't think so. Ooh wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there too."
"Mr. Krabs"," What does that mean?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, wait! I'll take 'em."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago. "
"SpongeBob","  Sir... Sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, I am?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I mean why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs too you know!  How about a little music.  Okay, okay, get a grip Krabs. Just concentrate on driving.  Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin.  Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second.  I gotta have that penny!  Good morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Find anything special lately?"
"SpongeBob"," Yae-yes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! Well, share it with me!"
"SpongeBob","  I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wha.. What?"
"SpongeBob"," The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Don't talk to me."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today."
"Squidward"," That counts as talking. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Hello again Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What can I do you for?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can I borrow a penny?"
"SpongeBob"," A penny? Sure.  Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now."
"Mr. Krabs"," But did you check all your pockets?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I thought I did."
"Mr. Krabs"," Front pockets? "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, no."
"Mr. Krabs"," Back? "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm-mm."
"Mr. Krabs"," Shirt pockets? "
"SpongeBob"," Nuh-uh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Shoe pockets?"
"SpongeBob","  Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous."
"Mr. Krabs"," It is?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I do have a tie pocket though.  No, not in there either."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, maybe it fell in your sock."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you check there?  Uhh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey look, it's my brain!  Hey where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh?"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, uhh, no penny, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Darn! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working."
"Squidward"," Me too."
"SpongeBob"," Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?"
"Squidward"," Never. "
"SpongeBob"," The sounds are coming from back here. What the? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Careful with those marquee ladders!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes I did."
"SpongeBob"," Yay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... "
"Mr. Krabs"," ...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by..."
"Mr. Krabs"," by a... by a plucky young sponge."
"SpongeBob"," Just like me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right! And the best part is admission is only one penny!"
"Squidward"," Does a movie like that even exist?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, well, actually I was going to show you this flip book and..."
"Squidward"," A flip book?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, wait. Noooooooo!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course you can lad! You just gotta give me one penny."
"SpongeBob"," But, but..."
"Mr. Krabs"," But what?"
"SpongeBob"," But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. Oh well. "
"Squidward"," Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? You look beautiful!"
"Squidward"," Let me show you to your table."
"SpongeBob"," My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty You can donate one penny to me Mr. Krabs. Also known as Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," I would like to donate a penny."
"Mr. Krabs"," You would?"
"SpongeBob"," If I only had one! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that? You! You know where!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tell where!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It wasn't?"
"SpongeBob"," No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah well, good night, Gary. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging."
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot!  See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! "
"SpongeBob"," Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa!  What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow.  I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 800 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started.  All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about.  ""Chapter 1 In the beginning, Neptune created the sail."""
"SpongeBob"," ""...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.""  Time for a little shuteye before...  Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow?  Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow!  Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," No worries, I made it."
"SpongeBob"," I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself.  Hey, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," I made this for you."
"SpongeBob","  This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you know which boat is fastest on record?"
"SpongeBob"," Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure?  Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know...  Ever been on a... "
"SpongeBob"," Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance."
"SpongeBob"," No problemo, Mrs. P. }"
"SpongeBob"," I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers."
"SpongeBob"," Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day."
"SpongeBob","  With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws,  it'll get your spices where they need to go."
"SpongeBob"," It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license."
"SpongeBob"," ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's  odor strongly resembled.  For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people who already lived there.  You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob","  I knew it!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard.  And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there.  A/C, hmmm...That's short for ""automatic conditionata"", and that's fancy fancy talk for ""Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!""  Whew.  Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, ma’am. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Innocent lives?!"
"SpongeBob"," The only one...that can...save...them?!"
"SpongeBob"," STOP!!! I know what to do.  I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches.  Next, lower anchor.  Oh no!  The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back.  Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. "
"SpongeBob","  And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built,  is to perform the Reverse 7/20 Tail Spin."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, it hasn't.  NOT UNTIL NOW.  "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! At long last!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh gosh.  Headlights are on! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...♪  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, Mr. K.  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Code blue?!  What's the matter boy?"
"SpongeBob"," I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life."
"Mr. Krabs"," Man alive!  He's taking us down!"
"Plankton","  Get ready Krabs,  for the surprise of your life!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Brace yourself!  Huh?  Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition.  What is that? "
"Plankton"," Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum!  I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling!  I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict!  My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free!  Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators."
"Plankton","  Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement."
"Plankton"," This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!"
"Plankton"," I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife.  Uh, sorry, honey."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!  Where's all my loyal customers?"
"Squidward"," They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street."
"Mr. Krabs"," That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,"
"Mr. Krabs"," ... but when he steals me customers, then I push back! Gentlemen, to the coliseum!  This reeks of evil. And I'm going to sniff out the source. "
"Plankton"," Welcome one and all, to the first bi-annual big arena of annihilation! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!"
"Plankton"," Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin! "
"SpongeBob"," Yay!  Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go against that beast!"
"Squidward"," You call this fun? This is just cheap, uncultured lay sport."
"Plankton"," Now, release the opponent."
"SpongeBob"," Yes!  Patrick? How could they? This is horrible! "
"Squidward"," This is fabulous! "
"Plankton"," Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages! "
"Patrick"," All right! "
"Plankton"," That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!"
"Patrick"," Ohh. Nice kitty.  Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty... sausage.  Spawn of a gefilte fish! "
"SpongeBob","  I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there!  Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What? Oh, oh it's you. Hey, how's it going buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," No time for chit chat, get in!  Hurry up Nelly!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mom!"
"Plankton"," This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2!  Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?"
"Plankton"," Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality."
"Plankton"," Just ten dollars please."
"Mr. Krabs"," Exactly!"
"Plankton"," You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?"
"Plankton"," Ten dollars, or the fight's off!"
"Plankton"," Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready."
"Plankton"," Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust. "
"Plankton"," Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's ""boring,"" or the food's ""inedible."" So sit down, enjoy the show, and buy some chum! "
"SpongeBob"," What do we do now Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. "
"SpongeBob"," NO!  Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh?  That's it Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck. "
"Plankton"," Chum on a stick. Get your chum.  What the?  Oh great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses?  Hey watch where you're...  Oh dear!  Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline!  NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!"
"SpongeBob"," My pleasure captain!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers."
"Mr. Krabs"," But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks for your business. "
"SpongeBob"," Sounds like Squidward ate at Mario's last night.  Good thing no one's around to notice his embarrassing...  Those construction workers! Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises.  I'll cover for him! Whoa!  Sorry fellas, this sure is a noisy trowel.  Look at this thing!  Ah, I really should get... "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you keep it down? I am trying to hone my musical talent here."
"SpongeBob"," You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?"
"Squidward"," And you guys!  Do you really think that billboard is more important than my musical genius?"
"Squidward","  Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?"
"Squidward"," Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer?  Thank you!  That would be nice. "
"Squidward"," Whoo-hooo! Yeah! Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," You've really made him happy."
"SpongeBob","  Okay..."
"Squidward"," Okay.  Get it together, Squidward. Put your game face on.  Heh, that's better.  Take your time with this one, Squidward, old boy.  Due tomorrow?!  Only one day to write my masterpiece! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together!"
"Squidward","  No!  Get out!  Patrick, what're you doing here?"
"Patrick"," Uhh... I don't know.  I'm funny. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure you don't want any help, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," No, thank you.  I am a solitary artist."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I think, I broke my bottom."
"SpongeBob","  Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa! "
"Patrick"," Yeah!  Ah. Much better."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor."
"Patrick"," I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance."
"SpongeBob"," What job is that?"
"Patrick"," Exactly."
"Squidward"," I'm a genius! "
"SpongeBob"," The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star.  Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm."
"Squidward"," Can't you two be quiet for one day? My composition is due tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! My patient is very sick!"
"Patrick"," Hey, I broke my butt."
"Squidward","  Become famous, revenge later. Hmm.  Come on! Be inspired!  Yes, brilliant! "
"Squidward"," Noooo!!!  Why? Why? Oh, why?  Dowrgghgh!  I did it!  Hahahahahaha! Yes!  I did it! I did it! I did it! And I did it! Ha ha ha ha!"
"Patrick","  Did what? "
"Squidward"," Here you go, maestro, my masterpiece."
"Squidward"," I wrote down everything I heard? "
"Squidward"," Patrick, get off of me! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward, they really liked you! Just don't get a ""swelled head"". "
"Squidward"," Ooh... What the  ...now?"
"SpongeBob"," La, la, la...  La-la-la, la, la-la-la..."
"Squidward","  Stop!  What could you possibly be trying to do this time?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning."
"Squidward"," By running around and screaming like a banshee?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this  Ahhhhhhh... "
"Squidward"," There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal.  And then there's you. "
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward"," Yes, really! Maybe you should start being a little more normal!  Doh..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not normal?  Squidward?  How does one become normal?"
"Squidward"," Well, how about you start by...  Getting away from me, you little creature!"
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal!  ""How to be Normal."" Hm, this video should help."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, yes, and yes."
"SpongeBob","  Normaaaality."
"SpongeBob","  Craters and freckles?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah..."
"Squidward"," Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.  What, no annoying blurbs today?  Hmm strangely quiet.  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Hi, how are ya."
"Squidward"," What's the meaning of this?"
"SpongeBob"," I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal. "
"Squidward"," Normal, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup."
"Squidward"," Oh, really?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup."
"Squidward"," Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid."
"SpongeBob"," Wonderful weather we're having."
"Squidward"," Uh, yes... it is."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, see ya 'round. "
"Squidward"," Yeah, I'll uh...see you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh?  Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more?  Oh, my! It's like printing money! "
"Squidward"," I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?!  Whose house is this?"
"SpongeBob","  Hi, how are ya."
"Squidward","  Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, how are ya."
"Squidward"," Good, just coming by to get a drink."
"SpongeBob"," Wonderful weather we're having."
"Squidward"," It sure is."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, see ya 'round."
"Squidward"," Yeah...  See ya.  Oh, my.  I could get used to this."
"Squidward"," There you are, sir.  Oh, yes it's time again. I've been meaning to say this but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately."
"SpongeBob"," You know it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Never?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. "
"SpongeBob"," Maybe this thing is out of ink."
"Mr. Krabs","  No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull."
"SpongeBob"," What you call dull I call normal."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!"
"SpongeBob","  I guess the decision to be normal was more life changing than I thought.  Hi, how are ya."
"Patrick"," What happened to you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I got normal."
"Patrick"," Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze? "
"SpongeBob"," Let's do something normal, like window shopping."
"Patrick"," Let's do this...  Ya-ha! Hey, your turn."
"SpongeBob"," I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?"
"Patrick"," Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun you know where to find me. "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, see ya 'round.  Hi, how are ya."
"Squidward"," I never thought I'd hear myself say this but please come in, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal."
"Squidward"," Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house."
"Squidward"," You know, SpongeBob, it's OK to be a little different. "
"SpongeBob"," And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go.  See? Looking normal already."
"Squidward"," What the...?"
"SpongeBob"," One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. "
"Squidward"," And stay out of my home! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus...  and clench.  Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. "
"Patrick","  Look at my tongue. "
"SpongeBob"," That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again."
"Patrick"," Huh, I don't think you have what it takes."
"SpongeBob"," Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again."
"Patrick"," It won't be easy but I'll do it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now."
"Patrick","  Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger.  Talk backwards."
"SpongeBob"," Tap erus uoy era? "
"Patrick"," It's happening. The final transformation. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal."
"Patrick"," No!!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't wanna be normal. "
"Patrick"," Go away."
"SpongeBob"," Normal is not worth it."
"Patrick"," We're in mourning. "
"Squidward","  It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob.  Hi, how are ya? "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life."
"Squidward"," Wonderful weather we're having, hm?"
"SpongeBob"," It sure is, buddy. It sure is. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine Squidward! You don't wanna be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? """" No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I cant replace everyone! I'll never be happy again!  Ooh, my driver's license!  That's the baby.  Hi, fella, it's me.  It's okay, i'm licensed.  Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la-  -la-la-la...  Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  NOOOOOOOOO!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry, I'm late Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. "
"SpongeBob"," Who, Boaty?  Oh no. He's... Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Patrick! Don't go!  Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed."
"SpongeBob","  Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sheesh. Calm down, boy."
"SpongeBob"," You're all still alive? Well where did you go?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It was National No SpongeBob Day."
"SpongeBob"," National No SpongeBob Day?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you."
"SpongeBob"," A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little."
"SpongeBob"," You too, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from... "
"SpongeBob","  I'm... glad you had fun. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course.  First we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground.  Whoo-hoo!! Burn, baby!  And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. "
"Patrick"," Big deal. Wait till you see ""No Patrick Day""? Come on, everyone. Lets go!  Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello? "
"SpongeBob","  7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, whoa! Open for business!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, whoo."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I suppose you can have the honor today, lad."
"Squidward","  37... 38... "
"SpongeBob"," Freshness, check. Buns, check.  Fresh patties.  Check.  Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail.  Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here?  Or is it just you?  Ah!  ""Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward."" Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up!  Whoa!  Hmm.  Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good.  Whoa!  I guess this is it.  Oh, you really saved me!  Whooooaaaa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go.  Oh, that kinda hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful!   Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache!  Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties."
"Squidward","  Looks like I'm crushing your face. "
"Squidward"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't move too much, it ruins it."
"SpongeBob","  Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous!  Perfection! "
"Squidward"," I hear you! I hear you!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Squidward"," Can I ask you something?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"Squidward","  What's that? "
"SpongeBob"," What's what?"
"Squidward"," You know. "
"SpongeBob"," Know what?"
"Squidward"," This."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," This thing here."
"SpongeBob"," What thing where?"
"Squidward"," The spatula  tied to your nose!"
"SpongeBob","  This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there  so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip  and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead but then I wasn't but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?"
"Squidward","  Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit. "
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Squiddy."
"Squidward","  Injury. Your brain is injured!  Wait a minute. Did you say that you got that splinter injury at work?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That's not good."
"SpongeBob"," I know, it hurts so bad."
"Squidward"," Yeah, when Mr. Krabs finds out, oh, man."
"SpongeBob"," Finds out what?"
"Squidward"," Finds out about this injury."
"SpongeBob"," You mean my splinter?"
"Squidward"," He'll be forced to send you home."
"SpongeBob"," H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!"
"Squidward"," Here, let me take this for you. "
"SpongeBob"," Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine!"
"Squidward"," It was a good shift while it lasted. "
"SpongeBob"," While it lasted? What are you doing?  W... What are you...?"
"Squidward"," I know it's hard to say goodbye."
"SpongeBob"," But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine!  I'm fine! I'm OK! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See?  See? See?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately,  the rules clearly state that you must be sent home."
"SpongeBob"," No, anything but that.  Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen!  You can't let them force me away!"
"Squidward"," Sorry, the rules are the rules.  Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here. "
"SpongeBob"," Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward"," What? Me? Tell Mr. Krabs? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No."
"SpongeBob"," Wew."
"Squidward"," Well, maybe."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," I don't have to tell Mr. Krabs.  Because he already knows. "
"Squidward","  Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things."
"Squidward"," Ahhhh... smell that fresh morning sea!  ♪La da dum dum dee.♪"
"Squidward"," Huh? Must be hearing things... Again!"
"Squidward","  What is that noise?!"
"Squidward"," Ahhhh.... I should have guessed. It's too early for this."
"Squidward"," Alright you two!  What is the meaning of this?!"
"SpongeBob"," What is the meaning of this?!  We're slide whistling!"
"Squidward"," Don't you mean, ""Playing the slide whistle?"""
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick."
"Squidward"," Hey! Get out of here! Huh? "
"Squidward"," Alright you two morons! Show yourselves!"
"SpongeBob"," You see Squidward! Slide whistling can add a little zest to the humdrum of everyday life."
"Squidward"," I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade! "
"Squidward"," Get out of there!"
"Squidward"," Grrrrr...  Just get out of there!  Okay, that's enough! You've had your fun."
"SpongeBob"," True Squidward, True. We have had our fun. But you know what's twice as much fun?!  Twice as many slide whistles! After you my good man. "
"Patrick"," Thanks buddy! "
"Squidward"," Not the windows again!  Gotcha! They're gone. Whew! Now if they'd just stay out of my house, I might be able to enjoy a little squid time."
"Squidward","  I gotta get out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Look Patrick! Squidward is finally playing along."
"Squidward"," Go away! Can't you idiots take a hint?! "
"Squidward"," I think I lost 'em. "
"Squidward"," How would you like it if someone did this to you?! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward! You have got quite an ear for music!"
"Squidward","  Don't you... I do?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes my friend. You got... the goods!"
"Squidward"," Well, uh...ha... that is true..."
"SpongeBob"," Come, play some more maestro. Me and Patrick want to sing to your saweeet tunes!"
"Squidward"," Well... If you insist..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! We insist!"
"Squidward"," Okay!"
"Squidward"," Watch this! "
"Squidward"," Goo goo wa wa goo goo wa goo goo he ha wa...  ha ha ha!"
"Squidward","  If you say so. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Patrick"," Probably not."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you think Squidward is taking this a little too far?"
"Patrick"," He's only a block away. "
"Squidward"," Would you like some more?! "
"Squidward"," Let's give them a grand finale they'll never forget!"
"Squidward"," Now you're in the driver's seat Squiddy! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, Plankton finally got what he deserved. Whoa! "
"Squidward","  I've never felt so alive!  I don't wanna stop!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, are you sure you don't wanna stop?"
"Squidward"," What are you talking about nitwit?!"
"SpongeBob"," Up ahead!!!"
"Squidward"," What up ahead?! "
"SpongeBob"," Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow Squidward, listen to you! You're getting better already! Here we'll help. "
"SpongeBob"," This is how to live, isn't it my friend?"
"Patrick"," You said it buddy."
"Patrick"," How do we do that?"
"Patrick"," But what's that have... "
"Patrick"," Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!"
"SpongeBob"," What's that Pat?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem our miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...LIVIN' LIKE LARRY!  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo! "
"Patrick"," Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, where you going?"
"Patrick"," To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know about this Patrick."
"Patrick"," You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it! "
"SpongeBob"," De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry. "
"Patrick"," Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, where are we going?"
"Patrick"," Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger... "
"Patrick"," Here's to living like Larry!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. ""Living like Larry"" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life."
"Patrick"," Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going."
"Patrick"," I see. And that's your final word on the subject?"
"SpongeBob"," Mmm-hmm."
"Patrick"," I feel sorry for you. "
"SpongeBob"," I wonder how Patrick's doing with his ""living like Larry"" thing."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?"
"Patrick"," Uh-uh."
"SpongeBob"," Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen."
"SpongeBob"," I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of ""living in the moment"" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? "
"SpongeBob"," By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? "
"SpongeBob"," So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry! "
"Patrick"," Are you sure about this SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?"
"Patrick"," I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! "
"SpongeBob"," Prepare for countdown!"
"SpongeBob"," 3-2-1 Lift off. "
"SpongeBob"," Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!! "
"Patrick"," Uh oh!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more.  What would Larry do?"
"SpongeBob"," I thought you left your swim suit at home."
"Patrick"," No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg! "
"SpongeBob"," Rotten eggs? "
"SpongeBob"," Who's Craig Mammalton?"
"Patrick"," His mother must be so proud."
"SpongeBob"," Wow Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is! "
"SpongeBob"," It seems to be stuck."
"SpongeBob"," Must be this tan to enter."
"SpongeBob"," Why thank you."
"Patrick"," We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today."
"SpongeBob"," In fact,  it's time for another coat. "
"Patrick"," We've gotta look our best."
"SpongeBob"," There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure. "
"Patrick"," Me first! Me first! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?"
"Patrick"," Like one of those hip young old folks from a soda commercial. "
"SpongeBob"," My turn!  Remember Patrick, 15 seconds exactly."
"Patrick"," Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working.  Okay Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," What? Did somebody say something? "
"Patrick"," What? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out. "
"Patrick"," Afraid so. Bye girls."
"SpongeBob","  Well Patrick, how do I look?"
"Patrick","  Oh, it's you. You don't look too good."
"SpongeBob"," What, what, what do you mean?"
"Patrick"," See for yourself. "
"SpongeBob"," I must have been under the tanning machine too long. "
"Patrick"," Ew, what are you gonna do?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do.  Hi Squidward."
"Squidward"," What is it now Sponge...  Ghost? I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm not a ghost Squidward.  I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long."
"Squidward","  Oh this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party.  Sun Bleached!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh, now I'll never get into that party."
"Patrick"," Hey, that's quitter talk Mr.! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover!  A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide.  What do you think?"
"SpongeBob","  I look... AMAZING. Time to go to the party!  Oh what a cute ""wittle"" baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo."
"Patrick"," Well, hey buddy, look like you could use an ice cream. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah, that hit the spot."
"Patrick","  One caramel sundae please. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go.  Patrick, why did you..."
"Patrick"," Can't talk, working."
"SpongeBob"," No, really Patrick, what are you...  Uh, I fell sticky."
"Patrick"," Take a look. "
"SpongeBob"," Wooh!  Thanks Patrick.  Uh, I'm stuck. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here.   Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Can I get a little help here?"
"Patrick"," Oh, sure thing pal. Hey everybody make some room! The floor's all yours. Knock 'em dead kid."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick I... "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing? "
"Patrick"," Whatever. I just gooooo with the flow."
"Squidward","  Squidward, my man, you are perfect!  Oh no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up, kelp grow. Hold still. "
"Patrick"," They're pretty."
"Squidward","  Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," And SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," What are you two doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden."
"Squidward"," STOP EATING MY KELP! "
"Patrick"," Okay, Okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out. I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead."
"Squidward"," Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Yeah."
"Squidward"," Then have some more!  Still want that ice cream?"
"Patrick"," Boy I do! Thanks Squidward. Want some SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam! "
"Squidward"," Are you done yet?"
"Patrick","  All done."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff. "
"Patrick"," Here you go SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you Patrick. You know my shoes feel kinda tight.  Huh, nice and roomy. "
"Patrick"," Do you want your grow juice back?"
"Squidward"," Oh no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it."
"Patrick"," Okay."
"Squidward"," Give me that!"
"Patrick"," But you said you didn't want it."
"Squidward"," Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?"
"SpongeBob"," That's a great idea Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I'll go first. "
"Squidward","  What did you do?"
"Patrick"," Quite an improvement, don't you think?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yes, I agree completely. Come on Patrick, let's do some good deeding!"
"Patrick"," Yay! "
"Squidward"," Hey, get back here,  and fix my nose! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped."
"SpongeBob"," There, now you have plenty of space. "
"Squidward"," Aha, they went this way."
"Squidward"," Oh, tell me about it. "
"SpongeBob","  There he is."
"Patrick"," Get ready."
"SpongeBob"," Now, Patrick!  There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make ""big money.""  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward."
"Patrick"," You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I got one! You know that thing?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, right, that thing that we did that day."
"Patrick"," No, the other one. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, you'd be ugly again."
"Squidward"," Yes, I'm sure!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, how to fix his nose?"
"Patrick"," What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's brilliant!!"
"Squidward"," No wait, don't. "
"SpongeBob"," That didn't work."
"Patrick"," Try it again."
"SpongeBob"," I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head."
"Patrick"," Well, now his body is too small."
"SpongeBob"," Right, too small. "
"Patrick"," Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!"
"Squidward","  I look horrible! "
"Squidward"," Well, pardon my anatomy!  What's happening?"
"Squidward"," What did you do to me?"
"Patrick"," I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!"
"SpongeBob"," And a giant."
"Squidward"," I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster!  What will I do now?"
"SpongeBob"," That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!"
"SpongeBob"," And we run around and scream like crazy! Try and catch us, giant monster Squidward. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, get back here!"
"SpongeBob","  This is really fun."
"Patrick","  I know. We should do this...  ...more often. "
"SpongeBob"," You are very good at pretending Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along. "
"Squidward"," What the?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all."
"Patrick"," Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face."
"SpongeBob"," Even though you really wanted to."
"Squidward"," OH, QUIET YOU MORONS!!!!!!!!!"
"Squidward"," Ow! "
"Squidward"," Okay, okay, I'm nice.  Now will you leave me alone?"
"Squidward","  Yeah, sure, whatever."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Squidward","  Uhh, I'm a lamp post?"
"Squidward"," Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Where are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. "
"Squidward"," What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him."
"Patrick"," So?"
"SpongeBob"," We shall do him another.  We did it! "
"Squidward"," What the?"
"SpongeBob"," Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. "
"Squidward"," A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?"
"SpongeBob"," We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet. "
"Squidward"," I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well at least my flowers survived the trip.  SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff!"
"SpongeBob"," What about Patrick, does he have to find his own flowers too? "
"Squidward"," What are you taking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!"
"Patrick"," Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my...  ...face?  You're right, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," My floors! Think fast, squiddy. I've got your nose."
"Patrick"," You do?"
"Squidward"," Yeah I've got it...  ...right here."
"Patrick"," Give me! Give it here!"
"Squidward"," If you want it, you gotta go get it. "
"Patrick"," There!  Well SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's not a nose that's a...  ...hermit crab."
"Patrick"," I guess I'll always be a noseless freak. "
"SpongeBob"," It's not so ab-normal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses."
"Patrick"," Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There ya are! "
"SpongeBob"," Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face."
"Patrick"," I can do that? "
"Patrick"," Sorry doc, but I don't really think it's me."
"Patrick"," Okay! Let's see. Hmm "
"SpongeBob"," All right Patrick, let's unveal the new shanauze! "
"Patrick"," Wait, stop, careful SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages. "
"SpongeBob"," There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy!  Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose."
"Patrick"," I will! Now, how do I use this thing?  What is that smell?  Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good! "
"Squidward"," Let's see Patrick destroy these. "
"Patrick"," All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!  What is that horrible smell?  Onion rings?  The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells!  What is it now?  I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing.  I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors.  Bad smells are all around me!  I cannot live in these conditions! "
"SpongeBob"," Hiya Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good."
"Patrick"," The smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable! "
"Squidward"," What's wrong with the pin head? "
"Patrick"," There's another one! No! I can't take it!"
"Squidward"," Where do you think you're going?"
"Patrick"," To do what should have been done long ago. , then screams] Sweet Neptune, imported cheese!  This is in-excusable!  Yuck!"
"Squidward"," What are you doing with my cheese?"
"Patrick"," It's rotten garbage now.  That's better."
"Squidward"," That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!"
"Patrick"," You are sick, Squidward!  There's that smell again! "
"SpongeBob"," 1, 2, 3, 4  Come on SquarePants, be a man! "
"Patrick"," You! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, help!"
"Patrick","  Oh, I'll help you all right! Help stop you polluting are world with your sweaty holes.  There."
"SpongeBob"," I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform."
"Patrick"," Well you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob.  Smell's like, something greasy!  Nobody move! I am ridding this place of it's disgusting stench, with these scented candles! "
"Patrick"," This air freshener should finish the job. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers! "
"Patrick"," Well good! No one should have to eat in this stench! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Why, I got a good mind to..."
"Patrick"," Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got plenty more stink holes to swab clean."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk! "
"Sandy"," Hiya Pat. "
"Patrick"," Take a bath, fleabag! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I've asked you all here, because we all face a similar problem. The problem, a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand.  Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it? "
"Squidward"," Let's give him what for."
"Sandy"," Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail. "
"SpongeBob","  Come on SpongeBob, be a man!  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public lishen! That no good, nose flartin..."
"SpongeBob"," It is not Patrick's fault!"
"SpongeBob"," It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!  Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom.  With a little raw sewage for good measure."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir! "
"Patrick"," Hello.  No!  All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you. "
"SpongeBob","  Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip.  Well this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it!"
"Squidward"," Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone!"
"Patrick"," I heard that! "
"SpongeBob"," You wanted to see me, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pull up a seat boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sit, down!  Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh yes sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient  to the secret formula! "
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and i'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Could you repeat that? "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's time!  Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!"
"SpongeBob"," I won't let you down."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," If something happens to that secret ingredient, don't bother coming back to work! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir!  And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty.  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe?  What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  What are you doing lolly gagging about? Get back to work!"
"SpongeBob","  Right away sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me."
"Patrick"," With what?"
"SpongeBob"," With this. "
"Patrick"," Here you go, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!"
"Patrick"," Find out!"
"SpongeBob"," You and I are going to need to do a little detective work! "
"Plankton"," What are we eating this time, Karen?"
"Plankton"," Oh, you mean the ""secret recipe"" I came up with?"
"SpongeBob"," Aha! I knew it was you!"
"Plankton"," What was me?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!"
"Plankton"," Is this a joke?"
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you tell me. Is it?!"
"Plankton"," Uh, no."
"Plankton"," What is going on here?! "
"Plankton"," Same as always, look! Empty again."
"Plankton"," I don't know anymore. "
"Plankton"," What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years! "
"Plankton"," Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?"
"Plankton","  What?!"
"Plankton"," You're kidding right?"
"Plankton"," Uh, okay if you insist.  Oh no, please don't sue me.  I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum. "
"Plankton","  Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!"
"Plankton"," Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more.  Now, I wait. I wait until he returns.  I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait."
"Plankton"," Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What?  Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true."
"Plankton"," Well hello, Nat."
"Plankton"," You certainly did, didn't you?"
"Plankton"," Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here."
"Plankton"," Is it okay?"
"Plankton"," You bet 'ya. "
"Plankton"," Oh, well, you know."
"Plankton"," What? You're coming back again?"
"Plankton"," Oh my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Rolling, rolling rolling. Money keeps on rolling.♪  One more time!  No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time, or any time! "
"Plankton"," Don't bother. There's no need."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you talking about?"
"Plankton","  I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now."
"Mr. Krabs","  You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!"
"Plankton"," But of course, loyal customer.  I'll see you later, loser. Much later! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food. You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you can count on me sir.  Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here.  Why settle for Plankton's lumpy Chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?"
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oath. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, fishpaste! "
"Plankton"," Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet Chum."
"Plankton"," Say, Nat, do you have any friends?"
"Plankton"," Would you hurry up with that Chum, Karen?!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop.  There's your Chum, bleep blap blop."
"Plankton"," And that doesn't look like Karen. "
"SpongeBob"," Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me."
"Plankton"," What have you done with Karen, you brute?! "
"SpongeBob"," So you're saying that you love Chum? And all that you ever eat is Chum?"
"SpongeBob"," Interesting. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Why go to the Chum Bucket, when the Krusty Krab is adding tasty Chum to our menu?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning Chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say?  You like it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what do you think?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What am I going to do? I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer!  I just can't afford it."
"SpongeBob"," I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's."
"Mr. Krabs"," But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum.  That's it boyo!  Where could it be?  There! Plankton's secret formula.  It's gotta be in here... "
"Plankton","  What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony."
"Plankton"," Ouch, double irony! "
"SpongeBob"," Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist.  I mean just think about that.  You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the... "
"Plankton"," Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation."
"Mr. Krabs"," Look at all that loot!"
"Plankton"," That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my Chum!"
"Mr. Krabs"," D'oh, just put me out of me misery! "
"Plankton"," Back for more of my delicious Chum, I see!"
"Plankton"," Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?"
"Plankton"," What's the deal, Karen?"
"Plankton"," All this time, I never had one regular customer?"
"Plankton"," Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?"
"Plankton"," What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me! "
"SpongeBob"," Quickly, now is the time to be a hasty retreat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed me self more! This irony is pretty good stuff. "
"SpongeBob"," 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Breathing."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace."
"SpongeBob","  Okay! "
"Squidward"," Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here."
"SpongeBob"," I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--"
"Squidward"," I don't care, what Mr. Krabs says! I just want. "
"SpongeBob"," Coffee rain!"
"Squidward"," It's hot chocolate. "
"SpongeBob"," Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait! "
"Squidward"," It's locked!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Huh? The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid..."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Oh, why can't I just find?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What?!"
"SpongeBob"," You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?"
"Squidward"," Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it."
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Squidward"," So I could get further away from you! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?"
"Squidward","  Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!"
"Squidward"," Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?  Boating school.  Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here."
"Squidward"," Um, excuse me, there don't seem to be any empty seats left."
"Squidward"," Do you mind?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can."
"Squidward"," We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I am here because I."
"Squidward"," Me?"
"Squidward"," Why I'm.  All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!"
"Squidward"," Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?"
"Squidward"," His side?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here. "
"SpongeBob"," Do you like it Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Shut it. "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? "
"Squidward"," I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? "
"Squidward"," Mm, bon appetite, Squidy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... "
"Squidward"," Eh, didn't see that coming. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, step on the gas?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!"
"SpongeBob"," I got it, I got it. "
"Squidward"," Just let go of it! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where'd Squidward go? "
"Squidward"," I was just leaving. "
"SpongeBob"," Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and."
"Squidward"," How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it."
"Squidward"," Thank you. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, please? This is important."
"SpongeBob"," You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me."
"Squidward"," No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before."
"SpongeBob"," Before what?"
"Squidward"," Before before."
"Squidward"," Before we were,  boating buddies."
"SpongeBob"," Yay!"
"Squidward"," Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?"
"Squidward"," Next week?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.  But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school! "
"SpongeBob"," Order up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," How's it looking out there, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs"," I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too.  Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?"
"SpongeBob"," Oooh, let me see there was... none."
"Mr. Krabs"," WHAT? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?"
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Fishboy Strikes Again?""  Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, they certainly are.  Please, allow me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25¢ PER WORD! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea! "
"SpongeBob"," What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?"
"Squidward"," Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new Krabby Kronicle! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! My very own press badge!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy? "
"SpongeBob"," On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look.  No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for!  Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm not taking a bus SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, this story is juicy! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yeah, I'm just breaking it in."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too."
"Squidward"," We haven't sold any papers today. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the Krabby Kronicle."
"Mr. Krabs"," Too boring?  SPONGEBOB!!!!!  What's the meaning of this?"
"SpongeBob"," Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Local Resident Watches Pole?"" No one's gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Imagination!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. Maybe instead of ""Man Watches Pole,"" you could say something like... oh... ""Man Marries Pole."" Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see?  Now that's a juicy story!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell! "
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase!"" I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story, possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way? "
"SpongeBob"," Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles.  Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady. "
"SpongeBob","  Very interesting... "
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Larry."
"SpongeBob"," Ruined? What are you talking about?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks for your business, and here's your paper. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!"
"SpongeBob"," That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, they're certainly doing me some good.  Can you believe it? Look at all this loot! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else.  Now get out there, and fetch another story! "
"Plankton"," Oh, Karen! I think this is it! The Chum Stick that's finally gonna drive Krabs out of business!"
"Plankton"," Why? I haven't done anything."
"Plankton","  ""Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?""  What?!?  Who's to blame for this? Who?!? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I... I know."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's wrong. boy? You sick or something?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't be silly, boy! We're a success!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you wouldn't!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, darn tootin' I would! Now get out there, and bring me a juicy one!"
"SpongeBob","  Aye-aye, sir. "
"Sandy","  Sorry, fellars, this is a private treedome."
"Sandy"," Oh, give me that!  ""Sandy Cheeks or Sandy Chump? Bushy tailed brainiac really a slow-witted squirrel, by... SpongeBob SquarePants?""  That yellow sidewinder thinks he can do that to me?!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You've really outdone yourself this time! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, that's a bunch of hooey!"
"SpongeBob"," I've seen people's lives ruined, with my own eyes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," People want wild juicy stories! That's what sells! Now I want your little yellow noggin, to come up with the wildest story ever! One that'll top all the others!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Surprise me! Give me a shocker!  Good night boy. I'll check on you tomorrow morning. And remember, the wildest story ever! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, the wildest story ever, huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," How's it going, lad? "
"SpongeBob"," Ahh-ahh, it's a surprise."
"Mr. Krabs"," Excellent! We're gonna sell out in no time! We'll have to do another printing.  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on?"
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Krabs Overworks Employees? Reaps Reward? Krabby Kronicle mastermind behind bogus stories pays his tired, under-age reporter pennies while he rakes in the dough?!?"""
"Sandy"," Not to mention the fact that he's written lies about us!"
"Plankton"," I lost my restaurant because of you! And I thought I was evil..."
"Mr. Krabs"," No! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, are you okay?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How can I be okay when me money's gone?! All gone!  It just goes to show, trying to make an easy buck doesn't pay.  Or does it?  Get me some scissors, boy-o! It's time to use my imagination!"
"Patrick","  Hey guys. Could you fix me and the wife up a couple of Krabby Patties? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend."
"Mr. Krabs","  You make Corn Crunch come out me nose!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt."
"Mr. Krabs"," I promise."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good night, sweetie. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hi, pumpkin. I was just setting out refreshments for your friends. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't say that. Here, would your friends want some pizza?"
"Mr. Krabs"," OK, you could have your allowance early. "
"Mr. Krabs"," See, you put it on the crackers  and a mamma mia you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, okay, I'm going. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Just putting up the house rules."
"Mr. Krabs"," And the most important one in all, no boys allowed!  Isn't it glorious?  Sweetie, you accidentally locked the door!"
"Mr. Krabs","  This is mutiny!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Open this door or I’ll..."
"SpongeBob"," You wanna stay here? At my house? With me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whaddya say, boy? "
"SpongeBob"," Yee-hee! Slumber party!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe I should just sleep under the highway. "
"SpongeBob"," We can stay up really, really late! And tell ghost stories! And trade socks! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Is that what girls do at slumber parties?"
"SpongeBob"," No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!"
"Mr. Krabs"," They what?!"
"SpongeBob"," You know how girls are."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?"
"SpongeBob","  Do I know any... no. But Gary does. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Look what they’re doing to that man’s house!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, it’s only a mov-ieeeeeeeeee........."
"Mr. Krabs"," Quiet, boy! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Turn it off! Turn it off, I can’t take it!"
"SpongeBob"," I don’t think this is the scary part yet."
"Mr. Krabs"," I…said…turn it off! "
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not zombies, you Barnacle Brain!  Teenagers."
"SpongeBob"," Zombie teenagers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They’re probably destroying me house right now! Like this!  Oops! I don’t care! It’s not mine!  Oh, look! One of the home owner’s most prized possessions!  La-di-da!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh look, this’ll be fun to destroy!  Whee!  Now do you get it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That’s what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then get into Pearl’s party and find out what they’re doing!"
"SpongeBob"," Leave it to me, Mr. K. I’ve got the perfect disguise. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who the heck is that?"
"SpongeBob"," I don’t know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about.  Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Huh? Huh? Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You are one-of-a-kind, boy. "
"SpongeBob","  Pizza delivery."
"SpongeBob"," Y-You didn’t?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, tell ‘em it’s from me!"
"SpongeBob"," Your dad sent it. It’s already paid for."
"SpongeBob"," Um.. uh...  Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," They’re on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," What’s taking SpongeBob so long? I’m getting tired of looking through his stuff. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hello?  Pizza! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I know, son. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs, that’s my eye! "
"Mr. Krabs"," And it’s ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less! "
"SpongeBob","  Piano repair man! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, it’s working! "
"SpongeBob","  Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy."
"Mr. Krabs"," You get into that party, or you’re fired!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," It’s me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Give me one good reason why I can’t stay!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeesh, I only asked for one."
"SpongeBob"," Really?!"
"SpongeBob"," So if I prove I’m fun, can I stay?"
"SpongeBob"," I only need eight! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Party!  Crank it up!"
"SpongeBob"," These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. "
"SpongeBob","  Party!"
"SpongeBob"," Fun! "
"SpongeBob","  Who wants to dance?"
"SpongeBob"," Let’s boogie! Whoo! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What in Neptune’s toupee is going on here?  Me knick-knacks!  Me root beer!  Me pile of old newspapers!  I was maybe gonna read that someday!  I knew I shouldn’t have trusted you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are.  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Cost me what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nooo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You’re welcome, sweetie!  Oh, this is so expensive!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think I know what’ll cheer you up.  A mug of ice cold root beer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob, that doesn’t cheer me up at all."
"SpongeBob"," Bikini Bottom pet show today! Good thing I put those notes there. Otherwise I could've forgotten. And I wouldn't wanna do that because the Bikini Bottom pet show is where you gotta go to see the best pets in town. Not that any other pet can take a chance against my buddy Gary. He's the bestest pet in the whole world. Love you, Gar-Gar.  Oh! The show starts in an hour! Hey, Gar, time to... Gary? Ow! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Ohhhh! Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward.  Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary, there you are. What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity.  Hi, Squidward.  Ready! Hi again, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Hello."
"SpongeBob"," Check. And last, but not least, a quick undercarriage check.  Whoa, okay, maybe we should skip that one. Let's see... Yep, that's about does it. A second, buddy. I'll carry your shell. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here."
"SpongeBob"," Luxurious mane?"
"SpongeBob"," I always use an old rope. I guess that's not good enough."
"SpongeBob"," Uh Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Pedicure? I didn't realize how much went into this."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by that guy!"
"Patrick"," What's up?"
"SpongeBob"," No, not you."
"Patrick"," Ok."
"SpongeBob"," Enough dilly-dallying! We got to get down to business!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy!  Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present. "
"SpongeBob"," And the piece de resistance glow-in-the-dark paint. Hey, where are you going? Gary, wait. We got to go back to the pet show!"
"SpongeBob"," Because we have got to show those other pets we are just as fancy as they are.  Oh, come on, Gary. Don't be this way. I'm doing it for you, not me."
"SpongeBob"," That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm so glad you just happened to show up. Help me.  Gary, stop it. I'm only doing this because I love you. Gary, look, it's him. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello! Sorry to bother you. Just wanted to get your opinion on my snail, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Gary. This is our time to shine!  Wow, Patrick. There's a whole lot of pet loving going on here today."
"Patrick"," Yeah. You and Gary don't have a chance."
"Patrick"," Now, what am I gonna do? I'm all alone behind this rope!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm right here."
"Patrick"," You don't understand, SpongeBob! You'll never understand what it's like to be alone behind the red rope! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Gary. He'll be back in time to see us win first place. Now let's go scope out the competition."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm Maybe you needs some shades, eh, Gare?  Silly boy, you're not supposed to eat the leash."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Boy these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose.  Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go."
"SpongeBob"," It's in the bag."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, no! Gary, you spit him out right now! I'm sorry. He usually only bites me."
"SpongeBob"," I speak a little bit, sir. I know what they're saying. They're saying Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched ! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these."
"SpongeBob"," You were trying to tell me that all along Weren't you, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I won't let it happen again."
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all."
"Patrick"," Woof, woof! "
"Squidward","  If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu."
"SpongeBob"," It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Were you talking to me, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs. The f-f..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that."
"SpongeBob"," The fan... it..."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're not wearing shoes, lad. You're not going Section 8 on me, are ya?"
"SpongeBob"," I was wearing shoes. They... It's so hot they melted off."
"Mr. Krabs"," Melted off?"
"Squidward"," The fan stopped working."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you didn't... forget... to pay the power bill again, did you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course not! Here. Just fan yourself with some of this junk mail I keep finding in me mail box. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," That reminds me. Where are all me customers?"
"Squidward"," Probably out enjoying this beautiful day where it was meant to be enjoyed."
"Mr. Krabs"," Could you be a little more specific?"
"Squidward"," They're at the beach."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys, I forgot to tell ya! Close up shop. We're going to the beach today!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," My name is Eugene Krabs and I would like to know if I could interest either one of you in a fresh, delicious..."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabby Patty, fresh off the grill!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes! Today, they're only three dollars! Each."
"Squidward"," I told you!"
"Sandy"," Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Sandy"," -eeeeeeeeeeeeeee-"
"Sandy"," -eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-haw! I love the beach!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that noise was Sandy."
"Sandy"," Y'all be careful! Looks like some big waves a-comin'!"
"Squidward"," Who are you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Either you buy a Patty, or get off me wave!"
"Sandy"," Cowabunga!"
"Squidward"," What next?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Aloha, Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, there, young feller! How'd you like to be our first customer in over seventeen working days?"
"Patrick"," I'd love to!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, show him the menu."
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Uh, I can't quite see it from here. I'll just have to climb on board."
"SpongeBob"," Ha, ha, ha!! That's a good one Patrick on-board! Whoa!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Careful! You're gonna capsize us!"
"Patrick"," Almost up! "
"Squidward"," You idiot!"
"Patrick","  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eeeeeeee!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Look out!"
"Sandy","  Locals only!"
"Patrick"," What'd she say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!  Aaaaahhhhhh!"
"Sandy"," Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm.  Dark sky.  Water spouts.... of blood.  Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?"
"SpongeBob"," Just dragging it around."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Island?"
"Squidward"," Island?"
"SpongeBob"," We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?"
"Patrick","  Om."
"SpongeBob"," How did you guys get here?"
"SpongeBob"," Why do they call you Twitch?"
"SpongeBob"," Never mind."
"SpongeBob"," So what did you say this house is made from again?"
"Squidward"," Great."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon."
"SpongeBob","  O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom? AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SURF!!! "
"SpongeBob","  Cool!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?"
"Patrick"," You bet!"
"SpongeBob"," Down here!  See? It's a picture of Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Wow."
"SpongeBob"," What's he saying?"
"SpongeBob"," Who?"
"Patrick"," Will there be nachos there? "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch."
"SpongeBob"," How far up stream did you say it was?"
"Sandy"," Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!!"
"SpongeBob"," Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe."
"Squidward"," Again?!"
"SpongeBob","  Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys!! I found the Cove!! "
"Squidward"," I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here."
"Squidward"," You've never even seen him!"
"SpongeBob"," You've got to stop judging people by the way they look. "
"Squidward","  You're right."
"Patrick","  Look!"
"SpongeBob"," It's him!"
"Squidward","  Oh, my j- "
"SpongeBob"," It's JKL! Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee."
"Patrick"," Plus, we wanna talk to you."
"SpongeBob"," Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home? "
"Patrick"," Uh..."
"Squidward"," Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?"
"Patrick"," I kinda like staring at him."
"SpongeBob"," I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake."
"Squidward"," What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Locust. Culinary! Oh.  Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, there ain't no use crying over it.  Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is..."
"Squidward","  Oh, wonderful."
"SpongeBob"," Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson."
"Squidward"," That's it?! I just wanna go home! "
"SpongeBob"," Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?"
"Squidward"," Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup."
"Squidward"," And?"
"SpongeBob"," He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed."
"Squidward"," We're gonna be stuck here forever!!"
"Sandy"," Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back.  Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!"
"Squidward"," Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night."
"Squidward"," All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna..."
"SpongeBob"," Where's he going?! Come on! "
"SpongeBob","  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"
"Patrick"," Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!"
"SpongeBob"," JKL! Is this the next part of our training?"
"Patrick"," Increased chance of precipitation? "
"SpongeBob"," A perfect wave?"
"Patrick"," Hey, that's what they used to call me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How do you know?"
"Mr. Krabs","  No!! "
"Sandy"," This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful!  May Day! May Day! I'm goin' down!! Repeat Down!!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... where is that, exactly? "
"Sandy","  May Day!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, all alone again.  Cashy!"
"SpongeBob"," JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf."
"Squidward"," Here it comes!!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye."
"Squidward"," I volunteer SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Keep paddling, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!"
"SpongeBob"," It's... the Big One!!!!"
"Patrick"," No!!"
"Patrick"," Hey, I was gonna eat that!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, grab on!"
"Squidward"," Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! "
"SpongeBob"," Hang on, Squidward! This is it!"
"Patrick"," Time for those lessons to pay off!"
"Squidward"," Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who said that? "
"SpongeBob"," MR. KRABS!!! I never even got a chance to tell him that I..."
"SpongeBob"," JKL! And Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And Cashy!  CASHY!!"
"SpongeBob"," JKL!"
"SpongeBob"," No!!!!"
"Squidward"," I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal."
"Patrick"," Now what are we gonna do?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy","  I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend."
"Sandy"," Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick."
"Sandy"," My friends. They went surfing and never returned."
"Sandy"," You some kinda mind-reader?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Twitch!!"
"Patrick"," I love this song!"
"Squidward"," Look!"
"SpongeBob"," JKL!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Cashy!"
"SpongeBob"," Turn it up, Chip! "
"SpongeBob","  Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll  deep  in Jellyfish Fields.  I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from?  Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays."
"Patrick"," Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasn't me."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek."
"Patrick"," So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it."
"SpongeBob","  So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really..."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it...it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub!"
"SpongeBob"," The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with..."
"SpongeBob"," W-W-What are we gonna do?"
"Patrick"," Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home, eating a box of Kelp Jerky."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?"
"Patrick"," I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this clam is choking! Luckily, I come prepared!  There, there, Clammy. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," They like this!"
"Patrick"," No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesn’t work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before.  Like this! Ready, clam?"
"Patrick"," Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what about the clam?"
"Patrick"," What clam? I've never seen that clam before in my life."
"SpongeBob"," But if..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the clam had a baby!"
"Patrick"," That's not a baby, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, what could it be?"
"Patrick"," I'll give you a hint what's white, round, and comes out of clams?"
"SpongeBob"," Their...eyes?"
"Patrick"," No, silly! A volleyball!"
"SpongeBob"," A baby volleyball!"
"SpongeBob"," Good idea coming here, Patrick."
"Patrick"," That's my specialty."
"SpongeBob"," Having good ideas?"
"Patrick"," No, being called Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should do some stretches, first."
"Patrick"," Good idea!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's my specialty."
"Patrick"," Having good ideas?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope, doing some stretches, first."
"SpongeBob"," 138, 139,"
"SpongeBob"," Hello."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, really?"
"SpongeBob"," We don’t mind, do we Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Well, just don’t take too long. We were just about to start playing with it."
"SpongeBob"," We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields."
"SpongeBob"," Choking a clam."
"Patrick"," What do you mean, ‘small fortune?’"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Huh? Oh, I don’t know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. I’ll catch up with you later, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that looked like the last of them."
"Patrick"," The last of what?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," So, did you figure out what you’re gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup…I mean, nope."
"Patrick"," Well, my dad always told me when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, your dad really told you that?"
"Patrick"," Well, what he said was, ‘How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there?’ But I knew what he meant."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don’t know what to buy."
"Patrick"," You do?"
"SpongeBob"," The mall!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, where’d you go?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, there you are."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!"
"Patrick"," You can say that again!"
"SpongeBob"," Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea!"
"Patrick"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Let’s go shopping again! And this time, buy stuff!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wasn’t that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we could’ve bought anything in the whole world!"
"Patrick"," Yup!"
"SpongeBob"," So tell me, what’d you buy?"
"Patrick"," A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, me, too! And to think we barely even put a dent in my fortune!"
"SpongeBob"," Two, please one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks.  There you go."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that’s okay. I kinda have more money than I know what to do with right now."
"SpongeBob"," Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help.  Here you go."
"SpongeBob"," That’s okay, I already got my ice cream. See?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing. Do you need some, too, Bert?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?"
"SpongeBob"," It’s a deal!"
"Patrick"," Ice cream?"
"Patrick"," Uh…I’m here to see SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Well, I don’t think so. Normally, I…"
"Patrick"," Good day. Uh, your shoe’s untied."
"Patrick"," Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," And I said, go ahead, let’s do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," That’s my name, don’t wear it out."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know your house is full of strangers!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, these aren’t strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right everybody?  That right!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you hear that? That is the sound of love."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you won’t have any left to…"
"Mr. Krabs"," Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Like I was saying…"
"Patrick"," But…"
"Mr. Krabs"," We don’t want any trouble, now just keep moving."
"SpongeBob"," And I told him, it’s not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is…"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Won’t happen again."
"SpongeBob"," No matter, he’s simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle."
"Mr. Krabs"," Say, that reminds me…can I have some money?"
"SpongeBob"," Why certainly. I always remember to…  Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket.  Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?"
"SpongeBob"," Noooooooooo!  Well, everyone, I hope this doesn’t put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it’s just that all my money is…  …gone."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don’t be late for work tomorrow, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, hey SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha doing?"
"Patrick"," Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I was wrong."
"Patrick"," About what?"
"SpongeBob"," The money, and about those people being my friends."
"Patrick"," There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either ‘is’ or there ‘isn’t.’"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that you’re my best friend, then I don’t want anymore money, ever again."
"Patrick"," Well, why didn’t you say so, buddy? I’ve been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!"
"SpongeBob"," You got another new volleyball?"
"Patrick"," Yup, I found it!"
"SpongeBob"," Found it? Where?"
"Patrick"," Inside the Bikini Bottom Diamond Mine!"

"Patrick"," Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand."
"SpongeBob"," Really? Me, too. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. Heh heh. Now what?"
"SpongeBob","  That tickles. "
"Patrick"," Good catch! "
"SpongeBob"," Look, I'm a..."
"Patrick"," Helicopter."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing out there?!"
"SpongeBob"," Fake wrestling."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun. Doesn't that make us winners?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Actually...  It doesn't!  Okay, okay, look. Just...  Hey, where'd they...  Oh, no! Not the..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, Mr. Fluffy."
"Mr. Krabs"," End it?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get up! Get up, you guys!"
"Mr. Krabs","  C'mon, c'mon, wake up! "
"Patrick","  1 and 2 and squeeze."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, who am I kidding? Goodbye, money. "
"Patrick"," Squeeze."
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodbye, money. "
"Patrick"," Squeeze."
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hello, money!  Woo-hoo! Money, sweet money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Curtain Number 2?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Like we're really gonna turn all this money for..."
"SpongeBob"," See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?"
"SpongeBob"," The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing. "
"SpongeBob"," I know, I know. It's so embarrassing.  I wanted the one with the kittens on it."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do."
"SpongeBob","  This one... smells funny."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!"
"Patrick"," One, two, three, four..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?"
"Patrick"," No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three..."
"SpongeBob"," One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please."
"SpongeBob"," All right!"
"SpongeBob","  Here you are, my good sir."
"Patrick"," Seventeen..."
"SpongeBob"," So... shiny... and smooth!  Ah... oh! Oh!  Oooh! Mermaid Man's bubble-powered wheelchair from season twelve! And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever."
"SpongeBob"," How much is it? For this one?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I have a good feeling about this one. Oh, come on. And it's... not there.  Mmm... no.  Ohhh! I'll never find card fifty-four!"
"Patrick"," Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's just another..."
"SpongeBob"," Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!"
"Patrick"," It sure does the job, all right. "
"SpongeBob"," Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it!"
"Patrick"," I'm preventing gingivitis. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And  Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?"
"Patrick"," Yes, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack.  Whew! Now watch where you're going!"
"Patrick"," Okay. Thanks, buddy."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, look out!  Ha, that was close."
"Patrick"," Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been..."
"Patrick"," What? "
"SpongeBob"," The card!   Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes. "
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh!  Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card."
"Patrick"," Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys.  Nope.  There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere."
"SpongeBob"," The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up!  Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!"
"Patrick"," Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat.  You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean...  you'd give me your most valuable possession?"
"Patrick"," I'd give you my most valuable possession? "
"SpongeBob"," You're the best pal ever."
"Patrick"," I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, pal. Anything for you."
"Patrick"," Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, sure Patrick."
"Patrick"," Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, wait! Let me call a locksmith."
"Patrick"," Oh! I don't need any old locksmith. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't..."
"Patrick"," Ugh!  Man, this card is fantastic!  Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card.  Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it."
"SpongeBob"," No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!"
"Patrick"," Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest.  There! Nice and shiny! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! The card! It's on fire!"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it. There! Good as new!"
"SpongeBob","  Ew."
"Patrick","  Dinner is served. "
"Patrick","  Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot!  Hey! Look at that!  Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! It's ruined! "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, what's wrong?"
"SpongeBob","  Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!"
"Patrick","  Aw... sure you will."
"SpongeBob"," No. No! I spent all my money! And,  and,  and, you bought that last pack! So there's no more left in all of Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick"," Well, how about these? "
"SpongeBob","  Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!"
"Patrick"," Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em."
"SpongeBob","  May I... have one?"
"Patrick"," They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow."
"SpongeBob","  Wow!"
"Patrick"," Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards?  I locked myself out of my house again. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, that's over with, Now why don't you go see if First Mate Squidward needs any help at the register?"
"SpongeBob"," And what are you up to on this fine, fine Monday?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I was gonna wait til this afternoon, but I guess I could show you now."
"SpongeBob"," Show me what?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah! You are?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I sure am. "
"SpongeBob"," Who are ya gonna introduce it to?"
"Squidward"," Ha!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Anyway, we got new beverage cups."
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Mr. Krabs","  There's Regular, Large, and the new Viking Size!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, these are all the same size cup."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, this promotion is designed to save US money. Now, don't forget. Each participating patron who purchases any drink in our new Krusty Krab Viking Size cup gets to a chance to try on this genuine cardboard Viking helmet. "
"Squidward"," That he found while cleaning out his attic over the weekend."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you know when you're being ignored?"
"Squidward"," You're the only one talking."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs...  it's beautifu-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not so fast! Access to the mighty helmet will be granted to active promotion participants only. And only those who purchase Viking Size."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago."
"SpongeBob"," How long?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I, uh, about ten years."
"SpongeBob"," And?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh.....  You're gonna have to ask Squidward any more questions ya got. He's the smart one. "
"Squidward"," Barnacle butt."
"SpongeBob","  Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Ay! What do you want?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings."
"Squidward"," Oh really?"
"SpongeBob"," Will ya teach me, huh?!"
"Squidward"," Sure! I'll teach ya. Listen closely now. The Vikings were...."
"Squidward"," a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born."
"Squidward"," They are believed to have discovered ketchup...."
"Squidward"," and enjoyed dressing up their pets as...."
"Squidward"," scrambled masonry on the weekends."
"Squidward"," Their favorite movies are in black and white."
"Squidward"," And grown Vikings are known to collect socks which they display and trade at monthly sock trading conventions called Sock'n Garten."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa...."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size?"
"Squidward","  Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you think that-"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Can't you see I am trying to work?"
"SpongeBob"," But-"
"Squidward","  But what?!"
"SpongeBob"," There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out."
"Squidward","  Well, then why don't you go ASK THEM?!"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff.  If you would take the time to  answer all my neat questions,  then that would be  really swell."
"Squidward","  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, there's some Vikings here to see you."
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Squidward? I couldn't here ya. I was.... ooh."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I think so."
"SpongeBob"," Huzzah!"
"SpongeBob"," How interesting."
"SpongeBob"," What a fascinating culture."
"Squidward"," What the?! Hey! You can't do  thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!!"
"SpongeBob","  I can't believe how much I'm learning."
"Squidward"," Would you mind telling us what this is all about?"
"Squidward"," So, let me guess. Your name must be...."
"SpongeBob"," Nice to meet ya."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I still have lots more questions about the Vikings' way of life."
"SpongeBob"," Well, like... what do the Vikings like to do for fun?"
"SpongeBob"," Anything else?"
"SpongeBob"," Anything else?"
"SpongeBob","  I'll let you know if I think of anything."
"SpongeBob"," Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula."
"Squidward"," Ha."
"Squidward"," Well, if you must know, I'm a widely renowned clarinet virtuoso, state-recognized interior design consultant, licensed and board certified antique macrame conosuor, born and raised collector and sculptor of driftwood, and able to recognize over 13 hundred brand names of single-personed pedal operate vehicles at a single glance. Plus, I make a killer Soufflé."
"SpongeBob"," A Promotion. Congratulations, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place! Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get?! Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto!  On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait!  You can't do that."
"SpongeBob"," If it means saving my best friend, then yes."
"SpongeBob"," But.... "
"SpongeBob"," But, but I..."
"SpongeBob"," Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up."
"SpongeBob"," What's that for?"
"SpongeBob"," But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that?"
"Squidward","  What the barnacles is going on down there?"
"SpongeBob"," Pardon me, Squidward! "
"Squidward","  It's all yours."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks.  There."
"SpongeBob"," Here goes nothing! "
"SpongeBob"," Now that's what I call a Viking-sized adventure!"
"Patrick"," Oh, boy! We're gonna get our books signed and then we're gonna meet Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and then we're gonna shake their hands and then they're gonna sign our books!"
"SpongeBob"," There's only one problem! ...I can't."
"Patrick"," What do you mean? "
"SpongeBob"," I'll be in boating school at 8 a.m. tomorrow."
"Patrick"," Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always works for Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? No, I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong."
"Patrick"," Okay. Hmm... oh, I know! What are those things you use when... after you eat, you need to take a..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Take a... take a bathroom break!"
"Patrick"," That's the one! Why don't you take a bathroom break tomorrow, sneak out the window, get your book signed, and sneak back into class! It wouldn't take long at all!"
"SpongeBob"," But what if I don't need to use the bathroom?"
"Patrick"," Oh! There's always the catch.  I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is this really neces—"
"Patrick"," —sary? Yes, it is! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," You feeling all right?"
"Patrick","  Uh-huh.  Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing. Nothing.  That's it!"
"Patrick"," What? "
"SpongeBob"," I won't go to the bathroom till tomorrow. And when I have to go, I'll really have to...  ...go. "
"SpongeBob"," Nneee just a little... woo! Woo! I gotta, nnnnn, gotta go to the..."
"SpongeBob"," The bathroom key!"
"SpongeBob"," Nnnnn, thank you, Mrs. Puff. Nnnnn... "
"SpongeBob","  Thanks. Will do. Nnnnn... "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, will you sign our books?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that was fun. Well, I should really start heading back to class."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, look!  Let's go catch it! "
"SpongeBob"," But what about my class?"
"Patrick"," This is a shortcut."
"SpongeBob"," Wait up! You don't even have a net! Patrick!  Wow. Neptune's scepter, I don't believe this!"
"Patrick"," Pretty cool, huh? "
"SpongeBob"," How'd you do that?"
"Patrick"," I didn't do it. They did.  They're friendly."
"SpongeBob"," Wow!  Oh boy, you weren't kidding! "
"SpongeBob","  You're free to go, guys. "
"Patrick","  Ice cream! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on, I don't have time for this."
"Patrick"," Yeah, four scoops. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, have you forgotten I gotta go?"
"Patrick"," Oh, don't be such a sourpuss.  Here, I'll buy you a cone."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Well, this certainly has been a glorious day, but I better get back to class."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you said it buddy."
"Sandy"," Where do you think you're going, SquarePants? You just got here."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Sandy, but I just gotta get back to class."
"Sandy"," Sure you can't stay for just a short spell, SpongeBob? I mean, it's such a nice day, everyone's having a good time."
"SpongeBob"," No! I gave Mrs. Puff my word, and I shall not betray her!"
"Sandy"," Not even for a game of badminton with me and Dale here?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, maybe just one game."
"Sandy"," I'm serving it up, SpongeBob! Ready or not! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you know how to play this game?"
"Patrick"," "
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," Is this the one when the lowest score wins? "
"Sandy"," Nice job, SpongeBob! Your serve!"
"SpongeBob"," Here it comes! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game!"
"Patrick"," "
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Well, I better be off now."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if it's for the fans, well maybe I can play one game more."
"SpongeBob"," C-c-c-c...  ...criminal!?  I gotta go back to class!  I can't be a ditcher!  Almost there. Just have to get past the...  ...Bikini Bottom Hug Fest?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no..."
"SpongeBob"," Miss, if you don't let me go right now, I might have to turn into a criminal!  Whaaa!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!  The tar pits?  Ah! I'm sinking!  Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, ""Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!"" Goodbye, world. Goodbye, Mrs. Puff. I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Ohh! I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free.  Mrs. Puff. I'm really sorry. Please forgive me. I don't know what happened. Everything just got away from me.  I brought back your bathroom key, though."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Mrs. Puff. I'll never ditch again! I promise."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin bla, bla, bla!"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, ""The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws."" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too."
"Mr. Krabs"," So I bought me a ship, hired a crew....."
"Mr. Krabs"," And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound."
"Mr. Krabs"," I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad."
"Mr. Krabs"," For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew."
"SpongeBob"," We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate."
"SpongeBob"," Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!"
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," "

"Mr. Krabs"," He's comin'!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hide me, boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?"
"SpongeBob"," Um..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast."
"Mr. Krabs"," Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it."
"Mr. Krabs"," I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, ""Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"""
"SpongeBob"," Oh!! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, aparrently me cabin is haunted as well."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not to worry, Granddad. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, nothing. Look! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Clear!"
"Patrick"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," Woo-hoo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sounds like we got a prize.  Ready, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad. Check the... Granddad?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, so depulsive."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go get it, Granddad."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel? "
"Mr. Krabs","  That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nooooo! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I can explain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry! I have it under control! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Oh, never mind that!  Just go home. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I bet you're wondering about that."
"Patrick"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Do you mind?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just a second. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation."
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course I do, Granddad."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!  And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie!  This crew is a lie!  Even the ship is a lie!  All of it! All a lie!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really? Thanks, Granddad!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I knew I got me talent from someone! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward?  Squidward, are you okay?"
"Squidward"," Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you talking about?"
"SpongeBob"," It's Squidward!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?"
"Squidward"," Roger! Is that you?"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!"
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Hello, Brother Roger."
"Squidward"," Thank you."
"Squidward"," Ah. This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for."
"Squidward"," I'll never forget my initiation ceremony."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Way to go!"
"Patrick"," Way to go!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Patrick! Did you follow me here?"
"Squidward"," But...but, I..I...I...."
"Squidward"," I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge."
"SpongeBob"," Do we get to join the lodge?"
"Squidward"," Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh! How did you know?"
"Squidward"," Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe he got to join the lodge!"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?"
"Patrick"," Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where's Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Hold on. "
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Found Squidward. "
"Squidward"," The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too."
"Patrick"," Well, at least you still have the hat."
"Squidward"," Yeah.  I do, don't I?"
"SpongeBob"," You still have your robes."
"Patrick"," You still have your underwear."
"Squidward"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward","  You can look now."
"SpongeBob"," Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in."
"SpongeBob"," We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Not his fault."
"Patrick"," Was it my fault?"
"SpongeBob"," No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either."
"Patrick"," Uh...maybe it's your fault."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!"
"SpongeBob"," No. You can't set foot in the lodge."
"Patrick"," Ever!"
"Squidward"," Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"
"Squidward"," No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?"
"SpongeBob"," That's it!  Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Dog-pile on Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Aaahhhh! ."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?"
"Squidward"," Say good-bye. "
"Squidward"," Morons."
"SpongeBob","  So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation."
"Patrick","  Hey."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake."
"Patrick"," Secret!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!"
"SpongeBob"," Not the way we do it."
"Patrick"," We don't use our pinkies."
"Squidward","  Out!"
"Patrick"," I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push. "
"Squidward"," Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks."
"SpongeBob","  Let's move. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, we can let him out now."
"Squidward"," Are you insane? You kidnapped me?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for..."
"Patrick"," Initiation."
"Squidward"," What? What kind of initiation?"
"SpongeBob"," A very special initiation. "
"Squidward"," Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?"
"Patrick"," After you, Brother SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow!  Brother Patrick."
"Patrick"," Brother SpongeBob.  Aaahhhh!  Brother Squidward. "
"Squidward","  Eee-aahhhhhhh!"
"Squidward"," What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on!  Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!"
"SpongeBob"," They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends."
"Squidward"," Feather Friends?"
"SpongeBob"," Somebody already had Feather Buddies."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley."
"Squidward"," Grrrr.  I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?"
"Squidward"," Grrr...no."
"SpongeBob"," Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it.  Everything we need is in this drawer. "
"Squidward"," A sock?"
"SpongeBob"," Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!"
"Patrick"," Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan."
"Squidward"," One flaw?"
"Patrick"," That sock is way too small."
"SpongeBob"," It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery. "
"Patrick"," That's what I'm talkin' about!"
"Squidward"," Huh."
"Squidward","  This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!"
"Patrick"," Roooo!"
"SpongeBob"," Roar!"
"Patrick"," Roo!"
"SpongeBob"," Roar!"
"Squidward"," Unbelievable."
"Squidward","  Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee. "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Way to go, Squidward."
"Patrick"," It works!"
"Squidward"," Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends."
"Patrick"," But you'll have to pass the initiation again."
"Squidward"," Aaah! No!"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Bleh!"
"Squidward","  May I help you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? ."
"Squidward"," Nope. ."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward.  Pretty incredible shift, huh?"
"Squidward","  If you say so."
"SpongeBob"," Any plans after work?"
"Squidward","  No."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood.   Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there.  So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward? ."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you.  Ever!  Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. ."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! It's been so long! I can't even remember your last visit! "
"Squidward"," That's probably because I've never visited you."
"SpongeBob","  Please? Please? Please?!  Please?! Please?!  Please?  Please?  Please? Please? Please?  Please, please? Pleeeaase? Pleaaaaaase? Please? Please? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any... "
"Squidward"," Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this Why would I leave the comfort of my home for your dirty little hovel? "
"SpongeBob"," What if I got a couple of throw pillows?"
"SpongeBob"," . Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home? "
"Patrick"," Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed. "
"SpongeBob"," He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my ""dirty little hovel""."
"Patrick","  Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back.  Uhh!  Well... hey, thanks for lettin' me play puzzle with you. See ya later! "
"SpongeBob"," That's it!"
"Squidward","  A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper...  Dya—ah!  Not on the rug!  SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement."
"Squidward"," Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh-okay, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  I need the right tool for the job. Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ... Oh, P.S. "
"SpongeBob"," SquarePants residence. "
"Squidward"," Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!  It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor! "
"Squidward","  That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it."
"Squidward"," Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?"
"SpongeBob","  You won't even recognize the place, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Yeah, probably not.  I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit! "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can... "
"Squidward"," I just want my vacuum back...  You've made an exact replica of my living room! "
"SpongeBob","  Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of my home,  so I brought the comfort here!  Isn't it great?! "
"Squidward","  No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and...  Never mind. Just give me my vacuum. "
"SpongeBob"," Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea? "
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Hot hors d'oeuvres? "
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Nachos? "
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Blancmange?"
"Squidward"," I-I don't even know that that is!  Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, of course.  Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum.  Please make yourself at home!  Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum.  And stop fluffing this pillow!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything. "
"Squidward"," Imbecile.  How did he do it?  He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book.  And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! ""For Squiddy, with love, Mama."" "
"SpongeBob"," You yelled?"
"Squidward","  Never mind! I'll find the vacuum myself! "
"SpongeBob"," Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit."
"Squidward","  My hallway...  Dear Neptune!  He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in!  Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home.  Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom.  I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct.  How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet?  My rash cream?  That little sneak! '"
"SpongeBob"," Did someone say ""rash cream?"" "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, you idiot!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, the rash cream.  Oops.  Oh, no!  I don't think I have a cream for that."
"Squidward","  Oh, what a horrible nightmare. "
"SpongeBob"," So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?' "
"Squidward"," Uh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again. "
"SpongeBob"," Tsk.  Hurry back, Squidward! "
"Squidward","  I’ve gotta find that vacuum and get out of here! "
"Squidward","  He copied all 492 of my self-portraits...  ...and they're better than mine!  He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything.  This...all of this is just...  Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...  posthaste!  A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home...  Home... with me... with me... "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob!  Is it really you?  It is you!  Come on, baby. We are gonna walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it with dignity and pride.  My house..."
"Patrick"," You just missed the fire. "
"Squidward"," What happened to my house? "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed. "
"Squidward"," Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner.  Care for some casserole?? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? You okay? Squidward?  Squidward! "
"Squidward","  Ah... Replica, sweet replica."
"SpongeBob"," It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary? "
"SpongeBob"," It's laundry day, Gary!  Oops. "
"SpongeBob","  Now to finish the day's chores.  Hello?"
"Patrick"," Hello. Uh, may I speak with SpongeBob, uh, uh...  ...Squaaa...re...Paaaaants?"
"SpongeBob"," Mm, speaking."
"Patrick"," Hey, hey. You want to hear how long I can do this for? "
"SpongeBob"," Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait?"
"Patrick","  No. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer."
"Patrick"," A pretty long time. Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick.  Gary?  They've shrunk!  I'm gonna need to get new pants. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh.  No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh.  Whoa, these pants hug my body better than my own mother!  Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose."
"Patrick"," Do I know you?"
"SpongeBob","  It's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?  No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me."
"Sandy"," Well, howdy, stranger! I don't recognize you in those newfangled dungarees.  You must be SpongeBob FancyPants. Clothes really do make the man!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head.  But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together. "
"Squidward"," Oh, no. It's that little yellow freak."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Just ignore him. Maybe he'll go away."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward! Guess who?"
"Squidward"," Do I know you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants."
"Squidward"," Never seen you before in my life."
"SpongeBob"," Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory.  Me and you at my birthday party.  Me and you at work.  That little slumber party we had last week.  I forgot when this was taken."
"Squidward"," Is that supposed to be you?  I can't believe. He actually left. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right.  Oh no, it's locked.  Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants. "
"Patrick"," Hello. Can I help you?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Oh, right. You're that round pants fellow."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing in my house?"
"Patrick"," Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us.  I wish I could see him one last time. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again.  Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq...  Sorry, I'm a little...  I'm a little...  I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... Roundpants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment.  Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh!  Here are the applications.  Let's see here. ""Name.""  SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well.  Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers!  Question two. ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" Hmm, what's a felony?"
"Squidward"," Being too darn happy all the time!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies."
"Squidward","  Moron."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on here?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm filling out an application."
"Mr. Krabs"," Get to work."
"SpongeBob","  Then I got the job?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh boy. "
"SpongeBob"," My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo!"
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"SpongeBob","  You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'd love to."
"SpongeBob"," Yay! "
"Squidward"," But...no! Don't... "
"SpongeBob"," So what do I do first? "
"Squidward","  Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill. "
"SpongeBob"," Shouldn't you watch it?"
"Squidward"," Why? I don't think it's going anywhere."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, very Zen.  What next, oh, oracle of Krabby wisdom?"
"Squidward"," I'm going to the bathroom."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, I'll go, too.  How's it going in there, boss?"
"Squidward"," Um... fine."
"SpongeBob","  Going fine.  Oh, Mr. Squidward...  Whatcha reading?  Bathroom break. Check. "
"Squidward"," Here's the slop you ordered.  Enjoy. If you can choke it down."
"SpongeBob","  Be rude to customers and insult food. Nasally laugh. "
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Oh I think you've had way too many of those. "
"Squidward"," Taught him everything he knows. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants."
"SpongeBob"," I am not SpongeBob SquarePants, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," What in the name of Davy Jones are you talking about?"
"SpongeBob"," I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, so?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who told you that?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, why don't you just take them off? "
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward."
"Sandy"," Well if it isn't SpongeBob UnderPants. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't they look peaceful?"
"Patrick"," Yeah...wake up!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Mermai...  Umph! I can't believe Mermaid Man hit me with his Mermerang... It's so awesome!"
"Patrick"," Wow!  can you beat me up next?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure thing. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, It came back!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll try again."
"Patrick"," Wow! That Mermerang really likes you!"
"SpongeBob"," I know!"
"SpongeBob","  I've got it! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi... How ya feeling?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I almost forgot!"
"SpongeBob"," I brought you flowers! Since you two are feeling so poorly."
"Patrick"," You never brought me flowers."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, go home and check your mailbox."
"Patrick"," Really?"
"SpongeBob","  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Patrick and I can do it Mermaid Man!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Because, we're card carrying members of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fan club."
"SpongeBob"," We're also, certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators."
"Patrick"," Certified!"
"Patrick"," Yay!"
"Patrick","  Heroes! Heroes! Hero...  ...oes."
"SpongeBob","  We're ready! Man Bob!"
"Patrick"," And Pat Boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Got it!"
"Patrick"," Got what?"
"SpongeBob"," Shuffle boarding is exciting, huh Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Well duh!"
"SpongeBob"," What's your favorite thing about shuffle boarding?"
"Patrick"," Everything! It's even fun just to say the word! Shee-uf-fle-boarde!"
"SpongeBob"," Shu-ee-uu-ee-ufflelele-board!  It is fun!"
"Patrick"," We are seriously going to kick some elderly buns today! Huh SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Wha?"
"Patrick","  Out of the way gramps! That's my trophy old lady!  It's going to be and action packed thrill ride of geriatric proportions! And the best part is, there is no way we can lose with these costumes on!"
"SpongeBob"," We already won the tournament."
"Patrick"," Oh... ya, I forgot.  Well how come I didn't get a trophy?!"
"SpongeBob"," You did, it's in your back pocket."
"Patrick","  Oh ya, I forgot. Well Let's go do something else."
"SpongeBob"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Ohhh! Patrick! Stop! We can't. We have to get the costumes back."
"Patrick"," For Neptune's sake SpongeBob, if we're not going to go around town pretending to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, then who is?!"
"SpongeBob"," Nobody?"
"Patrick"," Exactly. And with no one patrolling the town, who's gonna stop those youngsters from loitering? "
"SpongeBob"," Their mommies?"
"Patrick"," No! We are! Let's take 'em to the slammer!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Don't you think that's too harsh?"
"Patrick"," Too harsh?  Explain."
"SpongeBob","  Wasting a Krabby Patty?! How could you?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty! Mr. Jail Warden!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right Patboy! This town needs us!"
"Patrick"," You're chewing too loud! "
"SpongeBob"," Your shoe's untied! "
"Patrick"," You're too old! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I think we've done our work Patrick. Now, let's return these costumes."
"SpongeBob"," Uuhhhhhh! That's the evil Man Ray!"
"SpongeBob"," What diabolical plan could he be up to!?"
"SpongeBob"," Look at him Patrick! Plotting with his evil minion!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll bet he's handing off some secret weapon! Time to crash this party!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello Man Ray! Who's your friend?"
"SpongeBob"," Alright Mable, that's enough chitchat! Now are you gonna come quietly, or will we have to take you to jail by force!?"
"SpongeBob"," Playing dumb ay?"
"Patrick"," You handle Man Ray, I'll take care of his lackey."
"SpongeBob"," Hiiiiiii-ya! Eat dryer sheets Man Ray!"
"SpongeBob"," Whooooaaaaa!"
"Patrick"," Ohhhh!"
"SpongeBob","  Not so fast Man Ray!"
"SpongeBob"," You're all wet, you need to dry out."
"SpongeBob"," Just keep moving."
"Patrick"," You too missy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, our work is done here."
"SpongeBob"," Just doing our Mermaduty."
"Patrick","  And then some."
"SpongeBob","  And then some!  That's a good one!"
"SpongeBob","  They have so many fans! "
"Squidward"," What is?"
"Squidward"," Alright, I've had enough!  Bunch of nonsense!"
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles."
"Squidward"," Why?"
"Squidward"," My very own music class? Did you say ""Squilliam Fancyson""?"
"Squidward"," I'm... Squilliam Fancyson."
"Squidward"," It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!"
"Squidward","  Oh."
"Squidward"," Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well. "
"Squidward","  Good evening, students. Now, our first..."
"Squidward"," As I was saying, our first..."
"Squidward"," Yes?"
"Squidward"," My-my name? What for?"
"Squidward","  Why don't you come write your name on the board? We'll see how you like it."
"Squidward"," There, now how does that feel, Billy?"
"Squidward"," Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?!  Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to..."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, look! It's Squid... "
"Squidward"," Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say ""Squilliam""!"
"Patrick"," Oh, a, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid... "
"Squidward","  Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand.  Okay, good.  Hey, he blinked three times!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I'll say."
"Squidward"," Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument!"
"Squidward"," You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!"
"Patrick"," It was. I traded with SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," And I have been very happy with the results. See? "
"Squidward"," Wow, those are impressive results."
"Squidward","  As you may not be aware, music is a...  Music is a...  Music is a complicated series of...  ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the...  SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam.  Patrick here keeps tickling my foot."
"Patrick"," No way! He's making that up! It was him!"
"Squidward"," You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?"
"Patrick"," You better tell him, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Alright, it was me."
"Squidward"," You were tickling yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," Mm hmm!"
"Squidward"," How?"
"SpongeBob"," Like this. "
"Squidward"," Alright, that's enough!"
"Squidward"," There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex...  SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!"
"Patrick"," Actually, that time, it really was me."
"Squidward"," Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard.  Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?"
"Patrick"," Uh-uh."
"Squidward"," Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important."
"Patrick"," Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track."
"Squidward"," I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!"
"Patrick"," Well, actually, there was a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap. "
"Squidward"," I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!"
"Patrick"," Well, I don't know. Suits my needs."
"Squidward"," What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive? "
"Patrick"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?"
"Squidward"," Now, where were...  ...we?"
"Squidward"," This is what's known as a metronome."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden!"
"Squidward"," No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome."
"Squidward","  Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time."
"Squidward"," Do you mind?  Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!"
"SpongeBob"," My whole life has been pointed in one direction."
"Patrick"," I see that now. There's never been any choice for me."
"Squidward"," Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna..."
"Squidward"," Please ignore them."
"Squidward"," Nope, they're just morons. Come on, you two, snap out of it!"
"Squidward"," Hotter? Scoop?!"
"Squidward"," Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!! "
"SpongeBob"," Wha...? Where am I? I felt like I was in some sort of horrible trance. "
"Squidward"," You wanna know what happened?"
"Squidward"," You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!"
"Squidward"," Now, I don't suppose you two have anything to say for yourselves?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess if I was to say one thing, it would have to be We're sorry, Squidward. "
"Patrick"," Yeah, we're sorry, Squidward."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, no, no! Shh shh shh..."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, no, no! They said ""Squilliam""!"
"Squidward"," No! Wait!  No! You're not going anywhere!"
"Squidward"," Wha-What's going on here?"
"Squidward"," But..."
"Patrick"," Okay SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay Patrick! Here I come! "
"Patrick"," Nice landing!  Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking."
"Patrick"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!"
"Patrick"," Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball."
"SpongeBob"," Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!"
"Patrick"," There's nothing to be afraid of SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Looks like he's taking a fancy to you."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back."
"Patrick"," That sounds delightful! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up  Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right."
"SpongeBob"," Oh hi Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend."
"SpongeBob"," That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. "
"Patrick"," Something tells me they don't like each other."
"SpongeBob"," Come on little guys, let's take five and be friendly now. See just say hi. That's it, that's it And there you go. See friends.  Oh my goodness! Patrick please do something. Aaaaaaaaaahhh......."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now."
"SpongeBob"," Okay Patrick see you later then.  Aaaaaaaahhhh......"
"SpongeBob"," All right Gary, so there isn't more upset, you're going to sleep at the guest newspaper tonight, while Mr. Wormsley is sleeping herewith me.  Now, now Gary don't be rude.  See I set it all nice just for you.There you are.  Good night Gary. "
"SpongeBob","  Must have been Patrick is doing his night fits again. Okay I'll just close the window.  Mr. Wormsley!  Woaaaaahh! I'll just call for help. What ever you do don't move."
"SpongeBob"," He's in here.  Oh! I can't watch!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a Mrs. Wormsley. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Patrick its a miracle."
"Patrick"," That it is."
"SpongeBob"," Wait 'till Gary sees."
"Patrick"," Yeah! wait 'till."
"SpongeBob"," Here Gary right in here. They're gone asleep."
"SpongeBob"," He's chased her away! Now who will care for her abandoned newborn infants?"
"Patrick"," Maybe you could take care of them."
"SpongeBob"," I dunno Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset. I guess we'll just have to find homes for each and every one of them. Right, Pat? Patrick? "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob? Don't you know that it's 700 in the morning?"
"SpongeBob"," How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?"
"Squidward"," Don't you know that it's 700 in the—huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Baby worms."
"Squidward","  "
"SpongeBob"," So, How many did you want?  "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Would you like a baby worm?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you.  Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some...  Ma'am?  That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?"
"SpongeBob"," Probably not."
"SpongeBob"," So I see."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Larry, wait."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms."
"SpongeBob"," Well, yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Larry, no! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised.  Hello?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work!  Hello?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live."
"Mr. Krabs"," Babies?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies."
"SpongeBob"," Well, okay."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey there, little critters.  Come to... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he likes you."
"Mr. Krabs","  Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto!  Blech! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you say ""fortune?""   $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks."
"SpongeBob"," Enjoy your new home, little guy."
"SpongeBob"," That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad."
"SpongeBob"," What's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know. I've never been to the old country! "
"Plankton"," Oh, come on Karen, please!"
"Plankton","  There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise.   Delectable!"
"Plankton"," Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!"
"Plankton"," We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast."
"Plankton","  Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab which is located directly across the street!"
"Plankton","  Any time. What is wrong with people?! Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, ""Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!"""
"Plankton"," You know Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall. "
"Plankton"," Oh come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!"
"Plankton"," My eye is burning and I don't know why!"
"Plankton","  Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?"
"Plankton"," Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!"
"Plankton"," I'll show you woman! "
"Plankton"," Oh Karen!"
"Plankton"," Could you come here for a moment?"
"Plankton"," Feast your, uh, screen on this. "
"Plankton"," Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind."
"Plankton"," Good morning T-119A!"
"Plankton"," They're supposed to do that.  Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement."
"Plankton"," And now Karen, the piece de resistance.  Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?"
"Plankton"," I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right."
"Plankton"," Okay here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!?"
"Plankton"," You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer."
"Plankton"," Because you were the one that said—"
"Plankton"," Dear Neptune!"
"Plankton"," Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!"
"Plankton"," Not that one!"
"Plankton"," You know Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive."
"Plankton"," That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!"
"Plankton"," Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you!  Karen? What's this?  It's words on paper. It says ""Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen."" Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error.  Ow!  ""P.S., don't forget to blink."" Oh yeah. "
"Plankton"," Okay team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?"
"Plankton"," I said, does everybody understand!?"
"Plankton"," All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!"
"Plankton"," Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!"
"Squidward"," Why is the local news always such rubbish!?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, nobody cares about... "
"Plankton"," Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay boy, get out there. "
"SpongeBob"," Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir?  Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?"
"Plankton"," I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhhhhh, uuh uuh."
"Plankton"," Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to Krusty Krab. Got it?"
"SpongeBob","  Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?"
"Plankton","  Uhhh! Forget it!  Bring on the Boom Boom!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Battle stations men! Here he comes!"
"SpongeBob"," We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed!"
"Squidward","  Later."
"Plankton"," Hey, what gives?"
"Plankton","  Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone. "
"Plankton","  Karen! You've come back to me!"
"Plankton"," Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!"
"Plankton"," What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?"
"Plankton"," Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?"
"Plankton"," Or we could go out! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty-three, four hundred and fifty-four, four hundred and fifty-five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there. "
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret."
"SpongeBob","  You have a secret?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cuticles. "
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir. And who will be ""in charge"" while you're gone."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh,  well, not Squidward.  No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're in charge for the next 15 minutes."
"SpongeBob"," I'm... in charge?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes "
"SpongeBob"," Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?"
"Squidward"," Krabs is gone?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes."
"Squidward"," Wow."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge.  Charge. Charge. "
"Squidward"," Wake me up when I care. "
"SpongeBob"," Do you care now?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?"
"Squidward","  What?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's just that I'm in charge and..."
"Squidward","  And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?"
"SpongeBob"," Regulary scheduled nap?"
"Squidward"," This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward"," But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I, um..."
"Squidward"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab. "
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on."
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties. "
"Squidward"," So do it when you're done."
"SpongeBob"," And unclog the sink."
"Squidward"," Would you like to hear a secret?"
"SpongeBob","  What kind of secret?"
"Squidward"," See that guy over there? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Squidward"," He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!"
"SpongeBob"," Me?"
"Squidward"," Why don't you give him a couple of pointers. Let him cook his own patty, and don't take ""no"" for an answer. He's shy.  This should be good."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire."
"SpongeBob"," I know your secret..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!"
"Squidward"," Moron."
"SpongeBob"," Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?"
"SpongeBob"," First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula!  So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!"
"Squidward"," Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!"
"SpongeBob"," Order number 12!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what're you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Taking out an order!"
"Squidward"," You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?"
"SpongeBob"," They are?"
"Squidward"," Your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! . It's all coming clear to me now.  There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink.  Enjoy."
"Squidward"," What? "
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh!  It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob. What is all this junk?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, have fun with that."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward. I'm in charge, so you'll be having all the fun."
"Squidward"," Doing what?"
"SpongeBob"," Painting the walls, buffing the tables, sewing pretty curtains, washing the windows, varnishing the stools, hanging the ferns, waxing the toilets. Oh you lucky dog!"
"Squidward","  Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?"
"SpongeBob"," There's another secret? What's the secret?"
"Squidward"," Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?"
"SpongeBob"," How?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!"
"SpongeBob"," Sounds like the Chum Bucket."
"Squidward"," Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose."
"SpongeBob"," Oh...  How's this, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Lookin' good!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean, ""lookin' bad!"" Enjoy our fine decor!"
"SpongeBob"," One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!"
"Squidward"," Mmm, you missed a spot."
"SpongeBob"," Got it!  Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?"
"Squidward"," Lower!"
"SpongeBob"," Initiating stage two collateral damage!  How was that?"
"Squidward"," Perfect!"
"SpongeBob"," Ehh..."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, all the customers are leaving!"
"Squidward"," What did we talk about?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't touch the material."
"Squidward"," If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! You don't want to miss... This!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man!  Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager.  What the...?! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?"
"SpongeBob"," And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Me customers cowering in fear?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?"
"Mr. Krabs","  And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties?!  Squidward sleeping on the job?! Ok, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All my secrets...?  So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob?  Ah, Gwenevere!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello?"
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob. How's it going?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hiya, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could come by tonight."
"SpongeBob"," Sure! What's up?"
"Sandy"," I whipped up an invention I'm gonna unveil tonight in front of my comrades, and I need you to be my test subject!"
"SpongeBob"," I will be there!"
"Sandy"," You're not gonna forget, are ya?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course not! Have I ever let you down before?  Hello?"
"Sandy"," Just be here!"
"SpongeBob"," With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Miss Cheeks!  I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, how the barnacles do you put this thing together? "
"SpongeBob"," I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! Good morning, cap'n! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down, down! I won't let Sandy down! Right after work I'm going over to Sandy's, who I'm not gonna let down."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've got a special assignment for you. This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in. "
"SpongeBob"," ""Telescope Assembly Manual""..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight."
"SpongeBob"," Tonight?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not gonna be a problem, is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm... Well, actually..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card... ...and it appears the ""Does Laborious Task for Supervisor"" box is unchecked. See ya tonight!"
"SpongeBob"," What am I gonna do?  You can do it. You made the commitments, you have to honor them. Both of them."
"Patrick","  Who're you talking to, buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hiya, Patrick. What're you doing back here? "
"Patrick"," Sorry to disturb you during work hours. I just wanted to remind you about my birthday."
"SpongeBob"," No need to remind me! I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday!"
"Patrick"," Then why aren't you saying the words?"
"SpongeBob"," What words?"
"Patrick"," ""Happy birthday""! It's today! My birthday's today!  Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh..."
"Patrick"," My birthday cake! You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!"
"SpongeBob"," Tonight?"
"Patrick"," Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined!  Right! Time to be all I can be!  Man, these people sure look science-y. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops for this one.  Hey, Sandy! What'cha doing?"
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob! Just putting the finishing touches on my invention. Thanks for assisting me! You're such a big help! No wonder Mr. Krabs relies on you so heavily. "
"SpongeBob","  I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta run to the, uh, gents' room.  Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!"
"SpongeBob"," You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record.  Ok, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472, section C-17, that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies."
"SpongeBob"," I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card..."
"SpongeBob","  ""Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day. Please call again."" Barnacles! Where can I find a motorized hex drill now? "
"Sandy","  Just finishin' up here!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!  Heh, oh, hey, Patrick! What're you doing in town?"
"Patrick"," I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party.  You didn't forget my party, did you?"
"SpongeBob"," Forget? How can I forget my best friend's birthday party?"
"Patrick"," You're already forgetting one thing!"
"SpongeBob"," Ha, ha! No, I haven't!... Have I?"
"Patrick"," Hello!?! My birthday cake!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, that! I w... I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are! Now, you just go home, and I'm gonna go get your cake, you silly guy, you!  Hi! I need a birthday cake!"
"SpongeBob","  ""Sorry About the Scabies"". Um, can you change it to say ""Happy Birthday""?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, here you are.  Sandy's drill! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hi! I was just, uh, making sure you had your hardware!"
"Sandy"," Well, that's an unusual getup. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I just thought I'd be a little festive, you know, for the scientists..."
"Sandy"," And the birthday cake?  Greetings, my distinguished colleagues! Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever! Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine."
"SpongeBob"," What? "
"Sandy"," Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing. It is because...  What's under your gown? "
"SpongeBob"," It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back!  Happy birthday! "
"Patrick"," You finally made it! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic... Storm."
"Patrick"," Well, just leave my present over on the present table! "
"SpongeBob"," Your present?"
"Patrick"," I'm so excited, I've been waiting for a whole year!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got it, it's right here!  Tada! See, all wrapped up and ready to go! "
"Patrick"," Well, what're you waiting for, buddy? Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present!"
"SpongeBob"," The cake! I must've left it at Sandy's!"
"Patrick"," You took it to Sandy's?"
"SpongeBob"," No! I said ""The bakery delivers, isn't that handy?"". In fact, I think I hear them right now outside! Wait there while I go check. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, barnacles. "
"Sandy"," I apologize for the delay. Now let's continue the demonstration. I give you, the Protogenerator 2000!  This device gives a single laborer the productivity of 5, 6, 7, up to 8 workers...  ...which is great for the management, but is also a boom for the workers because they'll always get high marks on their employee report card! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I was just looking at your employee report card..."
"SpongeBob","  The telescope!"
"Sandy"," Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the proceedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back.  Ok, let's get started."
"Mr. Krabs"," What happened to your clothes, boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick's rock? Whatcha do with it there?  SpongeBob, wait! Get back here, boy! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?"
"SpongeBob","  Never mind that, could I please borrow your present?"
"Patrick"," No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!"
"SpongeBob"," Not even for a minute?"
"Patrick"," No, not till you deliver my birthday cake."
"SpongeBob"," OK, I'll be right back! "
"Patrick"," Hold on, where're you going? "
"Sandy"," Hold it! Where is my little assistant going this time? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Your little assistant? That's my assistant you're talking to! What's going on here!?!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!"
"Sandy"," That looks like my power drill! You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister! "
"SpongeBob","  I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so... I have got something to say!  I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, your telescope. Patrick, your birthday. Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say ""no"" to any of you."
"Sandy"," Aw, you overextended yourself."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, you should've said something."
"Patrick"," We could've worked something out."
"SpongeBob"," Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once."
"Sandy"," Nonsense, SpongeBob! Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000!  First, I close the protochamber...  ...And finally... she presses a button, and there is a glowing light from the chamber, everyone gasps as 2 SpongeBobs emerge from the tube]"
"Sandy"," As you can see, I've made 2 clones of my subject which will allow him to honor all of the commitments he's made this evening.  You hear that, SpongeBob? You can be in three places at once now! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing out here, silly?"
"Patrick"," I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away.  Oh, barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!"
"SpongeBob"," That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work."
"Patrick"," Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy."
"Patrick"," Ugh! I hate that hat!  Fine, have it your way, hat!  Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What? "
"Patrick"," Oh no! He's got the hat, too!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then."
"Patrick"," I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad. What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy.  That sounds like... a band of roaming tourists.  Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day?  What are you doing there, Patrick? "
"Patrick"," Standin' around out here all day."
"Mr. Krabs"," How would you like a job, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh boy, gimme my hat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign.  That's not too tough for ya, is it boy?"
"Patrick"," Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat.  How's this?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all.  Hee hee hee."
"SpongeBob"," What's shakin' Mr. K?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're buddy Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he is good."
"Mr. Krabs"," And look. He's about reel in his first customer."
"Mr. Krabs"," What does he think he's doing?!  They're walkin' right past him.  Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy."
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something.  Just keep workin' on that one, eh boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl."
"Patrick"," Any thing for my new hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's enough Patrick!"
"Patrick"," I did it! Did you see that Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I saw it."
"Patrick"," Do I get my hat now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ehhh... what the heck. It pays to advertise. "
"Patrick"," Yeah! Wheeee! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Sometimes when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand!"
"SpongeBob"," He's nervous."
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean, cash money?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Five dollars please. Alright."
"Mr. Krabs"," There's that sound again. They're loving it. Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous blackdoodle."
"Patrick"," I did?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, I think we've finally found a job for you that you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab. For just five dollars a head."
"Squidward"," It's official.  I hate everyone.  You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Brace yourself for true entertainment! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Are you okay?"
"Patrick"," I'm fine."
"Mr. Krabs"," What the barnacles is going on out here?"
"Squidward"," I'm entertaining those heathens."
"Mr. Krabs"," We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much!  Hey, where'd he go?"
"SpongeBob","  That's buddy. Come on."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's with him?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home."
"Mr. Krabs"," A bloody nose, eh? Do ya think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now everybody, get back to work! I'm not running a hapy factory here!  Keep up the good work, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," You got it, Mr. K!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! What's going on?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, so what if he flopped from two boxes...?  ...into a cream pie? "
"Patrick"," I like pie."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay boy, let 'er rip!  I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!"
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?"
"Patrick","  I feel like a million bucks... "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something!  OK, that's it! No best friend of mine is going to suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm going to go have a talk with him right -"
"Patrick","  No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years people have been telling me, “You're no good!” Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick! "
"SpongeBob"," OK, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing."
"Patrick"," What's that, pal?"
"SpongeBob"," Just be careful, hm?"
"Patrick","  Thanks pal."
"SpongeBob"," I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. "
"Mr. Krabs"," See the part time minimum wage employee fall from high atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Mr Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's OK, boy, he signed a waiver.  Is he ready, Mr Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Ready!"
"Mr. Krabs"," OK! Get back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform."
"Patrick"," Hey, good idea. Hey, Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt?  Thanks buddy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Ready! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I can't watch! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!"
"Patrick"," I'm trying!"
"Patrick"," Argh, I think I'm stuck!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stuck? Well if that don't …  What's the hold up, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick, why have you stopped falling?"
"Patrick"," I dunno, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well you'd better figure it out. These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation. Now make with the cods-wallop, pal, understand?"
"Patrick"," Uh huh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't make me come back here."
"Patrick"," Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know … "
"Squidward"," You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. OK, I'll do it! "
"Patrick"," Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you belong, aaaah! ."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't think so."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you."
"Patrick"," Look, Squidward, I'm falling!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm so happy for you!"
"Patrick"," I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!"
"SpongeBob"," So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry, absolutely no refunds.  Hold on there, what's the big idea?  Grandma, help!  All right, you leave me no choice."
"Patrick"," You're giving me a raise."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not even close, you're fired.  As long as I'm still standing, you will never wear this hat again! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you OK?"
"Patrick"," Well, I guess it's back to being to No Hat Pat! "
"SpongeBob","  It's OK, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want."
"Patrick"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, pal."
"Patrick","  Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!"
"SpongeBob"," Anytime, pal! Anytime!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh......Patrick"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," Whaddya wanna do today?"
"Patrick"," I don't know."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess we could play something. How about a yo—?"
"Patrick"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Yo. Buried Treasure Board Game?"
"Patrick"," Nah."
"SpongeBob"," Dolly?"
"Patrick"," Hm.....nope. No. Nope. Nope. Uh-uh. No. Nah."
"SpongeBob"," How about this?"
"Patrick"," Uh-uh."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy."
"Patrick","  Yeah, that'll happen."
"SpongeBob"," Ugh, there is just nothing to play with."
"Patrick"," There's gotta be something we can do."
"Squidward","  Ladda-de ladd-dum ladda-do... Hey! What are you doing in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?"
"Squidward"," Get out!"
"Patrick"," We hadn't thought of that one."
"Squidward","  I believe this pile belongs to you. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Ugh. I'm so bored. There's gotta be something we can do! "
"Patrick","  Almost there!"
"Patrick","  Here it is!"
"SpongeBob","  Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest...  Toy store?!  Ahhhhh!"
"Patrick"," Ohhhhh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, we're here."
"Patrick"," But where's the toy store?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess it's not open yet."
"Patrick"," Not...open?"
"Patrick"," We wanted to go to the toy store, but it's not open yet."
"Patrick"," Mm-hm."
"SpongeBob"," I got this.  Patrick! Patrick, get up..."
"Patrick"," Uh, no thanks. I'm good down here."
"SpongeBob"," Look.  Wow!  Patrick, look at that. "
"Patrick"," Wow."
"SpongeBob"," That depends. Tell me. Do you like to  sing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahem!  La..."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah!♪ Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob. What’s with the tutu?"
"SpongeBob"," It's not a tutu! It's a man-tu! You can tell because it has  extra support.  I got the last one."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh. "
"SpongeBob"," What a great day! I hope it never ends!"
"Patrick"," Never!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw. The store's closing. We'll have to leave now."
"Patrick"," What part of ""never"" don't you understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we have to leave."
"Patrick"," Huh! I'm not moving."
"SpongeBob"," But they'll just come and kick us out!"
"Patrick"," Not if we hide."
"SpongeBob"," Hide? Isn't that kinda sneaky?"
"Patrick"," Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," No. But I do now. What do we do first?!"
"Patrick"," We need to find a hiding spot where they'll never find us. And I know just the place."
"Patrick"," The coast is clear."
"Patrick"," Push, SpongeBob! Push! Push, man, push!  Okay, SpongeBob gimmie your hand. That's my boy. Brace yourself."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, pal. Well, we did it. Yay! "
"Patrick"," Yay! Oh, this is so awesome."
"SpongeBob"," Nothing can ruin it!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is that you?"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I said, ""Is that you?"""
"Patrick"," I can't hear you! It's too dark in here! Don't worry. I'll just use my Night Vision."
"SpongeBob"," You have Night Vision?"
"Patrick","  Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," How long have you had that?"
"Patrick"," Remember that flashlight I shoved up my ear?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Patrick"," Well, I guess it worked its way into my brain.  Shoot! The batteries are dead! It's dark... and scary! "
"SpongeBob"," Calm down, buddy. We just need to find a light switch. But ya have to put me down first."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Right, SpongeBob. I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns all peachy!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"Patrick"," Look around you, SpongeBob! We're surrounded!"
"SpongeBob"," By... toys?"
"Patrick"," That...want...to...get us."
"SpongeBob","  Gah!!!  Eeeeeeee!!!"
"Patrick"," Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick"," Are we going to the ladies’ room again?"
"SpongeBob"," No. We're going to fight back and we are going to win!"
"Patrick"," That was fun! Now let's dress up like fairy princesses! ."
"SpongeBob"," Ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Let's get some!"
"SpongeBob"," It was nice knowin' ya, pal."
"Patrick"," I know. I'm an interesting guy."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," My eyes!!"
"Patrick","  With Neptune as my witness, may you never experience the unholy terrors that are inside that store. Hey, they're open!  I love toys!"
"SpongeBob","  Get up Patrick! It's time! "
"Patrick","  Time for what?"
"SpongeBob"," The big shin-dig! Remember?"
"Patrick"," No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today. "
"SpongeBob"," That's shin dig buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship."
"Patrick"," The beach! Just you and me!?  So am I ready for the beach SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine!  I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend. "
"SpongeBob"," ] Guess what?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to the beach with my best friend!!!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?"
"SpongeBob"," You know what this situation calls for. Patrick!  A few verses of the best friend tune! ♪Ohhhh best fr-♪  Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are."
"Patrick"," I knew it! We've been abandoned!"
"SpongeBob"," No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here! "
"SpongeBob"," Look Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!"
"Patrick"," Small plastic disc that you throw!!!  I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!"
"SpongeBob"," I do too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name."
"Patrick"," Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?"
"SpongeBob"," Perfect! Now run along, Patrick and I'll  toss it to you!"
"Patrick","  Ha ha ha ha."
"SpongeBob"," Ready?! "
"Patrick","  I caught it!  Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," Like what?"
"Patrick"," Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring."
"SpongeBob"," Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or..."
"Patrick"," Boring, SpongeBob, boring!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, we can make sand castles!"
"Patrick"," That sounds  un-boring!"""
"SpongeBob"," No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?"
"Patrick","  Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over. "
"Patrick"," Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just trying to help, buddy!"
"Patrick"," Well, I don't need any help."
"Patrick"," Why thank you. Here's a little something for you."" "
"SpongeBob"," Well I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side."
"Patrick","  Now, we're even!"
"SpongeBob"," All right Patrick, have it your way.  ""You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. "
"Patrick","  Now this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle! "
"SpongeBob","  I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh sir, you built onto my side."
"Patrick"," So?"
"SpongeBob","  So, you don't do that!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border."
"Patrick"," You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for! "
"SpongeBob"," But what for what!?"
"Patrick","  Now we're even... again!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!""  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?"
"Patrick"," This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh is that so!?"" Well if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is"
"Patrick"," No way! You started it."
"SpongeBob"," Fine! Have it your way."
"Patrick","  Whatever.  No no no no no.  Oh hello! And goodbye. "
"SpongeBob"," Come on!  How do you like them apples "
"Patrick","  You'll never win! Do you hear me!?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?"
"Patrick","  I like you this much!  Feel me!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?"
"Patrick","  The question is... will you be!?  No fair!"
"SpongeBob","  All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun! "
"Patrick","  Oh ya! Two can play at this game! "
"SpongeBob","  Jumping jellyfish! WHOA! "
"Patrick"," I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice. "
"SpongeBob","  Ohhhh."
"Patrick","  Ohhhh. What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll tell you what happened Patrick... I got carried away."
"Patrick"," Me too...was it worth it?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. "
"Patrick"," I bet I can clean up faster than you!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah? I bet you can't!"
"Patrick"," Yes, I can!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I can!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I can!"
"SpongeBob"," I can!"
"Patrick"," Hey, look at this!"
"SpongeBob","  Phew! "
"SpongeBob","  Hello, hello!  Huh? The lines been cut.  Barnacles!"
"SpongeBob","  I guess I go better take a look. "
"SpongeBob","  Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed.  Whoa! Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Ha, hey!  Ah Ha! Wind-Up novelty teeth. How did you wind up down here . "
"SpongeBob"," What the heck is going on with my fancy boot?  Hey, knock it off! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, I warned you!  You're a dirty fighter! Hmn, I gotcha now! Hi ya! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary?  Noooooooooo! "
"SpongeBob"," GARY!  Hooa!"
"SpongeBob"," Phew, thank goodness. For a moment there I thought you were hurt. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary, I... I broke your shell!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! You're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry about that. Oh, I know!  Here, just use a little tape and theerrre ya go, good as new!  Oh. Well, that's alright because we'll find a new shell for ya!"
"SpongeBob"," How about this? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, your right, too gaudy.  No, too last season.  Well, I need that. A-haha, look Gary.  Here, try this on for size."
"SpongeBob"," Of course it's a shell!  Oh c'mon, don't look at me like that. ."

"SpongeBob"," Here it is Gary. Your neeew shell. . You look ready to ride.  Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gair, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, page 72. Oh, here it is. Wow! . This stylish, fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic restroom facilities standard, and for the affordable price of $9,595.95! Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune!?"
"SpongeBob"," Commercial? What commercial? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry Angry Jack, eh Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Now it... really looks like the old one hey buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off hey, buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Oops. Hey, what about that one? "
"SpongeBob"," Oops, sorry Jack. Hey, how much is that one? "
"SpongeBob"," Good idea, angry."
"SpongeBob"," Well it... certainly is shiny."
"SpongeBob"," Ah that is bright. Can't... see! OW, what was that!? "
"SpongeBob"," Why... can't... I... stop... break-ing... shells!? "
"SpongeBob"," Whoops. Hey Jack I don't suppose you have any more to show me?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, wait, wait! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first,  shoes are tied, hands are de-ry  and now a thick layer of bubble wrap "
"SpongeBob"," You, er... sure you don't have any more in the back?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, look on the bright side, I reduced your inventory for ya."
"SpongeBob"," Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?"
"SpongeBob","  Take it, it's all my savings."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, that's all I got, honest."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages.  Hey, I've got an idea! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, what am I kidding, it looks terrible on you!"
"SpongeBob","  I know Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey boy, what's with all that snivelin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs. What are you doing here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I just, uh, well never mind that, boy. What's your problem?"
"SpongeBob"," I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement. I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There, there, boy. There, there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll thinka something."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times. I love helping others. Like helping meself Now, how much ya got?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. I see "

"SpongeBob","  I guess ""All's shell that ends shell. Huh, Gary?  Gary? Gary?  Gary?!"
"Plankton"," Okay, Karen. Which one's better? "
"Plankton","  Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers."
"Plankton"," Well, uh.....  ...like those customers, who just pulled up.  Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?"
"Plankton","  For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good. The chum is."
"Plankton"," Look, are you gonna eat or not!?"
"Plankton","  Now what was I saying? Oh right.  I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my business! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you! "
"Plankton","  What would that be?"
"Plankton"," Advertising?  I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this "
"Plankton","  Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! Chum is metabolic fuel! You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. ♪Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.♪ "
"Patrick"," Chum is... meh..."
"Plankton"," Hello sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?"
"Patrick"," ...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC..."
"Patrick"," ...METAB...BO... "
"Plankton"," Sir, your head, it's on fire.  THE DRINK, USE THE DRINK!"
"Patrick","  It's kelp juice, you want some? . HEY! What kind of friend are you?"
"Plankton"," Friend? I didn't even know y-"
"Patrick"," Go ahead. Say you're sorry."
"Plankton"," Uh, I'm sorry"
"Patrick"," Okay, I forgive you. And... I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?"
"Plankton"," Whatever."
"Patrick"," It's about your sign. These words make my head sad."
"Patrick"," It's okay little fella I don't either."
"Plankton"," OK, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes this sign will attract more than you can count."
"Patrick"," Uhh, what's that number before one?"
"Plankton"," Zero."
"Patrick"," Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!"
"Plankton"," Okay, so it may take a little longer than a few minutes."
"Patrick"," Wait, what are we doing again?  There we go! Chum is Fun!"
"Plankton"," What the? This says ""Chum is Fum."" You've changed my sign to ""Chum is Fum?"" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
"Patrick"," They seem to think it's interesting. "
"Plankton"," Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce.  Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?"
"Squidward"," They've all gone to the Chum Bucket."
"Mr. Krabs"," The Chum Bucket?  ""Chum...is...Fum?"" SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, we have a situation."
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it. "
"SpongeBob","  Five. "
"SpongeBob"," Four. "
"SpongeBob"," Three. "
"SpongeBob"," Two. "
"SpongeBob"," One. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh. Slide show."
"Mr. Krabs","  A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land.  There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly.  Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's my legs."
"Mr. Krabs","  He stole the Formuler. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought you'd say that.  So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Not so good, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on now. We're almost there."
"Plankton"," Next!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We made it SpongeBob. We're in! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous"
"SpongeBob","  Like that door? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh...BINGO! Giddy up boy, We're almost there. "
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"Plankton"," Excuse me, would you like a free sample?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, uh  I'm full thanks!"
"Plankton"," No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi! I don't want a free sampl-"
"Plankton","  Sure you do. LOOK OUT! SHE'S GONNA BLOW!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? Well he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?"
"Plankton"," Ah hehehehehehe  Chum is fum! Ah he he!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Come on SpongeBob..."
"Plankton"," I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing.  What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week Patrick? "
"Patrick","  Hm, huh?"
"Plankton","  Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy!  Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already. "
"Patrick"," OOH I like that one!"
"Plankton"," Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Keep up the good work...I guess..."
"Patrick"," You got it boss!"
"Plankton","  HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!"
"Plankton"," Hey Karen, check this out!"
"Plankton"," You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch! "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Plankton"," Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine."
"Plankton"," "
"Plankton"," Hmmmm...."
"Plankton","  PATRICK!"
"Patrick","  Huh?!"
"Plankton"," We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!"
"Patrick","  Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it."
"Plankton"," NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like ""Chum is Fum"" but different."
"Patrick"," Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm."
"Plankton","  Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick my boy, you really earned that promotion!"

"Patrick"," I know but I'm ""burned out."" See?  Anyway, you can send my check to my home."
"Plankton","  Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers  They're buffoons, morons, they'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb,  the stupidest of the stupid,  they're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads. I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?"
"Plankton"," Is it too late for sorry?  D'OH!"

"Plankton"," The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure!"
"Plankton"," And now the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench.  Thanks for asking. "
"Plankton"," Hey! What are you—?"
"Plankton"," Stop that at once! You—!"
"Plankton","  I command you to—!"
"Plankton","  Oh no!"
"Plankton","  Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside!"
"Plankton","  Special day?"
"Plankton","  Really? I accomplished something? What is it?"
"Plankton","  What?"
"Plankton","  Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!"

"Squidward","  Whatever."
"Plankton"," What??? Sorry. I wasn't listening.  Well, you can tell me later. "
"Plankton"," "
"SpongeBob"," And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat. "
"Squidward"," That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo—"
"SpongeBob","  Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like..."
"SpongeBob"," ...despair."
"Squidward"," That was probably me."
"SpongeBob"," No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over...  this way.  Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Wha—? SpongeBob?? Ahh...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry.  I'm...fine."
"SpongeBob"," Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob."
"Plankton"," Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary."
"SpongeBob"," Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?"
"Plankton"," Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything."
"SpongeBob","  We've got a  love emergency!  Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency!  Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do. You need to give her a present from  in here."

"Plankton"," Well we like to take long walks on the beach, and, uh, we like to talk about our dreams. Our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation...  ...and to trample our enemies beneath our feet. "
"SpongeBob","  Trampling enemies...  Now tell me about Karen."
"Plankton"," Well, she's a Mark-2 Surplus Unevec with 256 Gigs of RAM and uh, and there's the cutest little mole on her CPU, and the way she processes data... Eh-eh oooh mama!"

"Plankton"," Uhh... well, uhh  she does make a lot of beeping sounds."
"SpongeBob"," Interesting, does she ever go ""Ding!"""

"Plankton"," EEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whew!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you are ready!"
"Plankton"," Ready? But what do I sing?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside."
"Plankton"," Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?"
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Plankton."
"Plankton"," I don't think I'm ready."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy."
"Plankton"," No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it."
"SpongeBob","   Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you.  Ah, love."

"SpongeBob"," They're such a lovely couple.  The Krabby Patty Formula?!"
"Plankton"," Yes! You porous kitchen utensil! By helping me woo my computer wife, you've just doomed the Krusty Krab! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh No! I've got to stop it before it's too late."
"SpongeBob","  Control, Alt, Delete."
"SpongeBob","  How do ya turn this thing off?!"
"Plankton"," Get your hand off my wife!"
"SpongeBob","  The Plug.  Ha! You lose, Plankton."
"Plankton","  Oh No! You unplugged the coffee maker, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  I am so fired."
"Plankton"," Here it Comes!"
"Plankton"," That's Fantastic. Where's that formula?"
"Plankton"," Karen, what's wrong? Have you sprung a leak?"
"Plankton"," But you're shorting out."
"Plankton"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," No! "
"Plankton"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! I'm Saved! Your wife exploded!   Um... Happy Anniversary you guys. "
"Plankton"," E-M-I-L-P? What's E-M-I-L-P?!"
"Plankton"," Oh No."
"SpongeBob"," Good Morning, Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day. "
"Squidward","  What the?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, everybody, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Take a seat, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs","  Today's a big a day for the Krusty Krab.  So I want yous to listen up.  It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No. It's a holographic projection of the Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances."
"Squidward"," You mean the front door and the back door?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward."
"Squidward"," What? I have never fallen asleep on duty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't make me have a flashback."
"Squidward"," All right, point taken."
"Mr. Krabs"," And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some extra security."
"Squidward","  You hired Patrick?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters."
"Patrick","  Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton doesn't stand a chance."
"Plankton","  It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!"
"Plankton"," Oh, yeah? You try getting launched."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fore!"
"Plankton"," Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm tired today, Plankton.  You're just gonna have to launch yourself."
"Plankton"," Splat. "
"Plankton"," Karen?!"
"Plankton"," It's just no use!"
"Plankton"," You really think so?"
"Plankton"," Oh, Karen."
"Plankton"," I am."
"Plankton","  Yes, Ma'am!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Now to add some special anniversary deals to the menu.  Krabby Patty... 20 bucks. 39 bucks. 30.  Oh, number zero, how I love you so.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Y-Yes, Sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm putting you in charge of decorations."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," I thought you said that I was going to be in charge of decorations."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? But you are."
"SpongeBob"," I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! I had chores for you, but you won't do 'em anyway."
"Squidward"," It only took you eleventy-seven years for you to figure that out?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's your budget, boy.  Decorate it any way you want."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Fifty cents!"
"Squidward"," Your letting SpongeBob decorate? Remember all the other times SpongeBob decorated?"
"SpongeBob"," Yee-haw!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you come here often?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you want want to do it, then?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then shut your porthole."
"Squidward"," Battening down the word hatches, sir."
"Squidward"," What? What are you...?"
"SpongeBob"," There we go."
"SpongeBob"," Your change, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good work, boy. What, that's it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Decorations, check. Security?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Check."
"Mr. Krabs","  Okay, open your ears. These people have come from miles around because they love my patties. I want every employee on their best behavior."
"Squidward"," Are you getting any of this, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Every word, Squidward, every word."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, let's get out there and sell some Krabby Patties!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! Yeah! Ooh, I almost forgot. Mr. Krabs, wait! There's one last decoration!  I present to you...   I present to you...  ... my ode to the Krabby Patty  made entirely out of ice."
"Mr. Krabs"," Geez, boy.  This thing's enormous."
"Squidward","  and cold."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right let's get this thing out of here. Me customers are waiting."
"SpongeBob"," Ready? Set?  Guys, I'm okay. No need to scream."
"Mr. Krabs"," The door!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. Patrick, stand up!  We're locked in!  This is gonna spoil the eleventy-seventh anniversary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Somebody..."
"SpongeBob"," How do we get out?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Everybody, calm down. I spent a lifetime working in this restaurant, and I know there's only one way out of here."
"Patrick"," A high school diploma?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No,  the air duct.  This way boys.  All we have to do is head through this duct."
"Squidward"," Which one? There must be 20 ways to go."
"SpongeBob"," Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh, hmm, uh..."
"SpongeBob","  Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, according to the map, we just go straight, take a right between these three moldy tree stumps, then head towards that kidney-bean shaped pile of gravy."
"Squidward"," That's not the map, you old barnacle. those are  three moles and a birthmark."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. All right,  then, let's try this one."
"Squidward","  It's this way."
"Patrick"," Here it is."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days."
"Mr. Krabs","  ♪ Come on down and... ♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Back then, Krabby Patties only cost a dime.  It was a dark and  evil time.  I still have nightmares."
"Squidward"," We'll never get out of here."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Squidward. We'll find a way out and then we'll have the best eleventy-seventh anniversary ever. All we have to do is stick together."
"Squidward"," Stop breathing on my neck. Yuck."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, I think  I see the exit."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, barnacles. It's just the Surveillance Room."
"SpongeBob"," Oh. My house is on TV. All of our houses are on TV. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary the snail, you get down from that this instant."
"Patrick","  Hey, there's my house."
"Squidward"," You left your TV on."
"Patrick"," Well, duh. I don't want to miss my shows."
"SpongeBob","  Look, it's Sandy!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs,  Why do you have cameras watching us?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, uh... uh... uh...  I just want to make sure you all floss after ever meal."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you Mr. Krabs. Dental hygiene is very, very important."
"Patrick"," Pointing to a screen"
"SpongeBob"," I think that's us, Patrick.  But, who  are they?"
"Mr. Krabs","  We're  getting warm. I can feel it."
"SpongeBob"," That might just be my hand, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm, a crossroads.  I'll go this way, and SpongeBob,  you lead them down that way."
"SpongeBob"," Lead them? I can finally  use my leader hat...  and my lederhosen."
"Patrick"," Nice."
"Squidward"," Those are just sock garters, you idiot."
"SpongeBob"," Follow me!"
"Squidward"," This is not happening. It's just not happening."
"SpongeBob"," Guys, its a dead end."
"Plankton"," Thank Neptune that's over.  Uh-oh."
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob!  Why must you always ruin my plans?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton,  you're trying to steal the Krabby Patty recipe again."
"Plankton"," Uh, I didn't, uh... Okay fine. You caught me. You happy now?"
"SpongeBob"," You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories."
"Plankton"," Oh, you couldn't possibly bore me."
"SpongeBob"," Well, okay. Mr. Krabs called me into his office."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you."
"SpongeBob"," You mean?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, get into me office before anyone sees us."
"Plankton"," What? You just went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned in close and whispered the recipe."
"Plankton"," Yes? Go on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul."
"Plankton","  Wait!  Wait! Hold on!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's that?"
"Plankton"," My pen is out of ink.  Okay, okay, go ahead."
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton.  You'll never have get me formula.  Not even in a flashback."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, if you had never come to Bikini Bottom, this wouldn't be happening. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, what's with the creepy smile?"
"Squidward"," I was just  remembering the world before SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Good Morning, Not SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," But, Squidward, you're glad I moved in. Remember that day.  ah-uh.  Nah.  No. "
"Squidward"," My secret garden is finally done."
"SpongeBob"," It's beautiful.  I'll take it.   Hi, neighbor!  I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.  And we're going to be bestest friends.  Hey, Patrick. Guess, who just moved in right next door?"
"Patrick"," Neighbor hug!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the sound? Customers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no. All that loose change out there  is driving me wallet mad with money lust.  Poor little guy's starving.  There you go, boy. You're free. Go towards the money boy. Towards the money! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Oh, no!  What am I going to do?  We gotta get out of here. Now!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. If only Sandy was here. She could help us."
"Patrick"," Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet! Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come."
"Squidward"," Oh, give me that.  Sandy, come in, Sandy."
"Sandy","  Sandy Cheeks here.  So, it was  you who stole my other radio, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What? No. I'm just-- I"
"Patrick"," Sandy's trapped in that box!  Sandy?"
"SpongeBob"," Remember the day Sandy and I got married?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," I'm freaking out!"
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm."
"SpongeBob"," I do."
"Sandy"," And how!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Worst play I've ever seen.  And a total rip-off!"
"Patrick"," Oh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come back with me money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme."

"Patrick"," Hmm. You guys ready to give up?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Yes."
"Patrick"," And I'll just write my... myself down here for... forgiving up, too. Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, I don't want to give up."
"Patrick"," Ooh! I know. Uh, let's just say are tearful farewells and solemn last words, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't make any money."
"Squidward"," I never made anyone sick with envy."
"Patrick"," I didn't get to sleep in  this morning."
"SpongeBob"," Guys, we can't give up now. We got into this mess together, and we'll get ourselves out of it the same way."
"Patrick"," Through the freezer?"
"SpongeBob"," No. By using our heads."

"SpongeBob"," Good idea."
"SpongeBob"," Here we go."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating."
"SpongeBob"," Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it."

"SpongeBob"," Actually, I can't."
"Patrick"," Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Because I just stepped on one of these nails."
"Squidward"," Laa da dee, laa da da, laa da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—"

"Squidward"," No! I— what storm?"
"SpongeBob"," The one Preflumster told us about."
"Squidward"," Who's that?"
"Patrick"," He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said—"
"Squidward"," I can't understand a word you're saying."
"SpongeBob"," C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea..."

"Patrick"," I'm not seeing anything there."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk."
"Squidward"," What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!"
"Patrick"," Easy, friend."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Well played."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. You can do it."
"SpongeBob"," Be the puzzle piece."
"Patrick"," Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second. "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you."
"Patrick"," Eh? "
"SpongeBob"," Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!"
"Squidward"," Grrr!"
"SpongeBob"," Go, Patrick, go!"
"Squidward"," I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—"
"SpongeBob"," Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!"
"Patrick"," Who's the green guy?"
"Squidward"," It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating."
"Squidward"," Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over."
"Squidward"," I've got to get out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—"
"Squidward"," No, I can't."
"SpongeBob"," Please, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," No way."
"SpongeBob"," Please..."
"Squidward"," I have an even better idea."
"SpongeBob"," What is it?"
"Patrick"," Tell us."
"Squidward"," Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called ""boundaries."""
"Patrick"," Ooh-ooh-ooh!"
"Squidward"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Will there be any spelling in this game?"
"Squidward"," Oh, no, no spelling."
"Patrick"," Yes!"
"Squidward"," It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor."
"SpongeBob"," I have a question."
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Where are you going to get the chalk?"
"Squidward"," I brought some!"
"Squidward"," Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food. "
"SpongeBob"," Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary."
"Squidward"," I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross."
"SpongeBob"," If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers."
"Squidward"," Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. You may be telling the truth."
"Squidward"," Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry."
"SpongeBob"," But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth."
"Squidward"," That'll be the day."
"SpongeBob"," Stop that cephalopod!"
"Squidward"," Please. I just want to get back onto my side of boundary."
"SpongeBob"," This, I cannot allow. It's against the rules."
"Squidward"," But all I wanted was something to eat."
"Patrick"," Did somebody say something to eat?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look out!"
"Squidward"," Whoa! "
"Squidward"," My food!"
"SpongeBob"," Your food?"
"Patrick"," Hey, I want some too."
"Squidward"," Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?"
"SpongeBob"," Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways."
"Squidward"," Did you hear that?"
"SpongeBob"," It's just Patrick gnawing on his can."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside."
"SpongeBob"," I don't hear anything."
"Squidward"," The storm must've stopped."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait!"
"Squidward"," Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers! "
"Squidward"," Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And good riddance! Next time, you should read our sign about the mandatory side of fries policy!  Lookie, another flat-eyed, bushy-tailed customer!"
"Mr. Krabs","  —stop spending money here? Well, don't worry, I'm certainly not going to keep you from doing what you want. Give him a Krabby Patty with the works!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that's funny. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll think about that one while you buy a kelp soda.  Boy, you're doing it all wrong! Here, take this.  Now you can flip 2 patties at the same time; do twice the work! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you're a—"
"Mr. Krabs"," —genius? Perhaps. Or maybe I'm just a little off."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, if only I was a little off."
"Mr. Krabs"," Me formula! Darn these flimsy nails! How am I supposed to hide me formula with this nonsense? Ah, well. It's the life I choose to live."
"Plankton"," Did you see that?"
"Plankton"," So, everything, that means I know where it is!"
"Plankton"," Ugh, what kind of wife...? We'll just see about that."
"Plankton"," I knew this baby would come in handy."
"Plankton"," Turn on the navigation system, honey! Let's get this show on the road!"
"Plankton"," Heh, heh, heh, at this rate, we'll have the formula before you can say..."
"Plankton"," Barnacles! Now what?"
"Plankton"," Well, let's just dig deeper and go around it!"
"Plankton"," Shh! Can't you see I'm concentrating?  Yes! You see what happens when you let me make my own decisions? Now, maybe we'll get somewh-   What happened? "
"Plankton"," The majesty! I've never seen such beauty. "
"Plankton"," It's just a shame no one else can see it!"
"Plankton"," Karen, please! I'm trying to process my emotions! ...Karen! I think I know how to push Krabs out of business— we'll lure customers underground with this gorgeous scenery!"
"Plankton"," Man, I'm good!  Cave dwellers!  Back! That's better. From now on, you shall be my minions— servants to follow my every order! I decree this kingdom to be called the Chum Caverns! And may the people of Bikini Bottom shudder in awe of its Majesty! Ha, ha, ha, ha! "
"SpongeBob"," 2 orders of Chum Nuggets, please!"
"SpongeBob"," That certainly is chum! And such steamy chumminess deserves recompense!"
"Plankton"," Oh, I'll take that!  Eat your blackened, twisted, money-grubbing heart out, Krabs!  I'm even profiting off of your most loyal ally! I'm running out of space for this stuff! Got an empty safe I can borrow, Krabs?  But seriously, this is getting really heavy."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, isn't this place amazing?  Here are your Chum Nuggets, buddy. "
"Patrick"," Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your Chum Kebab! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, I guess you don't come down here for the food, anyways. You come down for the subterranean splendor of the Chum Caverns!"
"Patrick","  That, and the gift shop."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's right, Patrick! The gift shop! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, baby! I've got cavern fever!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Where have you been, and what is that ridiculous thing on your head?"
"SpongeBob"," It's a ""stalagmiter,"" available exclusively at the Chum Caverns Gift Shop."
"Mr. Krabs"," How dare you spend all the money I don't pay you at me arch-rival's business! Boy, Plankton's really cleaning up down there, which means it's time to start running into the ground."
"Plankton"," Another order of Chumballs!  Huh?"
"Plankton"," Krabs? What are you doing here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm here to steal back me customers, with the savory flavor of the Krabby Patty!  Now, go get it! "
"Plankton"," Krabs, you can't just slither down here and steal all my customers! It's unethical!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Unethical? This is perfectly legit! I call all building rights under my restaurant!"
"Plankton"," Sea turtles! He called it! He always was good with legal jargon.  Alright, Krabs, if you think it's fair to undercut my business, then I'm gonna undercut you! "
"Plankton"," Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak. Not well, I'd imagine. Now hold still so I can bury you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not if I bury you first! "
"Plankton"," Fine, Krabs, have it your way! "
"Mr. Krabs"," We're trapped! Trapped, I tell you!"
"Plankton"," This is all your fault! I oughta boil and butter you for this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton, I don't think you grasp the severity of our situation. We're trapped down here. As in, THERE IS NO WAY OUT!!!"
"Plankton"," Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me! My diminutive stature allows me to slip through rubble with ease. "
"Plankton"," I can't make it. We're doomed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-huh. That's what I've been trying to tell you.  Comfort me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aw, look at us! Old, gray..."
"Plankton"," ...Nearing the end..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Say, Plankton, say we get out of here without lives, let's agree to work together."
"Plankton"," You're right, Krabs. Let's bury the hatchet now and forever!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We have a deal. No more bickering."
"Plankton"," No more skulduggery of any kind. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hang on a minute, don't you hear that? "
"SpongeBob"," Surprise!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Woo-hoo! You found us! I oughta pay you for this!"
"SpongeBob"," Or, just pay me for the job I already do!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Plankton, we're free! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Where'd he go? "
"Plankton"," I'm way ahead of you, Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You better not be trying to steal me formula!"
"Plankton"," I am, and I will!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But what about our deal?"
"Plankton"," What? We're still working together, come on! You're helping me steal your formula! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it. Just wait 'till I get me claws on your... "
"Plankton"," Aha! Now time to get that formula! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Satisfied with yourself, Plankton! Now you've trapped us all underground!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Capturing customers! I should've thought of it sooner! But without Squidward, I need someone to work the register. "
"SpongeBob"," Order up Squidward!  I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today."
"Squidward","  Not in the least, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," OK, OK, I'll tell you."
"Squidward","  Your order, ma'am."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not using my hands because today is ""Work Without Your Hands Day"".  You should give it a whirl, buddy.  Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking. Just a minute please. Mr. Krabs, it's a Queen Amphitrite. She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh she does, does she? I'll handle this, laddie.  Yes, Queen Amphitrite.  Very convincing, but you're gonna have to call pretty early to fool ol' Eugene Krabs, PRANKSTER! . They think I was born yesterday. Aye-aye-aye. Does 700 work for you, your majesty?  Oil up yer spatula boy, for tonight you fry for a king."
"SpongeBob"," So much for ""Work Without Your Hands Day,"" SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability!  OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you."
"Mr. Krabs"," You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Now, what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?"
"SpongeBob"," All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive."
"Mr. Krabs"," 5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Leave it to your old boss here to capitalize on such a momentous occasion. "
"Mr. Krabs"," This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you..."
"Mr. Krabs"," See Neptune eat! Only five dollars! Only a few seats left!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir."
"SpongeBob"," Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I was sure there's somebody.. Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat."
"SpongeBob","  No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it."
"SpongeBob"," T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton?  Should I put it down yes or no?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So who's going to pay for these, then?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned  Triton."
"Squidward"," Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun."
"SpongeBob"," Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities."
"Squidward"," I do have a way with words."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!"
"SpongeBob","  Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, Krabs! Think, think!  Ooh! "
"Squidward"," Whatever it is, no."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, you're a man of culture."
"Squidward"," Go on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?"
"Squidward"," Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived."
"Squidward"," Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.' "
"SpongeBob"," What the—I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping."
"SpongeBob","  Another one!  Plus some rope. "
"SpongeBob","  Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations."
"SpongeBob"," For King Neptune's birthday!"
"SpongeBob","  You mean, you're King Neptune's son?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party."
"SpongeBob","  Well, thanks, but..."
"SpongeBob"," You're right. It just doesn't make any sense."
"SpongeBob"," I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't go."
"SpongeBob"," What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear"
"SpongeBob","  boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares  man that really is a tough nut to crack"
"SpongeBob"," Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street  yeah, I'll hurry "
"SpongeBob"," Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about, "
"Patrick"," Hmmm"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to..."
"Patrick","  Open!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast."
"Patrick"," I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces"
"SpongeBob"," Amazing!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Patrick"," Are you going to take us for a ride?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom."
"Patrick"," What an interesting man"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?"
"Squidward"," Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back."
"Mr. Krabs"," Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain."
"Squidward"," The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great idea, go and play them another song."
"Squidward"," If pleases the king, I would like to perform a..."
"Squidward"," What the?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What he say?"
"Squidward"," I think he wants us to look at the O MY!"
"SpongeBob"," What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?"
"Patrick"," Do you think Triton was in that cage for a reason."
"SpongeBob","  the Krusty Krab!"
"Patrick"," It's still standing."
"SpongeBob"," But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today."
"Patrick"," Right"
"SpongeBob"," We better use the secret entrance."
"SpongeBob"," Be very very quiet."
"Patrick"," Gotcha pall  What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Please! I'll be ruined!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this is terrible"
"Patrick"," Tell me about it, I never get free food here."
"Patrick"," He's unstoppable."
"SpongeBob"," Only as long as King Neptune is locked up."
"Patrick"," You thinking what I'm thinking?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them."
"Patrick"," Ah no, but I like your idea better!"
"SpongeBob"," Make ready the disguise."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, now! "
"SpongeBob"," Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us"
"Patrick"," You got it SpongeBob, scootch back a little.  Excuse me "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored"
"Patrick"," Don't rush me! Okay got it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?"
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me."
"Patrick"," Well SpongeBob that's..."
"Patrick"," Ahh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yes Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Do you think now's a good time to get those Triple Gooberry Sundays you where talking about?"
"SpongeBob"," I think now would be an excellent time, yes."
"Squidward"," All of the most intelligent programming starts before 5 AM. "
"Squidward"," No, no, no. Take your time. It's worth the wait."
"Squidward"," How sophisticated! "
"Squidward","  Oh, yeah, I haven't made the coffee yet.  Why in the world would they cancel ""Fab and Fancy?"" What could possibly be more enriching?  What?! "
"Squidward","  He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!"
"Squidward","  Where is my ""Fab and Fancy?!"""
"Squidward"," I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!"
"Squidward"," Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?"
"Squidward","  Really?"
"Squidward"," It's that easy?  Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access?  Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show!  Come on! Just a few more minutes, Squiddie, and it will be your turn to bask in the lime light! "
"SpongeBob"," Ohhh, yeah! Oh, lime light basking! Baskin' in the lime light!  Oh, good times. Good times.  So, where will said basking take place?"
"Squidward","  Like, I would tell you! Hmph...  Although, I've waited my whole life to have enough glory to rub it in someone's face. Anyone's face.  Even that face. Okay! I'll tell you, but the last thing I would want is for you to show up so plug your ears!  Well, I don't want to toot my own whistle, but... Wait, no! That's exactly what I mean to do!  Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Say again, Squidward? "
"Squidward","  Greetings. I'm Squidward Tentacles, your host of ""Squidward Chat"".   Today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing something near and dear to my heart, under-appreciated artists like myself. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's on TV?  Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward, you're on TV!  No, really, Squidward, come look!"
"Squidward"," I know I'm on TV! See the camera?  You're on TV too! "
"SpongeBob"," TV? "
"Squidward"," Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing..."
"Patrick"," Wow! "
"SpongeBob"," So I ran to tell Squidward that he was on TV and he told me that I was on TV and now you're on TV!"
"Patrick"," I'm on TV?! "
"Squidward"," This isn't happening!"
"Patrick"," I'm not on TV!  SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?"
"Squidward","  Patrick, just how dumb are you?"
"Patrick"," It varies."
"Squidward"," If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!"
"Patrick"," Ohhh. I get it!  Hi, TV people!  And my mouth is on TV! "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! You gotta try this! "
"Squidward"," Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera!  Would you get out of here?"
"Patrick","  Doubt it. "
"Squidward"," If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the camera man?"
"Patrick"," Camera man?"
"Squidward"," That means you take all the pretty pictures. "
"Patrick"," All right!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh ooh! Whoo! Whoo! Let me do something too, please?!"
"Squidward"," Fine. You can be the soundman. "
"SpongeBob","  Soundman..."
"Squidward"," Imbeciles!  Today, we're going to be talking about...  Why isn't the camera on me?  No! I'm the one talking!  I'm right here! Ahem! Today on Squidward Chat... we'll be discussing the under-appreciated arts.  Patrick, I'm down here!  As I was saying, today, we'll be...  Today... "
"Patrick","  Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! "
"Squidward","  Now then, I was going to tell you about my fabulous...  Sponge...! "
"SpongeBob"," It's heavy!  Thanks! But it itches. "
"Patrick","  I gotta go potty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward has his own TV show?"
"Squidward"," Well, you'll just have to hold it, Patrick! Now, if there are no more interruptions... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eat at the Krusty Krab, home of the original Krabby Patty!  And remember, we change our grease monthly!"
"Squidward"," Out! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! We don't want just you! We want your money too! "
"Sandy"," Whee, doggy! I can line-dance better than that!  Yee-haw!"
"Plankton"," Oh, please. I can cause far more collateral damage than that!  Karen, where'd you put my death ray?"
"Patrick","  My shorts are wet! "
"Plankton"," And eat at the Chum Bucket or perish! "
"Mr. Krabs"," The Krusty Krab! The Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!"
"Squidward","  Nooo! My show! "
"SpongeBob","  You seem tense. "
"Squidward","  Cut that out!  That's it! Everyone, out!  What do you think this is, huh? Some kind of housewarming?!"
"Squidward"," Get off my set! This is not working! "
"Squidward"," Me? "
"Squidward","  Keep it down! I'm trying to sleep! "
"Squidward"," The coast looks clear...  "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward!  "
"SpongeBob"," Today, I feel like doing some dancing!  "
"Squidward"," That's funny. Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh-ho, I got music, friend...  ...in my mind!  Oh, I love this song!  Here I go! "
"Squidward"," That is the stupidest dance move I've ever seen! "
"SpongeBob"," Who put you on the planet? Rueegh! "
"SpongeBob"," Your Krabby Patty, ma'am.  Now eat it, swallow it, and chew it down! "
"SpongeBob","  Really?  You like my dancin'? "
"SpongeBob","  Well, that's very nice of you to say. "
"Squidward"," Would you please stop dancing? "
"SpongeBob"," No, I can't stop dancin' now, Squidward. I have to practice for my big audition tomorrow! "
"Squidward"," You got a dance audition? "
"SpongeBob"," That's right!  So I gotta practice as much as I can before tomorrow.  Got a dance audition. "
"Squidward"," That idiot has a dance audition? He doesn't know the first thing about the subtle intricacies of dance!  Let him practice till he drops! He's never gonna get that part.  That's it! He'll just have to practice 'til he drops! When he does, I'll be there all leotarded up and ready to show my stuff!  Oh, SpongeBob! SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob... ...duh, I mean, uh... ... I suppose I could take you under my tutelage, you know, show you a few moves. "
"SpongeBob"," Under your tutelage, really? You mean it? "
"Squidward"," But, you must do exactly what I say. Got that? "
"SpongeBob","  I am dance-putty in your hands! "
"Squidward","  Hmm...  "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what are you doing, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," Oh, um, just a physical assessment I do with all of my new pupils.  Yeah, I'd say judging from the condition of those flabby ankles... "
"SpongeBob"," Flabby? "
"Squidward"," That's right. You need some physical conditioning before you ever set foot on a dance parquet. I want you to run to the top of Oyster Peak then back. {"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, anything to get rid of these flabby ankles of mine. "
"Squidward","  By the time that idiot gets back, he'll be too tired to dance! "
"Squidward","  What are you doing here? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm back from Mount Oyster!  Here.  Got this for you at the gift shop  "
"Squidward"," Fine!  Let's move on to our first dance lesson.  I want you to moonwalk on this treadmill while I read this entire novel!  "
"Squidward","  Huh? Huh? What, is he still at it?  Huh?  My treadmill! "
"SpongeBob"," You know, Squidward, exercising's fun and all, but when am I gonna learn some dancing? "
"Squidward"," All right! You wanna learn some dancing?! I'll show you dancing!  You know what gets people going? Ribbons!  "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!! "
"Squidward"," Now, do just as I did.  "
"SpongeBob"," Like this?  "
"SpongeBob"," Like that, Squidward?  "
"Squidward"," Okay, try this.  It's simple.  And a real showstopper.  Pay close attention.  Now you. "
"SpongeBob","  Gee, I don't know. Are you sure? "
"Squidward","  You want to ace the audition, don't you? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, yes, but-- "
"Squidward"," Then do it!  Enough! Listen, you pea-brain, we are gonna keep working on your routine until you get it right!  And I don't care how long it takes! Now, watch closely.  And a-one...  And a-two...  And aha!! You think you can handle that? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. "
"Squidward"," Then go and practice it, and don't stop until you've done exactly as I did. "
"SpongeBob","  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  No.  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  No. "
"Squidward"," Remember, don't stop till you've done it right.  "
"SpongeBob"," Right, Squidward.  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  Nope.  "
"Squidward","  Better go check on the little yellow sea-monkey's progress.  Well, SpongeBob, have you learned the moves? "
"SpongeBob","  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  "
"Squidward","  Aw, come on, now. After all I've done for you? We've got one day, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you're right. "
"Squidward","  Let's go, let's go! We're burning daylight.  "
"SpongeBob","  And a-one, and a-two, and a-oof!  Is that okay, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," I'm still not convinced.  Do it again.  "
"SpongeBob"," And a-one, and a-two...  "
"Squidward"," Good night, sweet prince, and hello, stardom for yours truly. "
"Squidward","  Only the best dancer in Bikini Bottom. "
"Squidward","  Observe a true master at work.  "
"Squidward"," Oh, baby, I knew it!  You won't be sorry you made this decision. "
"Squidward","  Squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squidawa! "
"SpongeBob","  I was up for that part. "
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--♪  Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'.  Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in."
"Mr. Krabs"," That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I could—"
"Mr. Krabs","  Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--"
"Mr. Krabs"," refrigerator."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy."
"Mr. Krabs","  Empty! "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh? Where?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hehehehehe! Peanuts!  What the...  These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff!  Jackpot.  Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl.  Don't worry Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles!  Bottom feeders.  Pearl! I brought you some--  cereal."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!  Food.  Not food.  Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge.  Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera. "
"Mr. Krabs"," S-sack?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be ""Santy Claws""  for the holidays."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks again, officer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I was afraid you were gonna say that."
"Mr. Krabs"," I wasn't stealing food!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See"
"SpongeBob"," Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn."
"Mr. Krabs","  G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect."
"Squidward"," Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas."
"SpongeBob"," But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house."
"Squidward"," I don't care. I'm calling the police. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, wait, you can't."
"Squidward"," Oh? And why is that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because if you do, I'll fire ya.  No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?"
"Squidward"," Hello, police?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it! I'll... I'll..."
"Squidward"," You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth."
"Squidward"," Neither did I."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," Pearl? What happened?"
"Mr. Krabs"," She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory."
"SpongeBob"," You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, hurry it up!"
"SpongeBob"," Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready."
"Mr. Krabs"," You've been saying that for the last-- "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love."
"Mr. Krabs","  Eh?"
"SpongeBob"," ♪La La La La La La La La! Getting Clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Ohhhh, what a delightful day it is...♪  Noooooo!  Good thing I have a spare!  I still have one more thing to clean.  Ohh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet!  And now I'm ready to go to work!  You've gotta be more careful, SquarePants!  Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... ... that! Oh, I saw ya. Not gonna fool me this time, soap.  This is not going well."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber duckie?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, is that it?"
"Patrick"," I found you! Duckie Duck!  Quack, quack, quack!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Huh..."
"SpongeBob"," I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here."
"Patrick"," What do you need, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean."
"Patrick"," Stuck? I can help with that.  There ya go, buddy! Now you're stuck forever!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee thanks, Patrick! Now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?!  Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck, not more stuck! How am I going to get to work if I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of Wringer! "
"Patrick","  There, is that better?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?"
"Patrick"," Okay, ya know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick"," And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion?  Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are ya, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame- broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, ""Hey! I can!"" I'm ready!"
"Patrick"," That's the spirit!"
"SpongeBob"," Woo!  Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!"
"Squidward"," It's about time.  Hey, SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!"
"SpongeBob","  Hardware store! No, from my bathroom."
"Squidward"," Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks, pal. "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh! Squidward!  Squidward!  Are you okay?"
"Squidward"," Please, just get away from me."
"SpongeBob"," Ohh! A refill! "
"SpongeBob","  Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Me money! What do you think yer doin'?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy... "
"SpongeBob"," Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help."
"Mr. Krabs","  Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, how was work?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack. "
"Patrick"," Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better."
"SpongeBob"," You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!"
"Patrick"," Dig in!"
"SpongeBob","  I can't even eat ice cream now?! This dumb wringer's in the way!"
"Patrick"," Bummer. Hey, ya know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean. "
"Patrick"," Look! The ball toss!"
"Patrick"," We wanna play!"
"Patrick"," Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Ohh! Ohh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know... I have too much eye pain."
"Patrick"," Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!"
"Patrick"," Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too!  Check it out!"
"SpongeBob"," That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy."
"Patrick"," Well, have some. It'll make you feel better."
"SpongeBob","  I said I don't want any! "
"Patrick"," You ruined my cotton candy!"
"SpongeBob"," Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!"
"SpongeBob"," I have never felt so ashamed."
"Patrick"," What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob"," If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!"
"Patrick"," I was only trying to help."
"SpongeBob","  Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today! "
"Patrick"," Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore! "
"SpongeBob"," Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one."
"Patrick","  Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard."
"Patrick"," Who asked you?!  Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?"
"SpongeBob","  My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head."
"Patrick"," Oh, man, he's too far gone."
"SpongeBob"," Not fit to live in society..."
"Patrick","  This is all my fault!  Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!"
"SpongeBob","  I guess crying does solve your problems after all.  Come here, buddy! "
"Patrick"," Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?"
"Plankton"," All the way from the bakery. But it will all be worth it when I finally get the Krabby Patty."
"Plankton"," Here we go..."
"Plankton"," Perfect, he's headed for the front door. Now it's time to make my exit."
"SpongeBob"," Here you go Sandy, a special patty for a special friend."
"Sandy"," Why, thanks SpongeBob. I sure am obliged. I love these things, but it's always a little tricky eating one. Pardon me. "
"Plankton"," Oh no! What's happening?"
"Plankton"," Eeeew!  No water! Can't breathe!"
"Sandy"," La da da da dee da da da da da dee..."
"Sandy"," Time to get this stinky thing off!"
"Sandy"," Whew! Boy, that's ripe."
"Sandy"," A-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo..."
"Plankton"," What's going on? Where am I?"
"Sandy"," ♪...A-doop-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo, scrub scrub scrub in the tub tub tub...♪"
"Plankton"," What in Neptune's ocean is that repulsive thing?!"
"Sandy"," Mm-mmm! Nothing like a hot shower to make a squirrel feel like a new woman!"
"Plankton"," Sandy Cheeks? But where's her fur?"
"Plankton"," Wow! Wait a minute, that's it! I think I found out how to get the Krabby Patty formula once and for all!"
"Sandy"," ♪Shoobie doop doo, shoobie doop doo... I'm getting clean... no fleas on me... gettin' clean...♪"
"Plankton"," Hope you like long showers, squirrel!"
"Plankton"," Our ticket to the Krabby Patty formula, that's what that is!"
"Plankton"," As serious as a shark attack."
"Sandy","  Aaaaaahhh! Now it's time to out my stinky fur coat!"
"Sandy","  What in tarnation!?"
"Sandy","  Maybe I left it outside..."
"Sandy","  I'm locked in!"
"Sandy","  Some low-life varmint stole my things and broke into my home! MY HOME! I'm gonna get that son of a guitar stringer!"
"Plankton"," Okay, Karen, wish me luck!"
"Plankton"," Heh heh. This is going to work like a charm."
"Plankton","  Watch where you're standin', coral brains!"
"Plankton","  No, Sandy is herself. No reason to be sus-pic-ious in any way, y'all."
"Plankton","  That was close. I gotta perfect that Texas drawl."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! You're back!"
"SpongeBob"," Say, Sandy. You look...different."
"Plankton"," Uh, what are y-y'all talkin' about, SpongeBob? It's your old pal, in the livin' fur."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but something about you is different...I just can't put my finger on it."
"Plankton","  Please don't put your finger on it."
"SpongeBob"," I got it! You're not wearing your spacesuit and helmet!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's get cookin'!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh, the gooey freshness that is the Krabby Patty patty."
"Plankton"," Lemme stop you there, SquarePants. I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties."
"SpongeBob"," Hohohoho. No can do, buddy. That would require revealing the secret formula. And that is explicitly forbidden as per my current labor contract."
"Plankton"," Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks.  Why, you and me are as closer 'n two catfish in a skillet."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, Sandy, 44-929b specifically prohibits the disclosure of the secret formula to friends, even when those friends are, quote, ""closer 'n two catfish in a skillet."""
"Plankton","  Curse you, Krabs...!"
"SpongeBob"," But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty. First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees."
"SpongeBob"," And we are guh-rillin'."
"Plankton"," An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?"
"SpongeBob"," A Krabby Patty is cooked for exactly 283 seconds on each side."
"Plankton","  283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm puttin' the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight."
"Plankton"," Yee-haw!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah... Anyway, I'm gonna leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o."
"SpongeBob","  You can always count on me, Mr. K."
"Plankton"," Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine."
"Sandy"," That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here. Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market. Well, not if I catch that varmint first."
"Sandy"," You! You seen anybody in these parts haulin' a fur pelt?"
"Sandy"," Chipmunk?! What is so funny about havin' my fur stole?"
"Sandy","  With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me comin' a mile away. I best find somethin' to cover my hind end."
"Sandy"," Time to go catch me some skunk!"
"SpongeBob"," Now that we're grillin', we can work on the fixin's! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed."
"Plankton"," Okay, I'll stand on thata' side for a better view."
"SpongeBob"," Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease."
"Plankton"," There it is."
"SpongeBob"," Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered....Always making sure to get both sides..."
"Plankton"," That's nice. That's interestin'."
"Plankton"," Almost there..."
"SpongeBob"," Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Plankton","  What, nothin'!"
"SpongeBob"," Remember, never overdry. Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks."
"Sandy"," That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts."
"SpongeBob"," Steady, steady... Nice. Oh, you're off-center by 3.6 millimeters. Mmmph, try it again, Sandy."
"Plankton","  Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!"
"SpongeBob"," Or, we could address your problem areas directly. Are you struggling with the final wrist flick? Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?"
"Plankton","  Gah!"
"Sandy"," I'm tired of running. Time to take a stand."
"Sandy"," It's not my fault! I..."
"Sandy"," I better go underground."
"Sandy"," What am I gonna do? If I'm ever gonna catch this thug, I'm gonna need some help."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, still off by that much. Try it again.  Ooh, try again  Mmm, try again.  Oh, try again.  Oh, try again."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, try again."
"Plankton","   Arrrgghh! You try it again! I'm makin' my move!"
"Plankton"," It's finally mine! Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Sandy! We can work this out!"
"Sandy"," My pelt!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr Krabs! Sandy's makin' off with the formula!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, you're naked! And you don't have any clothes on!"
"Sandy"," Unhand my pelt, you unknown varmint!"
"Plankton"," Only from my cold, dead feelers!"
"Sandy"," PLANKTON! I should have known this was your doin'! Now feel this!"
"Sandy"," Hi-ya!"
"Sandy"," Pwaaaaa!"
"Sandy"," Gotcha! And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself."
"Plankton"," My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, thank you Sandy. Thank you Sandy."
"Sandy"," Uh, sure, Mr. Krabs. "
"Sandy"," Cops! Thank goodness you've come.  Take this sicko away!"
"Plankton"," Eh, that's the life."
"Plankton"," Hey, I was watching that!"
"Plankton"," It is not! Business is just slow."
"Plankton"," You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here."
"Plankton"," Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?"
"Plankton"," Really?"
"Plankton"," Your tour?"
"Plankton"," Groan."
"Plankton"," You're right. I'm such a failure."
"Plankton"," Yes."
"Plankton"," Yes."
"Plankton"," Right. Why didn't I think of that before?"
"Plankton"," Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!"
"Plankton"," Mmph!"
"Plankton"," And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?"
"Plankton"," No! Wait!"
"Plankton"," There he is!  Get out of the way! This is it!  Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where do you want this life-size cutout of you, Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton"," No! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work."
"Plankton"," Ugh. great."
"Plankton"," Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!"
"Squidward"," I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up."
"Plankton","  It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, can somebody hit the lights?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, is that you? Oh, it's so dark in here. I can't see a thing."
"Squidward"," Can you just get the Krabby Patty?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing Squidward. One Krabby Patty coming up!"
"Plankton"," Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, nuh-uh. Nuh, no. Ah, there you are, patty! Add one fluffy bun like so and a squirt of special sauce ."
"Plankton"," Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?"
"SpongeBob"," Then you grab yourself some lettuce.  And voilà! One perfect Krabby Patty! I only wish I could see how beautiful it looks. Number 17, your patty is ready. Whoa. Watch your step, Squidward. It is pitch black out here."
"Squidward"," Don't know, don't want to."
"SpongeBob"," Order number 17. Order number 17? Order 17? Order 17."
"Plankton"," That's it! I'm going somewhere else.  Where are those ear drums? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, the lights are back on.  Mr. Krabs! Help me, Mr. Krabs. I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties. Please tell me the secret recipe again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time."
"Plankton"," Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm."
"Mr. Krabs"," The secret of the Krabby Patty formula. Jackpot!"
"Plankton"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I said, could you speak a little louder, please?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on."
"Plankton"," Here it comes."
"Mr. Krabs","  The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!"
"Plankton","  Ow! I hate my life!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it, uh-- you know, I don't remember. Me neither. So we good?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"Plankton"," Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, the brain!  Honk!  Ugh!  Hi, friend. Why am I making idiotic comments?  Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot--  Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper.  Ugh.  Where am I?"
"Plankton"," Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets?  Nope.  Doesn't this kid have any secrets Aha!  The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets.   In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. ""Sounds that make Squidward upset""?"
"Plankton"," ""Patrick's favorite places to be scratched""?"
"Squidward"," What are you doing? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, uh, scratching!"
"Plankton"," Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this?  The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy.  Ugh. Uh.  The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is!  My mouth is watering.  My taste buds are tingling. Mm, mm. oh, yeah. It feels so good. I can feel it all the way to my finger....stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine!  Hwuh. Okay, that was weird. Like I was saying, the Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab. Hwuh. Who said that?! What's happening to me?  It's all warm and fuzzy! It's ---  It's ---  It's beautiful!  All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony."
"Plankton"," I sure did."
"Plankton"," Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?"
"Plankton"," The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab."
"Patrick"," Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?"
"Patrick"," Oh, well. Never mind. "
"Plankton"," The What?"
"Plankton"," Louse what up?"
"Squidward","  And would you have kelp fries with that?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, order...  ...up."
"SpongeBob","  One double Krabby Patty with everything on it, one order of kelp fries, one...  Squidward, what size of kelp fries are these?"
"Squidward"," Medium."
"SpongeBob"," Comin' right up! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward! What's all the hubberub?  SpongeBob! What's all the hubberub?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh.. I'm not sure Mr. Krabs. I was bringing the customer's order, and then I slipped and fell in this grease slick. I think I may be hurt real bad."
"Mr. Krabs"," Grease slick, eeh? "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... what is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That me boy, is a grease trap."
"SpongeBob"," Kinda looks like nobody has cleaned out the trap for awhile."
"SpongeBob"," Yea!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs. Can I see that? Saw this in a movie once.  mmm... Yeah maybe i wasn't doing it right.  Oh never mind! I was.  Yeah.. Nothing like a long night siphoning grease to put some hair on your chest, Eh? Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Well Now we got the ol' grease trap cleaned out, what do you think we should do with all this excess grease?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm."
"Mr. Krabs"," Right behind there.  Alright. Let's get out of here! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, are you sure that was... legal?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, legal."
"Plankton","  Wyaagh!  What the?  This is the most bizarre precipitation I've ever slipped and fallen in.  Eeeaugh! It reeks!  But it tastes delicious!  Darn it, I almost had an idea!  Oh, I do. I do have an idea! !"
"Plankton"," Coming dear."
"Mr. Krabs"," Somethin' is terribly wrong, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," And it's taken you this long to figure that out?"
"Squidward"," So?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So I'm gonna go find  out what that rascal's up to!  Excuse me! Excuse me! Comin' through!  What the?  Try Plankton's... new delicerous... Chummy Patties... now with edible flavor?  Clearly somethin' crabby is goin' on here."
"Plankton","  Next Chumstomer, please.  Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!"
"Plankton"," Sorry to disappoint, Krabs, but I've done no such thing. I'm simply using a gift somebody left me to make my chum taste good."
"Mr. Krabs"," A gift?"
"Plankton"," Sheh! It's almost like I got a personal visit from the Flavor Fairy!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Be that as it may, Plankton! It takes 2 to tango."
"Plankton"," Wha?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!"
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, I'm not doing anything!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Never mind that now, I've got some new directions for yeh. From now on, I want you to fry up  two Patties for every Krabby Patty we sell!  One for the patty itself, and the  second, just for the grease! Then,  slather the grease from the second patty onto the first one and  Voalora! It's A deluxe Krabby Patty with extra flavor! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, do you think it might be kinda... unhealthy to be feeding people all this grease?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Unhealthy? Boy, didn't anybody tell yeh?"
"SpongeBob"," Tell me what, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Questions are a danger to you...  and a burden to others. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Lil' lower! Lil' more! More! Lil' more! Okay, A little to the left now! Up a bit! Okay wait, that's too far. Alright, alright, perfect, right there!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, I hope whatever you're yelling about is something more important than my mid-morning nap!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just hangin' a new sign, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Deluxe Krabby Patties.  Juuust what the world needed."
"Mr. Krabs"," Shh! Okay, a little higher now!"
"Plankton"," Next Chumstomer in line, please!  Hello? "
"Plankton","  Well, well, well, now I do see what Krabs meant when he said two could play that game. But he's a bigger fool than he realizes if he thinks old Plankton it gonna take this one lying down!  Uhhh... Meh"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quadruple goodness?!  We'll see about that.  Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay Mr. Krabs. I never turn the grill off but I can turn it off even less than that if you want."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh... I already see the...  Whoa!  Gribbets Mollusk!  Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour. "
"Plankton"," Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation."
"Plankton"," You're right! And it's packed with flavor!"
"Squidward"," P.U, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!"
"Squidward"," I'll give you points for honesty."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!"
"SpongeBob"," It was supposed to be going to table 3."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Sir yes sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, Mr. Krabs, I've been thinking. And well, don't you think maybe this whole grease thing has gone a bit to far? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work! "
"Patrick"," Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities... "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Oh no! Not my best friend too! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!"
"Plankton"," Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?"
"SpongeBob"," It was me sir. I just wanted to tell you that... Well, for the past two weeks, Plankton and Mr. Krabs have been...  they've been feeding people grea... "
"SpongeBob"," They're feeding people grease."
"Plankton"," Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm,  this was all his idea! All of it!"
"Plankton"," Well I'm taking a bath. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I guess this is it boy. The end of an era."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not the end, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," It is. Unless I can find a way to get this grease soaked up. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute. Did you say soaked up?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh what difference does it make?"
"SpongeBob","  You'll see!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah. It was all a dream! "
"SpongeBob"," No it wasn't, Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly. The Krusty Krab is grease free!  Patrick No! "
"Patrick"," Mmm. Crunchity Munchities!"
"SpongeBob"," Stop it! Stop it! Go away! No! No! "
"SpongeBob"," You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place.  Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words.  Now to attack these floors!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!"
"SpongeBob","  Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And he's been with me for such a long time now."
"SpongeBob","  I am."
"Mr. Krabs"," But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today."
"SpongeBob"," Yep, he's gonna have to--   What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or  Squidward!  Phew! I am taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!"
"Squidward","  No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. "
"Squidward"," What do you think you're doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy...  ...and it looks like it is you!"
"Squidward"," No, I'm not! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait!  We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! "
"Squidward","  I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa!  Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts.  Face the facts that I'm the little guy!  And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today."
"Squidward","  Krabs is letting you go today?  As in I won't have to work with you ever again. "
"SpongeBob","  Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go.  Gotten too big for his cage.  Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's the use, Gary?  I've lost the will to go on!   Hi, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again."
"SpongeBob","  What happened to yours?"
"Patrick"," Nothing, it's just empty."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator."
"Patrick"," Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, or Gary,  or for anybody!"
"Patrick","  Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else."
"Patrick","  I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when I'm looking for a job.  Kick back, watch some TV,  and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage! "
"SpongeBob","  Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds.  Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones.  Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. Bank Teller Needed. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking.  20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97.  Order up!   What do you think, boss?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick.  I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, ""This is a job for a sponge."" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?"
"Patrick"," Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy."
"SpongeBob"," That's just a billboard, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Why don't you get a job as a billboard?"
"SpongeBob"," I...don't think that's physically possible,  but I could audition to be a sponge model."
"Patrick"," Fine, do it your way."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent."
"Patrick"," Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?"
"Patrick"," Why don't you find out?"
"SpongeBob","  Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. "
"Patrick"," No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. This is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries!   My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well, want is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it.  I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  I did?"
"SpongeBob","  Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?  ♪ Laaa! ♪  Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, getting on it.  ♪ When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim! ♪"
"SpongeBob","  How'd I do?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess a sponge can make it in this town.  I am going to be a star! "
"SpongeBob"," Fantastic. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes I did, Patrick.  I said, ""You're looking at the new face of television."""
"Patrick"," All right!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep."
"Patrick"," Yeah, beauty sleep!"
"SpongeBob"," That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up."
"Mr. Krabs","  Afternoon, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What was that about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. "
"SpongeBob"," A star's first day is his most important."
"SpongeBob"," Yippee!  I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's happening?!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?"
"SpongeBob"," Nooo!  I can't do this!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ever so gently..."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs!  Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better.  Please."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, what are you going on about?!"
"SpongeBob","  I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya on one condition. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!"
"Squidward"," Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!"
"SpongeBob"," Good morning Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Ignoring, ignoring!  Chewing gum!? That's disgusting!  Oh c'mon!  People who litter really bug me!  Litterbugs  Litterbugs!"
"Squidward","  Bugs... litter... litter... bugs"
"Squidward"," Yes I did, and I like to complain!"
"Squidward"," What? No! no no, I just stepped in it!"
"Squidward"," Bikini Bottom P.D Ticket for littering. Penalty Community service?!"
"Squidward"," Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug!  Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!"
"Squidward","  Can things get any worse?"
"Squidward"," Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!"
"Squidward"," No! I... um... er... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause."
"Squidward","  Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!"
"Squidward"," Squilliam thinks he sooo amazing!  Phew!  Hmmm,I've gotta find some place to dump this litter.  Oh oh oh! Perfect!  Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this... "
"Squidward"," What? No!"
"Squidward"," Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man!  Help."
"SpongeBob"," I'll help you Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Why are you in a trash bag?"
"SpongeBob"," I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty  tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy.  I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," No thank you! I'll do it myself."
"SpongeBob"," Please let me help!"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Please?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Pretty please?"
"Squidward"," No way!"
"SpongeBob"," Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?"
"Squidward"," Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi lady!"
"SpongeBob"," Can I help you now?"
"Squidward"," Alright! Fine! You can help me."
"SpongeBob"," Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Thank you Squidward."
"Squidward"," Well... you gonna help me!?"
"SpongeBob"," First, close your eyeees!"
"Squidward"," Why?"
"SpongeBob"," C'mon!"
"Squidward"," Fine!  Now what?"
"SpongeBob"," No peeking."
"Squidward"," Oh brother."
"SpongeBob"," Ok! You can open your eyes now!"
"Squidward"," Oh this is so stuuuuuu...  ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?"
"SpongeBob","  I put it in..."
"Squidward"," Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks SpongeBob I hate you a little less now."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward that... that's a beautiful thing to say!"
"Squidward"," Well I don't know how you did it but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time!  My house!"
"Squidward"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," I am angry? Squidward why are you angry?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob. what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," Your garbage."
"Squidward"," Where's my house?"
"SpongeBob"," On top of your garbage.  The dump was closed.  So I bought it here."
"Squidward","  How?"
"SpongeBob"," Like this.  Do you wanna try? "
"Squidward"," Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth,this is the least annoying. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward... "
"Squidward"," Wait! Zip it! I have an idea!  Here stand in this.  See ya sucker! "
"Squidward"," Neptune no!"
"Squidward"," They were gonna make a statue of me! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh a statue eh? Hey Squidward! Look! "
"Squidward"," What is that?!"
"SpongeBob"," Your very own statue!"
"Squidward"," Really?!  Garbage. I'm made of garbage"
"SpongeBob"," You sure are!"
"Squidward"," Hhhhhha! Thanks SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, Gare I'll get out of your hair, buddy.  See you later Gare.  Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, but I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get to the old job. You just have to stay here alone by yourself. But I promise as soon as I'm done at work we'll play... together. Okay.......Love you Gare-bear. "
"SpongeBob"," Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru...  Sorry sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh?  Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price.  SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties. "
"SpongeBob"," Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay.  Too distraught to even answer the phone."
"SpongeBob"," My outgoing message is a lie.  Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up..."
"SpongeBob"," Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well well well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever."
"SpongeBob"," Really Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot."
"SpongeBob"," You're the best, Mr. Krabs!  Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," Mayhap if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work."
"SpongeBob","  They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah this is the one. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," I've brought you a surprise.  Your very own play pal.  His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other I'll be right back."
"SpongeBob"," Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happen to your matters? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here you.  There you are, Fluffy. Now eat up I'm gonna go make my enchiladas."
"SpongeBob"," Done!  Oh, enchiladas are hot hot hot!  Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends.  Why don't you two play a little?  Great, now my enchiladas are cold."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, what has gone into you, huh?!  Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend and you have ruined my enchiladas dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight.  I hope you're happy now."
"SpongeBob"," Good. Because you can sleep with your new friend.  Aww, look at you two so cute together!"
"SpongeBob"," I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Shame on you!  Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless.  See there he is fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please?  Good night. "
"SpongeBob","  Mmmmm. You're making meatballs, Grandma? Time for dinner already? "
"SpongeBob","  Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along!  Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. WHOA!!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right Gary, you have let me no choice! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!  You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary!  Bad! Bad! Bad, boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad!  I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy?  What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt."
"SpongeBob"," This is exactly what I was talking about..."
"SpongeBob","  Fluffy! Fluffy, wait!  Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, this is more like it. From now on I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?"
"SpongeBob","  It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so?  Serve em' up, snail! "
"Squidward"," Can I help you?"
"Patrick"," Yeah.  Let's see here. I have a question about the Krabby Kiddy meal. Is it really, really, really cute?"
"Squidward"," Adorable."
"Patrick"," Cuter than a regular Krabby Patty?"
"SpongeBob"," Psssssst. Patrick, get the Krabby Kiddy Meal. Look,  a regular Krabby Patty here, , a Krabby Kiddy Patty here. 30% cuter. And it only costs one dollar more."
"Patrick","  Oh yah! Yah! Yah! I want that!"
"Squidward"," That'll be $4.99."
"Patrick"," Is this enough? "
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, crud! That's everything I got! ."
"SpongeBob"," I have an idea. We can buy it together and share it."
"Patrick","  Share it?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. You see, sharing is the most wonderful..."
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Patrick"," I'm familiar with the concept of ""sharing""."
"Patrick"," Sharing is fun.  Huh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Aren't you gonna save some of that for me?"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing."
"Patrick"," Hey!  Where's the toy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it doesn't come with a toy."
"Patrick"," What!? That's a rip off! I want my money back!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Money back?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's the problem here?"
"Patrick"," My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm. And you'd like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys."
"SpongeBob"," An officially ""licensed"" Krusty Krab toy? ."
"SpongeBob","  My purpose in life is to have you as my toy. ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eww.  Disgusting. Ahem. Yep it's pretty special all right. And it can be yours for only..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, good looking."
"SpongeBob","  I love you officially licensed Krabby Patty toy. Not too formal. I think I'll call you, oh, Patty Pal!"
"Patrick"," Am I interrupting?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Patrick. Have you met my new toy?"
"Patrick"," Don't you mean ""our"" new toy?"
"SpongeBob"," Our new toy?"
"Patrick"," It came from the meal that we're ""sharing."""
"SpongeBob"," Sharing?"
"Patrick"," Remember?  Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden  Remember those words, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal.  Now can I see it again Patrick? "
"Patrick"," I thought we were sharing it?"
"SpongeBob"," When's my turn?"
"Patrick"," Aren't you supposed to be working? "
"SpongeBob","  Of course."
"SpongeBob"," Now is it my turn?"
"Patrick"," No."
"SpongeBob"," How about now?"
"Patrick"," Uh, maybe tomorrow."
"SpongeBob","  Nighty-night, Patty Pal. "
"Patrick"," NO TOUCHING!!! See you tomorrow  Say goodnight Patty Pal  Goodnight, SpongeBob "
"SpongeBob","  Goodnight.  Poor Patrick. He's only got the Patty Pal for tonight, and he'll be asleep, and won't get to play with it at all! "
"SpongeBob"," Yes! Today's my Patty Pal day! Oh, this is going to be fun!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, of course, Patrick will give me my turn with the Patty Pal!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, you can be a real negative nancy! "
"SpongeBob"," I heard that!  Good Morning, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Uh, I'm not home right now! Please leave a message! Beeeep!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, it's me! SpongeBob! It's my turn to play with the toy!"
"Patrick"," I can't go out! I just washed my hair!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't have any h- come out Patrick! It's my turn!!"
"Patrick","  Got any ID?"
"SpongeBob","  I have my milkshake dispenser operator license"
"Patrick"," Looks fake to me, pal! Bye-Bye now!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess I had best be going!  I'm walking away. Here I go.  I'm gone now! "
"Patrick"," You sure?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sure!  Hi, Patrick! Time to share!"
"Patrick"," Deceiver! You didn't leave at all!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and you were washing your hair?!"
"Patrick"," I was too, see?  Nice dismount!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm working out!"
"Patrick"," Well, gotta go! "
"SpongeBob"," Hold on, buster! Hand over the toy! It's my turn!"
"Patrick"," I can't! Patty Pal and me have really bonded!"
"SpongeBob","  Gary was so right about you! You're a non-sharer!"
"Patrick"," Gary said that? You're off my friend list, Gary!!"
"SpongeBob"," Hand it over, Patrick! I get to play with the Patty Pal today! "
"Patrick"," You can't take it! It's not fair! "
"SpongeBob"," How about I take it for half a day?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mm!"
"SpongeBob"," How about we trade off every hour?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mm!"
"SpongeBob"," Every half hour?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mm!"
"SpongeBob"," Every fifteen minutes?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mm!"
"SpongeBob"," Five minutes?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mm!"
"SpongeBob"," One minute?"
"Patrick"," N-n-no!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay then my final offer, we trade off every second!"
"Patrick"," One."
"SpongeBob"," One."
"Patrick"," One."
"Squidward"," I hate them."
"Sandy"," Howdy, Patrick, SpongeBob."
"Sandy"," What in tarnation's going on with you two?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick won't share OUR toy."
"Sandy"," What you need is a mediator. Y'all best sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other.  So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now."
"SpongeBob"," Water?!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy."
"SpongeBob"," That mediator lady make some good points."
"Patrick"," Most definitely."
"SpongeBob"," It takes understanding."
"Patrick"," Communication is key."
"SpongeBob"," It's my turn!"
"Patrick"," No, it's mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Mine!"
"Patrick"," If I can't have it, no one can!"
"SpongeBob"," NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Avast, there, laddies. What's all this ruckerus about now?"
"SpongeBob"," It's our Krabby Patty toy Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so that I couldn't play with it."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob won't let me play with it."
"SpongeBob"," Only because you hogged it all night."
"Patrick"," I did not!"
"SpongeBob"," Did too!"
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh you, toy eater!"
"Patrick"," Tattletale!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa whoa whoa, there, now, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinket between youse. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I gave each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you're in luck! You two seem so thrilled with the toy. I had an entire case of 'em made. They've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each."
"Patrick"," This time, it's on me. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's my money."
"Patrick"," Have you learned nothing about sharing?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries."
"SpongeBob"," And..."
"Squidward"," Please."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?"
"Squidward"," Yes. Yes it was."
"SpongeBob","  One large sea fries coming up!   Eeeeeee! "
"Squidward"," One large sea fries. Extra weird."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!  Report to me office."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now listen up, son. I called ye here on the official Krusty Krab business. Every year, me fellow cheapskate crabs meet and discuss new ways of being stinky in the workplace. But more than that, they bestow the award for Cheapest Krab. And this year,  I've been nominated!"
"SpongeBob"," ...Krabs......nominated......award...award?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So I'll be outta town for the awards ceremony. And yer coming with me."
"SpongeBob"," Road... trip!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, this trip... I'm gonna teach ye all the cheapskate knowledge like you were the son I've never wanted!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Can I call you Daddy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Pa?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Pop?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Papa?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," My old man?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Daddy-kins?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe."
"SpongeBob"," Grampy Joe?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh! No! Now, this'll be a great learning experience for you, so keep yer brain peeled!"
"SpongeBob","  Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Attention cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp!  Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Chintzy McGee?!"
"SpongeBob"," Good luck, Mr. Krabs- "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate  He wants a tip."
"SpongeBob","  What's a tip?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It means he wants money for nothing.  So watch closely.  There ye are, lad."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, thank you!  Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Go ahead! Give it a try!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, sir!  Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny-  quarter. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Go on boy! The quarter's getting away!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win! "
"SpongeBob"," My quarter! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hi, fellers! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers."
"SpongeBob"," I cook Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money. "
"SpongeBob"," Twenty five, twenty six- "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's mangle."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you, thank you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year!  I'm gonna need your help on this one! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'...  Ye not getting it, are ye?  Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er."
"SpongeBob","  You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?"
"SpongeBob"," No. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win! "
"SpongeBob","  Um, uh, ugh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red."
"Mr. Krabs","  Exaggerate!"
"SpongeBob"," Blue!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! About me being cheap!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees.  Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent."
"Mr. Krabs","  Thanks. "
"SpongeBob"," Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries!  And let's not forget these hotel towels! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But...but isn't that stealing?"
"SpongeBob"," Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh heh. Well, could we ""exaggerate"" this pillow, too?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, only if you help me ""exaggerate"" this air conditioner!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, boy! But why not ""exaggerate"" the whole wall?  Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew. "
"SpongeBob"," Duh!  Exaggerated! "
"Mr. Krabs","   Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob me boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. "
"SpongeBob"," Oops. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'm bored."
"Patrick"," Hmmm... Interesting. Me too! Let's go look for something to do in Old Man Squidward's shed!"
"SpongeBob"," Old Man Squidward's shed?!"
"Patrick","  Yyyeeeeeep!"
"Patrick"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick."
"Squidward"," Ahh. La-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo! "
"SpongeBob"," It's Old Man Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Hide!"
"Squidward","  Where's my trowl?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Is this a trowl? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick!"
"Squidward"," Oh, here it is.  "
"SpongeBob"," Don't hurt us, Squidward!"
"Patrick"," We're bored!"
"SpongeBob"," We just wanted to play with your...  ...whatever this thing is."
"Squidward"," No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You morons would probably...  You want to play with my lawnmower?"
"Squidward"," Hmmm... "
"SpongeBob","  Thanks for letting us mow your lawn, Squidward!  Ahhh! My patty flipping hand! "
"Squidward","  Knock yourselves out!"
"SpongeBob"," You're not The Flying Dutchman!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, The Flying Dutchman has a beard!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger!"
"Patrick"," Your beard will just grow back."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts."
"Patrick"," Ghostified? That's not even a real word."
"Patrick","  We're mermaids!"
"SpongeBob","  We're ghosts!  Yaayyy!"
"SpongeBob"," It's SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts!  Ooohhhh!"
"SpongeBob"," We're going to haunt you! Foreeever!  Oooooohhh—!  Well, that killed the mood. "
"Squidward"," I knew I shouldn't have lent them my lawnmower."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Patrick. Being a ghost can sure tire ya out!"
"Patrick"," Good night, ghost buddy!"
"SpongeBob","  That's odd. However shall I get in?  That's handy!  I am beat! Well, I don't have to take the stairs!  Ah. ."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick. I didn't sleep so good last night."
"Patrick"," I didn't sleep at all. I can see through my eyelids.  My eyelids!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm late for work!"
"Patrick","  My eyelids..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'm here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're late! Why are you bright green, and what happened to your legs?"
"Squidward"," He's a ghost, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," A ghost, eh? Can you still cook Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, old living employeer! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ewww."
"SpongeBob","  La la la la!  I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," I don't either. I can't even eat anything! Food just goes right through me! "
"Patrick"," Maybe the weird hairless man will change us back?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Let's go see The Flying Dutchman!"
"SpongeBob"," Please, Mr. Dutchman, we can't take it! Constantly moaning and groaning!"
"Patrick"," Invisible to the world!"
"SpongeBob","  Living without a soul!"
"Patrick","  It's miserable!"
"SpongeBob","  How could anyone live like this?! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey. We're still ghosts."
"SpongeBob"," But we want to be normal, now!"
"SpongeBob"," We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?"
"Patrick"," And you can't go on your date because you're ugly?"
"Patrick"," I don't get it..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, here we are several months later! I wonder how the Flying Dutchman's doing on his date!"
"Squidward"," Ahh.. What a day!"
"SpongeBob"," Good morning Krusty Krab!  Oh.. Sorry Squidward! Didn't see ya there!"
"Squidward","  Not a problem SpongeBob, not a problem at all!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Specials? We don't have specials! "
"Squidward"," Good morning sir! Welcome to the Krusty Krab."
"Squidward"," 1 Krabby Patty coming up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, you're in a chipper mood this morning, did you get an order of fancy decorative soaps in the mail or somethin'?"
"Squidward"," Even better, I have a clarinet recital immediately after work today! So ain't nothing gonna ruin my day."
"Squidward"," No need! See? Not a drop!"
"Squidward","  Grr.. I can't take this any more!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I told you, there's no early-bird special, now stop calling me here-- Mother!"
"Squidward"," This is unacceptable!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Squidward"," This! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice to have ya back Squidward."
"Squidward"," This is an outrage! I no longer tolerate my personal items being soiled by the ravels that crawls in this restaurant! I demand a place to put my stuff!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm.. Okay, uhhh. I suppose you could put it with the nacho cheese, no one's got near that in years."
"Squidward"," You ever read this? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eewww! Gross!  Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives!"
"Squidward"," It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property."
"Mr. Krabs"," Gahh! Blast you Squidward! You drive a hard bargain. I guess I could rustle something up for ya."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah... Sizzle those juices."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Here we go! Found it!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, what is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's me old navy locker. Good as new! "
"SpongeBob"," Who is that Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  uuhh.. Appears to be Corporal Sterling, lad. Heh...forgot all about that prank.  Squidward! Your locker is ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Do we share our lockers like we share hairnets?"
"Squidward"," Not at a whale's age."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now not so fast, Mr. Squidward, the law requires that all employees have a secure place for personal items. So you are required by law, to share."
"Squidward"," Ohh, I suppose I can share but only since it requires by law. Hey! This thing is filthy! You don't expect me to clean it?!"
"SpongeBob","  No he doesn't! And I don't either!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Blimey! She hasn't sparkled like this since boot camp! Carry on boys."
"Squidward"," Impressive indeed. Just keep your grubby little hands to your side."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squidward. Finally I have a clean place to store my toothbrush."
"Squidward"," Just don't touch my clarinet!"
"SpongeBob"," I promise nothing untoward will happen."
"Squidward"," Order up, SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be fry cooking. I told you not to touch my stuff!"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't! I wore protective gloves! And besides, don't you like how classy it look now?"
"Squidward"," Velvet.."
"SpongeBob"," Now I'd like to stand by and idly chat with you, Squidward, But I must attend to my Krusty Krab duties! In the future, please keep your interruptions to a minimum sir, please!"
"Squidward"," And here's your change, mam."
"Squidward"," What is that idiot doing now?! "
"Squidward"," I hope you're not trying to shove the boxes into that locker!"
"SpongeBob"," Too late! it's already done."
"Squidward"," If you smashed my clarinet-- so help me, Neptune-- I will "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Squidward there's plenty of room!"
"SpongeBob"," I... expanded a bit."
"Squidward"," Well it's all fine and dandy, but where's my clarinet?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's simple"
"SpongeBob"," We just simply consult the card catalog and find.. Squidward's Clarinet drawer 36●8-B "
"SpongeBob"," See?"
"Squidward"," Fine. but remember, It's vitally important that nothing happens to it"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry buddy! "
"SpongeBob"," You're in good hands."
"Squidward"," What's he doing?!"
"Squidward"," Alright what do you want? "
"Squidward"," Yeah, Just a bit of a... renovation. "
"Squidward","  My clarinet! SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," There. 36●8-B"
"SpongeBob"," Item has temporarily moved during reconstruction. Relocated to shelf 1018●2-E."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?!"
"Squidward"," 1018●2-E."
"Squidward"," Another note?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oops! Did I say 1018●2-E? I meant 2019●3-F! Sorry!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, Wait!"
"Squidward"," What have you done to my- "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob I do not play games."
"Squidward","  Where am I? What is this place?"
"Squidward"," Hey, come back! I need my clarinet! Come Back! Where are you? Sponge-"
"Squidward"," uuhh.. I'm.. trying to find my clarinet."
"Squidward"," Yes, my clarinet! Which I am the proud owner."
"Squidward"," You calling me a liar?!"
"Squidward"," I'm sorry I-I-I didn't mean to offend you."
"Squidward","  I've learned..  I've learned respect..."
"Squidward"," Stand still you idiot!"
"Squidward"," I got you now!"
"Squidward"," ha ha! Wha the- SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!"
"Patrick"," I win! I win!"
"Patrick"," Hey.. What are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," You tell me what in the wide world of sports is this place? And how did you get so big?"
"Patrick"," Must be all the pressure."
"Squidward"," What are talking about?"
"Patrick"," It must be... The pressure."
"Patrick"," I gotta get outta here!"
"Squidward"," Where are you going you imbecile?!"
"Squidward"," Almost... Gotcha!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I just sweet talked an old lady out of $20 for a Krabby Patty! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, are you okay?"
"Squidward","  -Such a nightmare!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you trying to say buddy?"
"Squidward","  I tried to get my clarinet in there...  Impossible!"
"SpongeBob"," Clari-- Oh! You mean this! "
"Squidward"," Where did you get that?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, with all the ruckus you were making over it, I kept it with me, Just to make sure it was safe."
"Squidward"," Grrr..."
"SpongeBob"," Call it a friendly gesture!"
"Squidward"," I'll show you a friendly gesture! Do you know the horror I've endured?!  Let's see how you like it! "
"Squidward"," Ahh!"
"Squidward"," Yes, yes I am; as a matter of fact, you wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get- "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward! You wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get here."
"Squidward","  "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm.. I was just going to bring his clarinet."
"SpongeBob","  Just two more minutes, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Yup!"
"SpongeBob"," Look! Here he comes! "
"Patrick"," Who?"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Mr. Ranger."
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks. "
"SpongeBob"," Aren't you forgetting something?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, something."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot."
"Patrick"," Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, guess what?"
"Patrick"," You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, yes, how did you guess?"
"Patrick"," Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself."
"SpongeBob"," Let's just start with the song."
"Patrick"," You mean ""The Jellyfishing Song""?"
"SpongeBob"," That's the one."
"Patrick"," ♪I jellyfish all da' night!♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪I jellyfish all da' afternoon,♪"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?"
"Patrick"," You bet! And it's highway convenient, too, according to that big sign!"
"SpongeBob","  Big sign? I didn't see a big sig-Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!"
"Patrick","  It says, ""Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."""
"SpongeBob","  Superhighway!!!!!???? Do you know what this means??!!"
"Patrick"," Well, its sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-"
"SpongeBob"," I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel--ds, uh, sorry."
"Patrick"," So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single specie of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, but yeah, something like that  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, ""Shelly Super Highway,"" from ever being built!"
"SpongeBob"," Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!"
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway!  Hmmm."
"Squidward"," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now."
"SpongeBob"," Too busy doing what?"
"Squidward"," I'm too busy telling you, ""No!"" "
"Mr. Krabs"," Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!"
"SpongeBob","  Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, SpongeBob, That's not your usual four-fingered salute."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?"
"SpongeBob"," Really, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, why?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see fo yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!"
"SpongeBob","  Charts and dia- Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?  After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Gee, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it does a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What!!?? Who approved this plan!!??"
"SpongeBob","  ""Plan approved by & sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"""
"Mr. Krabs","  C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!"
"SpongeBob","  Think this piece will get the point across?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!"
"Plankton"," I can't."
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!"
"Plankton"," I really can't come outside!"
"SpongeBob"," Why not!?"
"Plankton","  Because I'm already outside, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes for cryin' out loud!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, sorry."
"Plankton"," Now what's this all about, anyway?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking."
"Plankton"," All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop."
"SpongeBob"," Not that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? You've been what?"
"SpongeBob"," We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute. You've been what?"
"Plankton"," Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know."
"Plankton"," Forget it. Even if I wanted to the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible."
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Plankton"," Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback."
"Mr. Krabs"," And I like saying, ""aye."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, why did I say ""aye""?"
"Plankton"," Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!"
"SpongeBob"," What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds lie on me back and sob loudly."
"SpongeBob"," Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!"
"Patrick"," I, couldn't tell you."
"SpongeBob","  It means, you hate tambourines?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and-"
"SpongeBob"," What for?"
"SpongeBob","  But, my grandma gave me this sitar! It didn't come with a license."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm scared!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-Uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march."
"SpongeBob"," What was that?"
"Patrick"," Oh, it's when a bunch of people go walkin' on a street, an-"
"SpongeBob","  I know what a freedom march is, Patrick! I mean, what did he say?"
"Patrick"," Oh, . He said, ""Let not your heart walk away from you, lest your mind grow legs and follow it."""
"SpongeBob","  Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened after he was arrested?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, because no one one ever heard from him again. "
"SpongeBob"," See you later!"
"Patrick","  It's a wig!"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the lift!"
"SpongeBob","  They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!"
"Patrick"," Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere! "
"SpongeBob","  Well, at least it ain't raining!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm not ready to give up just yet!"
"Patrick","  I am!"
"SpongeBob"," If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!"
"Patrick"," You mean like a parade?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?"
"Patrick","  There's one going by right there. [shows two fish with a banner saying ""Shelly Super Highway""; followed by a marching band; followed by a float and the circus; followed by Santa on a tropical island on a limo; followed by a herd of senior citizens being whipped at by the two wrestlers from Krusty Krushers; followed by a group of Scottish fish playing bagpipes; followed by some clown fish and a cat parade balloon; followed by a choir; and finally followed by a heavy metal rock band."
"SpongeBob"," That certainly is a parade!"
"Patrick","  Look!"
"SpongeBob","  Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Does this?! "
"SpongeBob"," C'mon! Let's go follow them! "
"Plankton","  People of Bikini Bottom- Today marks the new- STOP MURMURING!!  Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new-   Shut up!  As I was saying, today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom!  Now, its time to pave our way down the road to success!  Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah, baby!  Hey, you there! are you trying to get yourself crushed!?"
"SpongeBob","  I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first! "
"Plankton","  Well, then; Your wish is my command, Sponge! "
"SpongeBob","  Is that all you got? "
"SpongeBob","  Knock it off, Patrick."
"Mr. Krabs","  I used to dream of me restaurant with ""easy highway access!"""
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, but this is more like ""highway excess!"""
"Squidward","  Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles.  It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!"
"Mr. Krabs","  But Squidward, you can't leave! What if we have, a customer?"
"Squidward","  Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, actually, Squidward, it's called a super-highway."
"Squidward","  I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!"
"SpongeBob","  But Squidward- "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, SpongeBob. Squidward's right.  It's high time we started accepting facts. "
"SpongeBob","  I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, boyo! Not that kind!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?"
"Mr. Krabs","  The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this."
"SpongeBob"," It can't?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob. And its time to activate Plan Zed-9er9er."
"SpongeBob"," Zed-9er9er!!!??? "
"Squidward"," Eugene, what is Zed-9er9er!!?? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plan Zed-9er9er is, I'm- I'm- I'm selling the Krabby Patty secret formula to Plantkon!"
"Squidward","  Eugene!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene. "
"SpongeBob"," Tell me I'm dreaming! "
"Squidward","  Not this time, little fella. "
"Plankton"," Uh lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it!  Now who could that be during my hour of triumph?  How appropriate. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton, I'm ready to negoitiate a price for me secret formula."
"Plankton"," Oh sure!  Let me just wind my watch!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What for?"
"Plankton","  Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this!  Did you hear that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Plankton"," Karen, is that you??"
"Mr. Krabs","  Up there!  Whoa, nelly!!!"
"SpongeBob","  First, I lost Jellyfish fields, and- and......"
"Squidward"," And what?"
"SpongeBob","  And now I lost the only job I ever wanted! "
"Squidward"," Look on the bright side, at least I don't have to put up with you anymore! Ha,ha! This could be the start of something beautiful! OW! What the-!"
"SpongeBob"," Look! All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think they're here to trade gift baskets!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, ya don't?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You know something, Plankton? Maybe we can talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life."
"Plankton","  Wait! I'm coming with you!  No!  Not the eye! Not the eye!!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah! Now they'll have to listen! "
"SpongeBob"," Well okay, I guess, sorry I am a little nervous."
"SpongeBob"," Well all I have to say is that um, well,  Stop the madness! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat so they will be in peace. So what do you say everybody, will you help me?"
"SpongeBob","  You're kidding, right?"
"SpongeBob"," All right everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to Bikini Bottom since those 99 cent stores."
"Plankton"," Good effort, SpongeFool, but you can't destroy my highway, it's indestructable!"
"SpongeBob"," Larry Lobster!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy Squirrel! "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff! "
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Su-Su-Su-Super!"
"SpongeBob"," And Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Still harder!"
"Plankton"," Wait! I didn't count on all of you working together! "
"Plankton"," My highway! Stop, you can't do this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Praise Neptune."
"SpongeBob"," Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jelly fishing song!"
"SpongeBob"," Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy Jellyfishing, I can’t wait! Can you Patrick?  Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Did you say something?"
"SpongeBob"," I said...  Ow!"
"Patrick"," I’m sure how to respond to that."
"SpongeBob","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey heroes! Is there anything we can do?  So is that it?"
"Patrick","  Well I lost a quarter."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Guess what came in the mail today!"
"Patrick"," Oh! What?! "
"SpongeBob"," This... "
"Patrick"," Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy lost episode! Stick it in! "
"Patrick"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae! "
"Patrick"," I Can't watch! "
"SpongeBob"," Look out, Mermaid Man!"
"Patrick"," Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?"
"SpongeBob"," Those are called ""End Credits,"" Patrick."
"Patrick"," End credits? But I don't want it to end!"
"SpongeBob"," That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button! "
"Patrick"," Thank you Neptune! "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, day!  Oww!  I stubbed my toe!  I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe!  D'oh, that was my favorite shirt. "
"SpongeBob"," That's a sad song!"
"Squidward","  That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me I get to work with him all day. "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, guess what?  Yeah, I'll come back later. "
"SpongeBob"," He was a good little Krabby Patty.  I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I----I came to love him!  It just isn't fair! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!"
"SpongeBob"," But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—"
"Squidward"," Krabby Patty nothing!  KRABBY PATTY NOTHING!!!  What now?"
"SpongeBob","  You yelled at me! YOU YELLED AT ME! "
"Squidward"," All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 200 yet, you have cried 43 times."
"SpongeBob"," And you wrote that number on a chalkboard."
"Squidward"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Squidward","  I have no idea."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain."
"Squidward"," Au contraire. "
"SpongeBob"," What's this?"
"Squidward"," It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years."
"SpongeBob","  Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore."
"Squidward"," Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying."
"SpongeBob","  Excuse me a minute. "
"Patrick","  Star... residence. Patrick speaking."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy! Is it 730 already?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm still at work."
"Patrick"," How can I help you?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?"
"Patrick","  Well, of course you can."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, great, thanks Patrick."
"Patrick"," Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah.  Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there."
"SpongeBob","  Okay."
"Patrick"," Yeah, talk to you later."
"SpongeBob"," All right, see ya.  Okay, it's a bet."
"Squidward","  Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to...  Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year."
"SpongeBob"," Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?"
"Squidward"," Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth.  No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward."
"Squidward"," There's a first time for everything.  Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible. "
"SpongeBob","  I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry.  I can do this."
"Squidward","  Do what?  Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob.  Isn't that beautiful?"
"SpongeBob"," I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset."
"Squidward"," Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?"
"SpongeBob","  It's... "
"Squidward"," Is that a tear I see? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well, sunset's over.  Nice of you to drop in, neighbor."
"Squidward"," Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping."
"SpongeBob","  Aww. He looks like an angel."
"Squidward"," That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah.  No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Yes?"
"Squidward"," Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away."
"SpongeBob","  Mother, father?"
"Squidward","  ""Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much."
"SpongeBob","  Ohh.  My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?"
"Squidward","  No problem."
"Squidward"," Ooh, let's turn it up."
"SpongeBob","  Hooray!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, no."
"SpongeBob","  What, what, what?"
"SpongeBob","  Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?"
"Squidward"," Fine!"
"SpongeBob","  You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain."
"Patrick","  Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob.  I'm gonna watch it all night! "
"Squidward"," It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns.  Oh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What would you say to a little music? "
"SpongeBob","  I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments. "
"Squidward"," Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting. "", then chuckles]"
"SpongeBob","  You said something, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I just said, ""Relax and enjoy the song."" "
"SpongeBob"," That's a really sad song, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You're not gonna cry though, are you?"
"SpongeBob"," No.  Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed. "
"Squidward","  Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," How about a bedtime story?"
"SpongeBob"," Now you're talking!  Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Umm...  How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?"
"SpongeBob"," That sounds like a very sad story."
"Squidward"," Oh, very sad. Umm... ""There once was a little angler  who was, uh, little and sad.  One day the little sad angler was walking through the park. "
"SpongeBob"," Walking..."
"Squidward"," But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry.  He cried and he cried. And he cried even more.  And he kept crying...  ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it."
"SpongeBob"," I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel-- Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on!  ...four, three, two, one!  Midnight!  Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the... "
"Patrick"," Wow, what a great show."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, at least we're still together, little ones."
"SpongeBob","  More popcorn, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," No, no. No, no. Please."
"SpongeBob","  Don't be shy now. I made extra.  That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mrs. Puff? "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff!?"
"SpongeBob"," I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff? "
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?"
"SpongeBob"," Help!"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It would be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if this information were to leak out to the authorities."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry! I think we can work something out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Err... interesting, No, I had something else in mind. Surprise, SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff! "
"Mr. Krabs"," She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?"
"Mr. Krabs"," She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close."
"SpongeBob"," It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?"
"SpongeBob"," So what do you think?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It certainly has. Now SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! I get to show you the ropes Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now."
"SpongeBob"," Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?"
"SpongeBob"," Eager to get behind the wheel, eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember Good Grades."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh yes! The total key is a bit sticky so you're gonna have to be forceful but not too forceful. Get it?"
"SpongeBob"," You did! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm? "
"SpongeBob","  Good day ma lady, charmed, I'm sure."
"SpongeBob","  Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day."
"SpongeBob"," Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as ""duke."""
"SpongeBob"," Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just don't let it happen again, Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity."
"SpongeBob","  One Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P, look out for the barrel!"
"SpongeBob"," Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although I have to deduct points for that landing though."
"SpongeBob"," Don't forget to read the note!"
"SpongeBob"," Good day class! "
"SpongeBob"," Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob.  Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahh, that's the stuff.  Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive."
"Mr. Krabs"," Explosive!? "
"Plankton"," Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!"
"Plankton"," You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ready for instant?  Fire!  Take cover!  Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up another dud, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Another dud huh? "
"Plankton"," No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well you ain't getting it."
"Plankton"," Well I constrict you to reconsider. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, go jump off a plank."
"Plankton"," Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need where is the formula Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha ha ha ha!"
"Plankton"," Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs?  OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal."
"SpongeBob"," I'll never talk."
"Plankton"," Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that."
"SpongeBob"," OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!"
"Plankton"," Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Errrrrrrr..."
"Plankton","  Say what am I smelling? you got something burning?"
"SpongeBob","  Smells like blubber to me."
"Plankton"," Bl bl blubber?"
"Plankton"," Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!"
"Mr. Krabs"," She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today."
"Plankton"," Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! "
"Plankton","  Don't say it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap."
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. . Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's even better! It's the money Mr. Krabs pays me with.  Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!"
"Mr. Krabs","  It's all catching up to me...  Please, Pearl?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers."
"Plankton"," "
"Plankton"," Krabs had a whale!"
"Plankton"," I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?"
"Plankton","  That should keep her out!"
"Plankton"," Holy, protozoa!  Karen! she's here! She got in!"
"Plankton"," There's a whale in the laboratory!"
"Plankton"," See for yourself!"
"Plankton"," I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!"
"Plankton"," Karen! Karen--!"
"Plankton"," Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. "
"Plankton","  Hey! Get me out of here! "
"Plankton"," Grand-Dad?"
"Plankton"," Gastric acid?  No!  I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! "
"Plankton","  What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 415 bus should be here any time now."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?"
"Plankton"," Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature."
"Plankton"," Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself."
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Goodbye, Pipsqueak!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really? He's a mess! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?"
"Mr. Krabs"," May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?"
"SpongeBob"," No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this."
"Plankton","  Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Plankton."
"Plankton"," What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab."
"Plankton"," What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... "
"Plankton"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of."
"Plankton"," You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottom feeder!"
"SpongeBob"," But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?"
"Plankton"," No, of course not."
"SpongeBob"," Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!"
"Plankton"," No, no. Thank you! "
"Mr. Krabs"," This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!"
"Plankton"," Oh, is that so."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!"
"Plankton"," You don't scare me, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs."
"Plankton"," The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?"
"Plankton"," See for yourself.  Enjoy the show! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!"
"Plankton"," Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug."
"Plankton"," Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. "
"Plankton","  Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy!  Okay, you're beginning to creep me out."
"SpongeBob"," Do you know what today is little guy?"
"SpongeBob"," It's take Gary a walk in a park day!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this great Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down here for a sec. [falls asleep with the two owners. Gary sees the two other snails on the swing feeling bored then he sees one snail about to climb up the ladder where the slide is next to and falls down bored, and Gary sees the seasaw where a little snail named 'Mary' is on. Gary's eyes turn into hearts and slithers to the other side of the seasaw. Mary sees Gary who is falling in love with her."
"SpongeBob"," Say good-bye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I'll just wip you up some dinner! "
"SpongeBob"," Mmm-mmm seaweed noodle stew. "
"SpongeBob","  Bon appetit, Gary, I made it with extra love.  Well it's not exacily what I had in mind but knock yourself out. "
"SpongeBob"," One, two. One, two.  Oh. There you are. That sure is a knock out dinner, ey?"
"SpongeBob"," Come on Gary, it's time for beddy bye!  Night night, Gare-Bare. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Gary!  Hmm? He's not here. Oh. Right. He's probably playing with the litter box again.  Peek-a-boo!  Hmm? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  Hmph. I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself.  Huh? What's this? Is this some kind of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My pet Gary has been snailnapped by a deranged snail-lover!  Don't worry Gare-Bare, I'll save you! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy?  Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's.  Now for the true test.  Uh-hun. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary?! "
"SpongeBob","  Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary you snailnapper!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just as though he can jump into your car."
"SpongeBob"," Not now Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?"
"SpongeBob"," You did wander out of the house on your own? But why?  Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashion to Mary! "
"SpongeBob"," That's gotta hurt, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Don't stay out too late, Gary!  They grow up so fast."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's not at his post!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm! There's something missing. Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, I'm Squidward. Welcome to the Krusty Krab where we never leave our post."
"SpongeBob"," And how may I help you on this fine day?"
"Squidward"," Hey! It's hard to get my beauty sleep when people keep dropping junk on my head."
"Squidward"," Hooray! Yahoo!"
"Squidward"," WHOOPEE! Ha ha ha! Whoopee! Woo-"
"SpongeBob"," PEE!"
"Squidward"," Whoo-"
"SpongeBob"," Pee."
"Squidward"," Whoop..."
"SpongeBob"," PEE!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Avast, there. What are you all happy about?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm on my happy break, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You, I'm used to. Why is he so happy?"
"Squidward"," I'm holding a package from famous producer Buddy Barracuda. I sent him my play and now, he's gonna produce it!"
"Squidward"," I quit."
"Squidward"," So long, losers!"
"Squidward"," Let's see here. Ahem. Oh, yeah."
"Squidward"," ""Thank you for submitting your play, entitled 'Squidward Strokes of Genius'. Your work speaks volumes about you as an artist, a person, and a member of society."""
"Squidward"," So it is with great pleasure that we announce we will not be doing your play."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Squidward! You're back from your amazing success as a playwriter!"
"SpongeBob"," And your shirt, is that a cotton-poly blend? Faaancy!"
"SpongeBob"," And just look at your stylish new hairdo."
"SpongeBob"," Say, is that a copy of your play? Oh, my goodness! Are you going to put on your amazing play in our little old Krusty Krab? Oh, you are a true patron of the arts, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Well, I suppose that could work. If people see my play, they'll recognize my genius! And I'll become famous and-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Me customers come here for greasy food at high prices. Not for singin' and dancin'."
"Squidward"," But my play doesn't have singing-"
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, people pay to eat, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course."
"SpongeBob"," And they would pay to watch a play, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Um, I suppose..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if they eat and watch a play, you can charge twice as much!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Really? How about four times as much?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't see why not!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...OK. But only on one condition that you both keep workin'. Because if just one Krabby Patty is late, I'm shuttin' you down!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm. Now what will we call this eating dinner and watching theater?"
"Squidward"," Dinner theater?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you. Oh, sure."
"SpongeBob"," No. Come on, let's get serious. We need a title that sounds...dramatic! Got it! We'll call it ""Singy Eaty Time!"""
"Squidward"," But SpongeBob, there's no singing in my-"
"Mr. Krabs"," I love it!"
"Squidward"," Wow! Look at all these aspiring actors wanting to take part in my genius!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And all of them willin' to work for no pay!"
"SpongeBob"," Did I get the part?"
"Squidward"," You got all the parts."
"Squidward"," And we let him handle our food?"
"Squidward"," It's time!"
"Squidward"," Places, people, places!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Please take your seats."
"Squidward"," Dim the house lights."
"Squidward"," Bring up the stage lights!"
"Squidward"," Raise the curtain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," How much am I gettin' for this?"
"Squidward"," Onto this world, an octopus was born. A cephalopod with promise and potential."
"Squidward"," Go away, go away, shoo, shoo, go away, go away."
"Mr. Krabs"," What did I tell you? You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!"
"Squidward"," Fine."
"Squidward"," He had promise until he came to work here, at the Krusty Krab. Serving local morons heart-stopping, artery-clogging garbage, masquerading as food."
"Squidward"," At the Krusty Krab, his talent was wasted."
"Squidward"," No, you ca-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward..."
"Squidward"," Sigh...Yes, you can."
"Squidward"," But, who will refill the empty chasm in my soul?"
"Squidward"," His life shattered. Is there any task too demeaning for our hero?"
"Squidward"," It would appear not. No ketchup! That's terrible! Here, let me help you with that."
"Squidward"," Would any of you want this job?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! You get that customer a fresh patty with ketchup! Now! And don't forget to charge him again!"
"Squidward"," And then, there's my skinflint boss."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Umm, Mr. Krabs, I'm acting."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, that's OK, then. But get him a Krabby Patty!"
"Squidward"," Fine. SpongeBob! One Krabby Patty with ketchup! And now, we come to the worst part of my job...working with him."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Um, ahem, ah...I...uh...I forgot my lines!"
"Squidward"," You don't have any lines!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't?"
"Squidward"," D'oh! Just stand there and act like...yourself!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I can do that! Ahem! One Krabby Patty coming up!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, what is this. A stray wrapper in my kitchen."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, the trash is full. I had better call...the garbage truck."
"Squidward","  Talent."
"Squidward","  Outstanding. Thank you, that'll do. Ahem. But, lo and behold-"
"Squidward"," His genius was unrecognized."
"Squidward","  Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored. Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved. But worst of all...underpaid."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's funny, 'cause it's true!"
"Squidward"," And furthermore!"
"Squidward","  Unfulfilled. In a word, his myriad of talents were,  wasted."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! You still haven't given me customers their Krabby Patties!"
"Squidward"," All right! SpongeBob, where's that Patty?!"
"SpongeBob"," What have I done? Have I let the lure of theatre production get between me and my patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, forgive me. I let the glamour of the stage distract me from my true calling Making sure that every patty I prepare is the best it can be."
"Squidward"," Uh huh."
"SpongeBob"," No, Squidward, no. Those patties aren't fit for public consumption."
"Squidward"," Here! Enjoy!"
"Squidward"," Oh, puh-leeze. You wouldn't know quality if it hit you in the face!"
"Squidward"," D'oh! I said if it hit YOU in the face!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung. Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you."
"SpongeBob"," Bless you all."
"Patrick"," I like throwing food."
"Mr. Krabs"," And for you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Certainly."
"Squidward"," Oh boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good news. The play is such a success, I've added two more shows and a matinee! Break a leg tomorrow!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, wow!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," You are the best starer I’ve ever stared at!"
"Patrick"," Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing."
"SpongeBob","  Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something?  Oh!  Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!  Oh, it’s not opening!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help. "
"SpongeBob"," How to open things. Brilliant, Patrick! I saw the movie, but I never read the book."
"Patrick"," Uh, ok.  Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandy’s door! Twist to the left."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I was twisting to the right."
"Patrick"," A common mistake, my good friend.  Allow me.  Ok, time to open this."
"Sandy","  Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah!  Well, you’re still no match for my squirrel-fu!  It’s a letter from my twin brother, Randy!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh!"
"Sandy","  Do you mind?"
"SpongeBob"," Not at all. Read on."
"Patrick"," Doesn’t bother me."
"Sandy"," Get out of my suit!  Well, golly! Randy says the rodeo’s come to town. I’ve got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!"
"SpongeBob"," Championship title? For what?"
"Sandy"," You got cotton in your ears?"
"Patrick","  Hmm, no. It’s not cotton. It’s actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty.  Mmm."
"SpongeBob","  Is your championship title for jellyfishing?"
"Sandy"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Karate? "
"Sandy"," No!"
"SpongeBob","  Perhaps the science fair, then."
"Sandy"," No. It’s my rodeo championship on the line."
"SpongeBob"," Rodeo? What does rodeo mean?"
"Sandy"," ♪Critters that you gotta wrangle.♪  ♪Cowboy suits with perty spangles.♪  ♪Boots with spurs that jingle jangle, that's a rodeo. Tight blue jeans you gotta squeeze in, but they sure look mighty pleasin'!♪  ♪Big belt buckles are always in season!♪  ♪That's a rodeo.♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo♪"
"Sandy","  ♪Ride that critter, don’t be no quitter! Hold on tight with all your might! Yee-haw! That’s a rodeo. Tractor pulls and big old bulls.♪  ♪Line dancin’, horses prancin’!♪  ♪Barrel racin’, bareback ridin’!♪  ♪Bronco bustin’,  aluminium sidin’.♪  ♪That’s a rodeo.♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo!♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo!♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo!♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo!♪"
"Sandy"," ♪And don’t forget who makes us laugh when we’re feelin’ down. The happy slappy, sunny, funny good ol’ rodeo clown.♪ "
"SpongeBob"," Clowns?  Don’t go, Sandy! It’s too risky!"
"Sandy","  I must! It’s my duty! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this is terrible! We can’t let Sandy go all alone! It’s too dangerous up there, right Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Eh, I’m indifferent."
"SpongeBob"," How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we weren’t there to help? Why, I wouldn’t be able to look at myself."
"Patrick"," Look at yourself? How do you do that? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!"
"Patrick","  No more tight jeans!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I’m sure someone else will help me."
"SpongeBob"," So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesn’t have to do with money. Uh-huh, that’s what I thought. "
"SpongeBob","  I need to find someone with compassion. Someone who selflessly helps others, with no concern for his own safety. I need…A hero."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward! Sandy is in terrible trouble. You’ve got to help me save her!"
"Squidward"," Oh, no! Sally’s in trouble!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Sandy."
"Squidward"," Don’t worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here.  I’ll get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!"
"SpongeBob"," Right-o, Mr. Tentacles, sir!"
"Squidward"," Just don’t panic! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh uh. Well, there’s one last person I can ask."
"SpongeBob","  Plankton!"
"Plankton","  What?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy’s in trouble. I need help rescuing her."
"Plankton","  I’m kind of busy right now."
"SpongeBob"," Jeepers, it’ll only take a minute."
"Plankton"," Yea, uh I’d love to help, but I really got to go.  Ouch."
"SpongeBob"," Ugh. Well, I’m going to go save Sandy, whether anyone wants to help or not."
"SpongeBob","  I guess it’s just you and me, Gary.  Let’s go. Gary the snail! Do you plan on staying here while Sandy is possibly in trouble somewhere up there?"
"SpongeBob"," She’s the squirrel."
"SpongeBob"," No, brown. Gary, what does that have to do  You too, huh? Well, we’ll see about that! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Eh, pudding."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! What’s the meaning of this?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy’s in trouble, and I need all of your help to save her from the horrors of the rodeo! There are clowns there!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, the next time you ‘invite’ me to one of your slumber parties, I’m calling the cops!   Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh. Yes, Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Where the devil are we?"
"SpongeBob"," It's... Texas."
"SpongeBob"," What’s that, boy? You see Sandy?"
"SpongeBob"," And she’s…riding a bullfrog?"
"Sandy","  Yee-haw!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Sandy"," Ow. Gall darn it! You sea slickers made me lose the rodeo. Why are you here, anyways?"
"SpongeBob"," To help save you from this rodeo thing!  You need to get out of here! "
"Sandy"," I don’t need to be saved!  Watch out! That old bullfrog’s got a flea on his flanks, and he’s comin’ right at ya!"
"Patrick"," Did we save Sandy?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. We didn’t."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did we make any money?"
"Sandy"," Aw, cactus! That ol’ bullfrog’s got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy!  Next time, leave the rodeos to me."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, nuts. "
"Plankton"," Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!"
"Plankton"," You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child."
"Plankton"," Uh, no, chocolate. Open up!  You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me.  There you are. There you are, darling."
"Plankton"," Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender..."
"Plankton"," I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! Now, where were we?  Grandma, don't forget your teeth."
"Plankton"," Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there.  That's perfect!  PERFECT!  Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say ""No"" to a helpless little grandma!  Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodness, no!  Here you are."
"Plankton"," Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there.  '"
"SpongeBob"," La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la!  Yay!! A DIRECT HIT!  Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, prepare to dive! Repeat prepare to di--  Hi, lady!  "
"Plankton","  Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?"
"SpongeBob"," Ehh, not really..."
"Plankton"," It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!"
"SpongeBob","  Quick, come inside!  Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?"
"Plankton"," I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is...  I mean..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm so glad you came back...  ...Double-Great Grammyma.  You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy.  Okay, lean forward.  There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have.  How about we look through some old family photo albums?  Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage.  Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma? "
"Plankton"," It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance."
"SpongeBob"," Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too...  ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first."
"Plankton"," Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. "
"SpongeBob"," Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?                                                                              "
"Plankton"," Huh?!? Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...!  Holy mother of Neptune, it's true."
"SpongeBob"," Good mooorning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!"
"Plankton"," Uh, sounds delightful.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. "
"SpongeBob"," So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?"
"Plankton"," Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmmm... "
"Plankton"," I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is...  I mean..."
"SpongeBob","  No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting."
"Plankton"," Well, uh..."
"SpongeBob","  Come on, it'll be fun!  Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?"
"Plankton"," Why, yes!  HOW CAN YOU DRINK THIS DRECK?!  Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, ""More, please.""  "
"SpongeBob"," Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?"
"Plankton"," Nope. "
"SpongeBob"," Why are you not having fun?"
"Plankton"," Why?! BECAUSE I DON'T KNIT, YOU NITWIT!  "
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf.  Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta ""masta""!  Grandma, you getting bored?"
"Plankton"," No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I COULD EAT A VILLAGE!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?"
"Plankton","  Would I?  Uh, yeah, I would.  Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?"
"Plankton"," Antenna... What?! No, I...!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and...  ...Squidward!"
"Plankton"," AAAH!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch."
"Squidward"," Your what?"
"SpongeBob"," My great-grammyma!  She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy."
"Squidward"," Right...  SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. "
"SpongeBob"," Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry."
"Plankton"," Never mind. Just get me into the kitchen! "
"SpongeBob","  Well, here it is."
"Plankton"," AT LAST!"
"SpongeBob"," Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties."
"Plankton"," Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything."
"SpongeBob"," Ha, ha, ha... What?"
"Plankton"," Nothing, go ahead!  Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I...  Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dishwashing while I have the chance.  The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink.  Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma!  Oh, I can't bear to look!  Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!"
"SpongeBob"," Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?"
"Plankton"," Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there."
"Plankton"," Why would he?"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later."
"Plankton"," Oh, I feel better already. "
"SpongeBob"," Sweet dreams, Grammyma. "
"Plankton"," Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr. Krabs! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...!  I'm just going to savour this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel TRULY ALIVE! "
"Plankton"," B-But-But-But I...  Grandma, I can... "
"Plankton"," Grandma, I can explain!"
"SpongeBob"," Grandma?  You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done....  Wow. This town is sure going downhill.  Uhh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...you know...unwinding. Enjoying the free parking.   What's happening to your little critter here?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change."
"Mr. Krabs"," Change? As in legal tender?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. Watch. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle."
"SpongeBob"," You mean snail."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you, SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye?"
"SpongeBob"," You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace."
"Mr. Krabs"," But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent."
"SpongeBob"," But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him."
"Mr. Krabs"," I could."
"Mr. Krabs"," There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!"
"SpongeBob"," What's so funny, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh...SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster?"
"SpongeBob"," Done and done!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak."
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Anything on the floor gains. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets!  Ahh. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya?!  Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways."
"SpongeBob"," Close up! Come on, Gar. You're coming with me."
"Mr. Krabs"," You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet.  Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw."
"SpongeBob"," Gary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, heh. Excuse me mam."
"Mr. Krabs","  Dirty money spends just like the clean. "
"SpongeBob"," I've finished greasing the fryer. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You sure make easy work."
"SpongeBob"," Try telling that to my frizzled hands. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, but you still have work to do."
"SpongeBob"," I do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest?"
"SpongeBob"," But aren't they the same size."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look."
"SpongeBob"," Will do, captain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," You okay, boy? "
"Mr. Krabs"," That a boy."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs is right. Some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well, I better get to work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!"
"Mr. Krabs"," If you don't get moving I'm gonna'..."
"SpongeBob"," You're gonna' do what sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat. "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, okay. The rivets are all rearranged."
"Mr. Krabs"," What!? How is that possible? Uhh, now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. That's easy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, uh, uh, but I want you to do it with this toothbrush. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Bye old pal."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sure he is. Bye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry? Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hee, hee, hee, hee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming.  Hey, what's the big ide-er? We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's like taking candy from a baby!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh oh. Pronto. Time for plan B! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah ha! That should do it!  Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he needs me to do anymore impossible jobs."
"SpongeBob"," Pardon me sir. You haven't seen a crab walking around with a snail, have you?"
"SpongeBob"," His sneagle?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr, arr, arr, arr."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs. What have you done to my Gary? So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr, arr, arr, arr. How's it going boyo? Are you feeling the coin vibes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean you don't feel so good?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You look fine to me. Now stop being such a baby and make me some money. Excuse me, pregnant lady coming through!  Uh, he he. Hoo boy. It--it's sure hard being preggers!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh!  "
"Mr. Krabs","  Get ready for it now, boy me boy!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Thank you for your money!  Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! For shame!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off."
"SpongeBob"," Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I got nothing of the soul.  I would never steal. You have to quit making up stories, boy-yo."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not making up anything! I know all about your little scheme! You're the one making up stories!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you have work you should be doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's rich!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!"
"SpongeBob"," That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why you little yellow... Well, I never..."
"SpongeBob"," You never what? Learned to use decent language? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who do you think you are!  Jackpot! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy."
"SpongeBob"," Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, my Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fridge magnet!"
"SpongeBob"," Cause' it's a magnet! That's it, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well, what do ya' know?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Oh, I can't afford this."
"Mr. Krabs"," Noooooooooooooooo!"
"Patrick"," Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection.  It's a little land that's all mine.  Now it's snowing in my little land.  It's snowing again.  Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake.  Must have been an aftershock.  Uh, hey, no wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See? "
"Patrick"," Snow globes are always funny.  Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go."
"SpongeBob","  Dinnertime, Gary. And it's your favorite flavor—crushed anemone byproducts and krill.  What is that horrific banging?  Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!"
"Patrick"," Hey, hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he's crying out for help."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, this is even worse than yesterday."
"Squidward"," Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares."
"Mr. Krabs"," That would be me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, try telling that guy over there. "
"SpongeBob"," No! Why?! Why?! Why?!  Why?!  It was horrible.  Patrick! Patrick! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten."
"Patrick"," Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him."
"SpongeBob"," I would be delighted to meet him."
"Patrick"," Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me."
"Patrick"," Okay.  Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," And you are?  Nice to meet you, Mr.  Well, Rarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home."
"Patrick"," And this is my home."
"SpongeBob"," Where is your home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home."
"Patrick"," Doesn't have a home?  Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rarrg. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he smashed your house."
"Patrick"," Yeah.  He's gonna smash your house now."
"SpongeBob","  He's going to smash my house! Gary!  Gary! Jump, Gary, jump!  Parachute, Gary. Use your parachute. "
"Patrick"," He's gonna smash Squidward's place now. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, I don't-- "
"Patrick"," Encore!  Wow, the police have arrived."
"SpongeBob"," And they built a cute, little fence around Rarrg.  Hi, Squidward, you're home early. "
"Squidward"," I live here.  And what's so funny?"
"Squidward"," I'll have you know, sir, that my home is a-- pile of gravel?! "
"Squidward"," Alert the what?"
"SpongeBob"," He waved at you, Squidward. That means he likes you."
"Squidward"," He likes me. Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see. "
"Patrick"," Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me."
"Patrick"," Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst. "
"Patrick","  Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun."
"Patrick"," It really crushes my heart to see him go."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, crushes. Patrick, ""crushes""—that gives me an idea. "
"Patrick","  Yeah? Okay.  Two cubes, please. "
"SpongeBob","  Your ice cubes, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Don't thank me. Thank Raarg."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where's my alarm clock?"
"SpongeBob","  Your shell is gone too?"
"SpongeBob"," I think we've been robbed!"
"Squidward"," AAAAAAHHH!!!! She's gone! My clarinet has gone missing!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, strange indeed..."
"Patrick"," AAAAAAHHH!!!! My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why? "
"SpongeBob"," I hope this doesn't mean that we're missing the one thing that's nearest and dearest to our heart."
"Squidward"," Nope, I'm right here."
"SpongeBob"," The Krusty Krab!  Pheww."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," Drama queen."
"SpongeBob"," Where's your dad?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs is missing?"
"Squidward"," I'm missing my clarinet."
"SpongeBob"," ...and Gary's shell."
"Patrick"," Has anyone seen my cuff links?!"
"SpongeBob"," Bikini Bottom Triangle?"
"SpongeBob"," The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs. We gotta find him!"
"Squidward"," Maybe he's doing his morning dumpster dive for change."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, are you out here?"
"Squidward"," Oh no, is that a mermaid song?"
"SpongeBob"," No, just a thick eerie fog."
"Squidward"," Ohh no!!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward, stop messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra- hey, gumballs! ."
"Squidward"," OOOHHHH! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs?  Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!"
"Squidward"," Oh, my neck."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! Mr. Kraaaaaabbbbbsssss!"
"Squidward"," Would you shut it already?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. I can't take it much longer! Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in too much pain...where ever he is."
"Squidward"," Oh, I think Mr. Krabs is doing just fine."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up. We gotta get out of here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohh, Okay, Tibor I think I'm good."
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song, the mermaids' song triggers this here contraption, to suck this pile like a vacuum. Dumpin' all the contents here on this island, that is how we ended up surrounded. With all this valuable and resellable stuff!  Oh, Yippee! Another shipment! Free stuff, here I- come?  Pretty neat, aye, boy? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Have you found my cuff links?"
"SpongeBob"," No.  Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?"
"Patrick"," Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl?  Oh, my sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids."
"SpongeBob"," That's it Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!"
"Patrick"," Ah, riding by piggy-back is exhausting."
"SpongeBob"," You're telling me. "
"Patrick"," Whoa."
"Patrick"," Ah, excuse me, hi."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Yes mermaid ladies, you actually can help us."
"Patrick","  Yeah..."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, we'd like to know how to get out of here, please."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, are you sure?"
"SpongeBob"," T.N.O.P?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, T.N.O.P! Okay, well thanks anyway, come on Patrick, let's go. Patrick?"
"Patrick","  You go ahead SpongeBob. I think I'm gonna hang with the ladies a bit. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on...  Ah ha, playing hard to get, weren't you little one?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm back, Unfortunately, I was unable to get the information from the ahhh "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob, boy-o! SpongeBob can you hear me?"
"Squidward"," He looks fine to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the matter, boy-o?  You're Krabby Patty meter is on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or-  Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one-  ...Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, thank you, Boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there urr... there is no way out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies."
"SpongeBob"," Well, sir, I-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here.  So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business."
"Mr. Krabs"," T.N.O.P?"
"SpongeBob"," Totally Not Our Problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Pearl, he's okay. "
"Mr. Krabs"," The mall? But Pearl-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh do you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner."
"SpongeBob"," That's it sir! It's the mermaids!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It sure is, what?"
"SpongeBob"," The reverse switch is the mermaids, they just need to sing their song, backwards."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, backwards, what a stupid idea that-"
"Squidward"," Hello, miserable life, I'm back."
"SpongeBob"," Isn't that great, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is reclaiming their stuff."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Speaking of re-claiming... alright Plankton, I know what you're up to but, the jigs up you little conniving pipsqueak! Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, you've been the one making me Krabby Patties?"
"Plankton","  Vermin? You take that back!"
"Patrick"," Hey! I found my cuff links!  that's better. Good day, gentlemen."
"Patrick"," Home, Reginald."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! You forgot your cummerbund!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahhh, the end of another successful business day. You know Squidward this kind of day always reminds me of money  Ahhahhahah.... "
"Squidward"," Ohh yeah, that's nice. I'll be here working while you.....AHHHHHHHH!  Uhhhh. Uhhh...Ummmm...I'm sorry mam,  but were closed. . I know you're hungry but- . Uhhh...but we really are closed. Thank-you, come-again."
"Squidward"," Hey!! Closed means closed, Grandma!  Oh boy, Some people... "
"Squidward"," I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out."
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward"," No way."
"Squidward"," Never..."
"Squidward","  Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady."
"Mr. Krabs","  No way granny!"
"Squidward"," Nope."
"SpongeBob","  How sad."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I've certainly seen enough ."
"Squidward"," What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back ."
"SpongeBob","  Need to know in case she ever- ."
"SpongeBob","  Have a good night Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you too SpongeBob. Have a good-  Night..."
"SpongeBob","  Old lady? Old lady?"
"SpongeBob"," Actually I told you to meet me two paces to the left."
"SpongeBob"," Oh good, you're here!  I brought the stuff."
"SpongeBob"," You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us."
"Mr. Krabs"," Too late! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, it's true!"
"SpongeBob"," H-How did you find out?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Or before he takes off his sleep mask."
"Mr. Krabs"," How did you know I wear a sleep mask?"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Pleaaaseee! "
"Mr. Krabs","  We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage-  charity..."
"SpongeBob"," But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, boy! Spit it out!"
"SpongeBob"," The- the- the- the- the-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, let's see what's under the hood.  I think that should do it."
"SpongeBob"," What about the curse?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Curse? Boy, let me explain something about curses with a short story me grandpappy used to tell me Oh yes, CURSES ARE NONSENSE!!"
"SpongeBob"," They are, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right Squidward?"
"Squidward"," You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob "
"Mr. Krabs","  See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed."
"Squidward"," And why is that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!"
"Squidward"," That's not a curse.  That's a blessing."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha."
"Mr. Krabs"," ME MONEYYY!!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!"
"SpongeBob"," I got it! I got it!  Ohh, Ohh Hot, hot!  I don't got it..."
"Squidward"," I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract."
"Squidward"," There is a no-contract clause in it too."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob. I don't think were ever gonna find-"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, look!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all."
"Mr. Krabs","  See, told ya'"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-"
"SpongeBob"," Oh anything, Great Hagfish."
"SpongeBob"," Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel."
"Mr. Krabs"," How could you tell?"
"SpongeBob"," She gave me its business card."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-"
"SpongeBob"," ...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it, SpongeBob, Look. "
"SpongeBob"," It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good idea, be careful not to-"
"SpongeBob","  WOAAHHH!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's awake!"
"SpongeBob"," Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-"
"SpongeBob"," ...Hide behind...  WOAAAH!!!!"
"SpongeBob","  Morning, already.  I'm coming Mr. Krabs  Don't go anywhere!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I really don't have a choice "
"SpongeBob"," Take, this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job ladee!"
"SpongeBob"," We're not finished yet!  I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!  I don't got it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised."
"SpongeBob"," A closed sign?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it? That's the curse?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing like a fresh frozen Krabby Patty with extra freezer burn flavor.  Here we go... Hmm, grill look a tad dirty. "
"Squidward"," Hold that thought.  SpongeBob, what is all that r..."
"SpongeBob","  Say! Who wants...the first patty from our freshly cleaned grill?! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay! How about you, Squid-"
"Squidward"," No! I do not want a Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  You suuure?"
"Squidward"," Don't touch me."
"Squidward"," I've seen what he cleans the grill with. "
"SpongeBob"," Now all I need is a fresh patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where'd all this water come from?  There we go. Oh my stars and garters, the sink is clogged up.  Safety.  Now what seem to be the trouble?  Patrick, what happened? "
"Patrick"," There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then BOOM!  Some dumbbell put this thing in the way.  Whatcha doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Trying to see what has this sink all backed up. Would you excuse me a second?"
"Patrick"," Uh-huh. "
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ha!  Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug.  Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug."
"Mr. Krabs","  THE DRAIN PLUG!?!?!?  SpongeBob!!!  What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?"
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr. Krabs?"
"Patrick"," Sorry. "
"Mr. Krabs"," As I was saying... It happened a long time ago... Patrick! ...to a pair of little kids."
"Patrick","  Two little kids? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Anyway,  it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell. "
"Mr. Krabs","  One day, those two kids were wandering through the ocean, when they stumble upon it. "
"Mr. Krabs","  The Main Drain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em.  And they pulled the plug.  The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down.  The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea!  And nobody was ever heard from...again."
"SpongeBob","  Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you.  So, so, so get out of here and stay away from that drain! No plugs will be pulled on my watch. "
"Patrick"," Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies."
"SpongeBob"," The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous. I'm never gonna go near that thing."
"Patrick"," We should go find it! To protect it from people like us."
"SpongeBob"," What if we get sucked in like those other two kids!"
"Patrick"," Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up!  Hey! A baby tooth!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton"," Owwwww!"
"Patrick"," Ewwwwww..."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Hi Plankton!"
"Plankton"," EEEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!"
"Patrick"," Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer."
"Plankton"," What stupid question do you want the answer to? Idiots."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, and I are trying to find the Main Drain"
"Plankton","  The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but Mr. Krabs said-"
"Plankton"," Krabs?! Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail. There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea. So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!"
"Plankton"," Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?"
"SpongeBob"," I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick"," So we've been looking for it!"
"SpongeBob"," Does the Main Drain even exist?"
"SpongeBob","  Where is the Drain oh, wise Jenkins?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! We need to find that Drain!"
"Patrick"," Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't your curiosity piqued? What if somebody accidentally pulls it? What if- What if-"
"Patrick","  Oh man, I hope this question;s not for me. I hate questions."
"SpongeBob"," What do you think, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Dah-uhhh! 42. No, triangle! Meatballs! Screwdrivers! Pajamas! "
"SpongeBob"," I hear ya' Patrick! Let's go find that Main Drain!"
"Patrick"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Let's start walkin'"
"Patrick"," Oh, no thanks. I'm not into the whole walking thing."
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?"
"Patrick"," Wait for it to come to us."
"SpongeBob"," Hmmmm...I have a better idea!  Well, what do you think?"
"Patrick"," I love it!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's out."
"SpongeBob"," I know!! "
"Squidward","  Another miserable day..."
"SpongeBob"," Ohh. How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?"
"Patrick"," Oh! Oh! I know exactly what to do!  NEEIIGGHH "
"Squidward"," Owwwwwww. That's better..."
"SpongeBob"," Doin' great Patrick! We'll be there in no time!"
"Patrick","  Owww. Oh.  Huh, I found it!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow. Good job..."
"Patrick"," Let's pull it."
"SpongeBob"," WHAT?!?!?! Why would we do that?!"
"Patrick"," Well, that was the whole point of coming here right?"
"SpongeBob"," NOOO!!!! We came to see if it was real!"
"Patrick"," Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?"
"SpongeBob"," We- We don't know..."
"Patrick"," We won't know unless we pull it!"
"SpongeBob"," But...if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end!"
"Patrick"," And if we don't, we'll never know..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain! You see..."
"Plankton"," We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right one day, Plankton and I were wandering around."
"Mr. Krabs"," You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it."
"Plankton"," We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made."
"SpongeBob"," Pheeeww. That was a close one..."
"Patrick"," Yeah, We almost messed up big time. Pheeeww. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Patrick"," "
"Patrick","  It's the most realistic story I've ever heard! "
"Patrick","  You see him?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope.  Oh wait, now I do."
"Patrick","  What's he doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, just kinda sitting there."
"Patrick"," How about now?"
"SpongeBob"," Still just like kinda sitting there, same thing."
"Patrick"," How long have we been watching?"
"SpongeBob"," What time is it now?"
"Patrick"," 230."
"SpongeBob","  4 days."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's moving!"
"Patrick"," Ready to go for it?"
"SpongeBob"," Like Mr. Krabs says, it's now or never!"
"Patrick"," When does he say that?"
"SpongeBob"," Usually on his way to the Men's room. Bunsai!!!"
"Patrick"," Hey, that's usually what I say!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, he's taking evasive action."
"Patrick"," We better fake him."
"SpongeBob"," I'll fake left, you go right!"
"Patrick"," Roger that! "
"SpongeBob"," Other right, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow, I think I ruptured a spleen..."
"Patrick"," I think I shattered my abacus."
"SpongeBob"," Your what?"
"Patrick"," My abacus.  Nope. Seems okay..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! There it goes! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't stop now, Patrick, we're gaining on him! "
"SpongeBob"," Ehhh."
"SpongeBob"," Well, actually Patrick has been trying to shed a few-"
"SpongeBob"," We're really sorry about interrupting your-"
"SpongeBob"," Umm..."
"Patrick"," Worthy of what?"
"SpongeBob"," ...specifically."
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick! He's gonna play us a little song. "
"SpongeBob"," Short song."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I think this is meant to be a-a musical challenge."
"SpongeBob"," Challenge? ] Patrick, we don't even have an instrument to play. "
"Patrick"," Yeah, and soon we won't have anything to play it with..."
"SpongeBob"," Huh! Patrick! Hang on...  "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, don't leave me!"
"SpongeBob"," Wouldn't dream of it, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Alright!   "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, even though you won, it looks like he was the real star. Hahaha. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's a singing competition. What are we gonna do?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, but I am a sure thirsty after that fiddlin'. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, give me some of that!  "
"SpongeBob"," Looks like we're on a roll, eh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Let me see more."
"SpongeBob"," My compliments to the chef."
"SpongeBob"," Hah! Well, actually, my friend and I, we don't like to wrestle."
"SpongeBob"," No, we're not the wrestling sort."
"SpongeBob"," Well, uh-uh, we like to go jellyfishing!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it goes something like this "
"SpongeBob"," Now, Patrick!  Well, something like that anyway..."
"Patrick"," Nice knowing you buddy..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess if I were to say one thing, and I think I'm speaking for Patrick and myself here, is that y'all are a bunch a' real kind folks and it's been a real hoot gettin' to know y'all!  Farewall, friendly trenchbillies. See ya' 'round."
"Patrick"," Toodles."
"SpongeBob"," Over to home."
"Patrick"," Takin' care a' Ma?"
"SpongeBob"," For the rest of our natural-born lives?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, and, iambic pentameter gives me a headache! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh please, Mr. Trenchbillie, where can we-"
"Patrick"," Oh hey, your shoe's untied."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what was I supposed to tell them, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," You could have told him that he could have his money back."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no I couldn't."
"Squidward"," Why?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because, I already put it in the register!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! We just escaped from an angry mob of deep sea bunkins!"
"Patrick"," It was horrible! They were gonna make us stay forever and massage their grandma."
"Mr. Krabs"," So. Why ya' telling me?"
"SpongeBob"," Because they followed us here. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Keep them coming, SpongeBob! This is the most business in a long time!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye', captain! I'm gonna get some more buns."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh yeah, that's what I like to see. She's gonna make customer of the week."
"Mr. Krabs","   Noooooo!!!!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Oh, I’ve got an whole new, attitude♪"
"Squidward"," Oh is that supposed to be singing?  I am putting that one on SpongeBob.  Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪I cherish my fellow residents...♪"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, why are you doing this?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!"
"Squidward"," Gratitude? You've been wallowing in filth all morning. What could you possibly be grateful for?"
"SpongeBob"," Hit it, boys! ♪Oh, I’ve got an whole new, attitude, A life-time subscription to, gratitude, Friend you’ve got to change your, platitude, Live an attitude of, gratitude, I’m grateful for the life I am living, Who knows how long I will have it, I’m thankful for all I’ve been given, We make appreciation a habit, There’s no time like the present day, To have a present come your way, , So now I think that you will see , There’s nothing more you need, My friend this ain't no, platitude , Just an attitude of, gratitude .♪ Or in your case, Squidward, an attitude of hattitude!

"Squidward"," Keep your hat and your gratitude! Because having you as a neighbor has left me with nothing to be grateful for! "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, Squidward, looks like you need to get your plumbing looked at."
"Squidward"," This is your fault!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand."
"Squidward"," No, you have helped me enough. I don't want your help ever again!"
"SpongeBob"," No problem, pal. "
"Squidward"," Moron.  Stupid pipe!  Oh, great. Now I'm late for work."
"Squidward"," Don't jump in a coral pit."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, how many times do i have to tell you, the customers' jokes are always funny! Now, give the gentlemen a chuckle."
"Squidward"," Ha ha ha."
"Squidward"," Stop staring, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," That'll will be three dollars."
"Squidward"," I don't have time to count all that!"
"Squidward"," Oh, please do, I'm trying to get some work done here. Sheesh, some people just want to waste your time.  Hey, buddy, how am I supposed to focus with all of that incessant tapping? And what do you think you're doing, sir?"
"Squidward"," No, you're not. You're leaving your grummy finger prints all over the glass! And now yours truly is gonna have to clean it up! Why does everyone insist on making my job so difficult?!  You always leave trash on the table!  Your teeth chatter!  Your hat annoys me!  You take too long in the restroom!  And SpongeBob, would you quit singing that song?"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it could be worse."
"Squidward"," How could life in Bikini Bottom possibly get any worse?"
"SpongeBob"," That's how."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, ya lemons. Afraid of a little lavar? CASHY! No! Make it stop raining fire of destruction! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry to interupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it?  Fear not, shelter can be found—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? The civilization as we know is crumbling to dust!  Civilic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yes. Of course, ma'am.  Try and behave yourselves, fellas."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something."
"SpongeBob","  Actually, I just had a question about these parking tickets. I don't have a car."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy. Morons."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, who do you think is the most miserable person?"
"Squidward"," Don't know, don't care. "
"SpongeBob"," But, Squidward, it's imperative that we..."
"Squidward","  But, Squidward, it is imperative that we...  Nothing! I think I'd rather take my chances with the volcano than be stuck in this miserable barnacle hole with you,  and the citizens of Dumb-Dumb Town! "
"Squidward"," What?  You idiots. You've got the wrong guy!"
"Squidward","  I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom!  Let me down, you goons!"
"Squidward"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! It was I who made Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead."
"Squidward"," Well, I'm glad that y'all came to your senses. Bunch of ingrates. Come on, SpongeBob. Jump in. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, help!"
"SpongeBob"," I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!"
"Squidward"," I take it back!  Please, SpongeBob, I didn't mean any of that! I do appreciate your friendship. I am grateful. I'm... I'm...  I'm grateful for the life I'm living! Who knows how long I'll have it? I learned that from you, remember? Goodbye, everyone!  Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, I always knew you felt that way.  Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us."
"Squidward"," My house!"
"Squidward"," But I thought you said a sacrifice had to be made of the most miserable person."
"Squidward"," You know, SpongeBob. In light of everything that just happened... I lied to you. I'm not grateful for anything! I mean look at me. I don't even have a roof to sleep under, anymore!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I wouldn't say that. "
"Squidward"," Go away. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it, boy?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob?  There, there, kid. What's the big deal?"
"SpongeBob"," M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs!  We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days."
"Mr. Krabs"," I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," You never forget, boss man."
"Mr. Krabs"," What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Sea Salt. "
"SpongeBob","  Turmeric."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt."
"SpongeBob"," That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?"
"SpongeBob"," Scabs, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Was it pustule?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all."
"Plankton"," No need to wonder about this. I got your formula.  Yee-haw!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this."
"Plankton"," Ow."
"Mr. Krabs"," I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out of the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer."
"Mr. Krabs"," Take care of yourself, little formula."
"SpongeBob","  Good-bye, secret recipe!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties."
"SpongeBob"," I believe we were at turmeric."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, I thought I told you--"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no we forgot to look at the..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Formula, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," And that formula is..."
"Mr. Krabs"," On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Think you're up for the challenge?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, all right then,  the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This, No. This is the key to me heart?  This is the safe-deposit box key."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, thank you Mr.--"
"Mr. Krabs","  Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life.  It shan't leaveth my sight."
"Mr. Krabs","  Good, let's get you over at the train station."
"Plankton"," This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't up wait for me, baby. "
"SpongeBob"," The Oceanic Express.  Wish me luck."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, a real-life butler."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! "
"Plankton","  Wait! Wait for me!  Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta--  Oh, now they're on time... Uh-uh... "
"SpongeBob"," Couldn't be better, butler."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, my good man.  I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy."
"Patrick"," Peek-a-boo!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you?  I think he might be spying on us.  Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Well, then follow me to the dining car."
"Plankton","  Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way!  Uh-oh.  I knew I'd make it... "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh Fancy."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella."
"SpongeBob","  Hi again, kind butler."
"SpongeBob","  But we haven't even heard the specials yet."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry, ma'am."
"SpongeBob"," Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. "
"Patrick"," What is that?"
"SpongeBob"," That my dear Patrick is—the key!  Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. "
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key."
"Plankton"," Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet."
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you."
"Plankton"," You calling me a liar?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes. Search him, Patrick."
"Patrick","  With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty."
"Plankton"," Oh, drat."
"Patrick","  Just after I scrub this bowl.  Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you.  After my tasty snack.  He's clean. "
"Plankton","  I told you I wasn't lying."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops."
"Patrick","  Cops, I need you! "
"Squidward"," For the last time, we're out of patties.  No need to get excited now."
"Squidward"," That's Krusty Krab property.  That's a load-bearing column.  Hurry, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act.  Where were you at 642pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff."
"Plankton"," Oh brother."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Police Commissioner?"
"SpongeBob"," I sub--  I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny."
"SpongeBob"," Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key."
"SpongeBob"," The key!"
"SpongeBob"," Triplets?"
"SpongeBob"," If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler."
"SpongeBob"," We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime."
"Patrick"," You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? "
"Plankton"," Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! "
"Patrick"," Sorry. "
"Plankton"," Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin."
"Plankton"," Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key."
"SpongeBob"," Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself."
"Plankton"," Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key."
"SpongeBob"," I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. "
"SpongeBob"," After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs.  I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab."
"Patrick","  Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up."
"SpongeBob"," The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?"
"Patrick"," I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little ""accident"" earlier."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that is great news."
"Patrick","  Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, yeah, me, too. "
"Plankton","  Me, three. "
"Patrick"," Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows."
"SpongeBob"," I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite."
"Plankton"," Here, maybe I can help. "
"SpongeBob","  Fresh water."
"Patrick"," What a cool view."
"Plankton"," Yeah, have a better look.  And thanks for the key!"
"Patrick"," Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob?  Guess not. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?"
"Patrick"," Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?"
"SpongeBob"," That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? "
"Patrick"," Great, now what?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, hop up on my back."
"Patrick"," Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride."
"SpongeBob"," Just do it."
"Patrick"," Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr--  Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please!  Hey, we're flying!"
"SpongeBob"," There you go, buddy.  Oh, Plankton!"
"Patrick"," You can't hide forever. "
"Plankton"," Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Plankton, end of the line!  Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Over here, choo-choo heads. "
"Patrick"," That was odd."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and Plankton still has the key.  Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look."
"Patrick"," Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?"
"SpongeBob"," That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there."
"Patrick"," Hmm. In that case... "
"Plankton","  It's too easy. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open."
"Patrick"," What do I do? What do I do?  B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. "
"SpongeBob","  You broke the brake?"
"Patrick"," It told me to."
"SpongeBob"," What do we do now?  Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!"
"Patrick"," I'm on it.  Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train."
"SpongeBob"," Um, who?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hi."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, the back of the train is gone!"
"SpongeBob"," Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?"
"SpongeBob"," What is that?"
"Patrick"," Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us!  Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon...  Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! "
"SpongeBob"," 'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... "
"Patrick"," Hey. Hey, wait for me...  Hey, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Whoa! "
"Patrick"," Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. "
"Patrick"," Hmm.  T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that.  You didn't need this, did you? "
"Plankton"," Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha.  Come to papa!  At last, my day of triumph has come! Again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, well. "
"Plankton"," What? B-b-but how?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?"
"Plankton","I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs","  Sure. I believe ya.  Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton.  Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?"
"Plankton"," Checkmate, Krabs!  Ow."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job, boyo."
"SpongeBob"," I simply refused to fail, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'. Take care of it, will ya boy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No...!"
"SpongeBob","  And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?"
"SpongeBob"," Kids today. "
"Squidward"," Stop playing... in my yard!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway."
"Patrick"," No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce."
"Squidward"," Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!"
"Patrick"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play innnn... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob!  I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!"
"Squidward"," I choose Patrick...  to play in Patrick's yard...  and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody...  in here! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  The road!  Patrick! What are we gonna do?"
"Patrick"," I'll mail myself to your house! "
"SpongeBob"," Sit tight, Patrick! I'm coming to get you!  Nooo!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick.  Patrick! Call me!"
"Patrick"," Okay! "
"SpongeBob","  SquarePants residence."
"Patrick"," What are we gonna do?!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmmm... have we ever dug a tunnel between our two houses?"
"Patrick"," No.  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," Tag! You're it! "
"Patrick"," Tag!You're it!"
"SpongeBob"," Tag! You're it!"
"Patrick"," Tag! You're it!"
"SpongeBob"," Peek-a-boo! I see you!"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," You're it!"
"Patrick"," You're it! "
"Squidward","  Must... block... out... noise! "
"Patrick"," Knock, knock!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's there?"
"Patrick"," I don't know! "
"Squidward","  I thought I told you two to stay off my...  yard.  Patrick!  Patrick, would you shut...?  Where is he?  SpongeBob.  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, I am trying to...  sleep?  Aha!  Hey, Gary."
"Squidward"," Where are those two morons?  Where are they?!"
"SpongeBob","  Ohh... Patrick, check out these roots!"
"Patrick"," They're dancing!"
"SpongeBob"," Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance Davey! "
"Patrick"," Squidward's house wants to play too!"
"Squidward"," My house! "
"SpongeBob"," Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy."
"Patrick"," Must've been something it ate. "
"SpongeBob"," It ate Squidward!"
"Patrick","  That'll do it"
"Squidward","  I knew you two reprobates were behind this."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! We're reprobates!"
"Squidward"," That was an insult."
"Patrick"," And we're insulted!"
"Squidward"," Why were you digging under my yard?"
"SpongeBob"," You told us not to walk on your yard, so, we walked under it."
"Squidward"," But you buried my house!"
"Patrick"," No need to thank us."
"Squidward"," Thank you?!?"
"Patrick"," You're welcome."
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Missed."
"SpongeBob"," Somebody wants to play Tag!"
"Patrick"," Tag! You're it! "
"SpongeBob"," Not it!"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Whee!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward wins!"
"Squidward"," Now, you're gonna play a new game called, ""Digging Out my House!"""
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! "
"Squidward"," And I'm gonna play ""Sit and Relax"" until you're finished.  Barnacle brains.  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Yuh oh!"
"Squidward"," I'm warning you If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three. I am going to grind you into chum! One!"
"Patrick","  He's counting, anything but counting! Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!"
"Squidward"," Two!"
"Patrick"," He's already at number two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?"
"Squidward"," Th-ree!"
"Plankton"," Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts."
"SpongeBob","  Must dig! Ohhh! The rock's too hard! "
"Squidward","  You... two... morons... sunk my house!"
"Squidward"," I'm gonna-  Uh, oh. "
"SpongeBob","  Ahhhh.  Good morning, Squidward! Another beautiful day under Bikini Bottom!"
"Squidward","  I hate neighbors."
"SpongeBob","  HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness. "
"SpongeBob"," Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?! "
"Patrick"," Hey buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese?  Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you! "
"Patrick"," Buddy! You okay?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again buddy. HIYA! "
"Patrick","   Hey! I want to learn how to do that. "
"SpongeBob","  What, what you mean karate?"
"Patrick"," Uhhuh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to..."
"Patrick"," If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah... However..."
"Patrick"," I also remember you saying, ""If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know."
"SpongeBob"," Well I did say that Patrick but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface. "
"Patrick"," Then teach me."
"SpongeBob"," As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility."
"Patrick"," Oh yeah Mama! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Lets start off simple. This is a basic move called ""the inverted whirlpool""."
"Patrick"," Inverty whirpey... Got it! "
"Patrick"," Woohoo! That was awesome!"
"SpongeBob"," Think you can handle that?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Yeah!  Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!  Hey, how do you stop this thing? "
"SpongeBob"," Now this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?"
"Patrick"," Definitely! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable. "
"Patrick"," What?! I...!  Barnacles!"
"SpongeBob","  Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!"
"Patrick"," Wow!"
"SpongeBob"," You're a natural! A karate genius!"
"Patrick"," Clamo!"
"SpongeBob","  Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing! "
"SpongeBob"," This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes? "
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh... better luck next time. "
"Patrick"," Yeah! I bet I can chop anything! "
"Patrick"," HIIIII-"
"SpongeBob","  Noooooo! What did I tell you?!"
"Patrick"," I'm a genius?"
"SpongeBob"," Not that!  ...this.  With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?"
"Patrick"," Yesss..."
"SpongeBob"," Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said."
"Patrick"," Okay! I'm a genius! "
"Patrick","  Karate power! "
"Squidward","  What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look, it's Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi-yah SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing... "
"SpongeBob"," *Gasps* Dear Neptune!"
"Patrick"," Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!"
"Squidward"," A... What?"
"Patrick"," I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick","  Looks delish."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?"
"Patrick"," I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due."
"SpongeBob"," But, but, but-"
"Patrick"," No buts! Just hands. "
"SpongeBob"," Oooohhh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check."
"Patrick"," Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch!  Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!"
"Patrick"," What do you say to a trade? "
"Patrick"," You dare refuse my barter?!?! Than accept my chop!  Ahhh... I don't feel so good."
"Patrick","  What is that wonderful stench?  Whatcha got there?"
"Patrick","  NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! "
"Patrick"," I win, I win, I win! "
"Patrick"," HIYAA HIYAA-"
"SpongeBob"," Mad chopper?! Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen."
"SpongeBob"," Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," For what?"
"Patrick"," For teaching me how to karate chop, silly."
"SpongeBob"," You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!"
"Patrick","  Wooooooooooo."
"SpongeBob"," Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," You got it, buddy. No more karate chops! "
"SpongeBob"," You're still chopping!"
"Patrick"," I know! Weird, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, stop it!"
"Patrick"," Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop! Patrick chops his hand and it hits his face"""
"SpongeBob"," You must resist!  AHHHHHAAHH! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait up, Patrick!  Triton's tunic!"
"Patrick"," HIYA YA! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH!"
"Patrick"," Not the giant-screen TVs! Oh no!"
"Patrick"," Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA! "
"SpongeBob"," Pull it together, buddy!"
"Patrick"," I'm trying to but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn...  YAAAAAA! "
"Patrick"," YA YA HIYA AYA!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SPONGEBOB!!! Oh no, I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag. "
"Patrick","  So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! Oh no!  Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself  No! I'll never forgive you! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Your arm!"
"Patrick"," Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray for regeneration!"
"Patrick"," And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the unnatural details."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!"
"Patrick"," Oh I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies."
"SpongeBob","  ♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love cookin' me some Krabby Patties! Feedin' all the children and the mommies and the daddies! Love servin' up the most delicious dish, but before I can, gotta add a little of this!♪  Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce.  Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. ""Use on or before the date printed below.""  This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm. Future generations, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy!  All right, you guys got donations covered, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Sir, yes, sir!"
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!"
"SpongeBob"," The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the..."
"Squidward"," Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?"
"SpongeBob"," What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading."
"Squidward"," No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?"
"Squidward","  ""Hmm. Oh, whatever will I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about  this lamp?! It's  perfect!"""
"Squidward"," Next. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, nice pass, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?"
"Squidward"," Right. This plate is actually not meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity."
"Squidward","  Uh-huh.  Interesting.  This is a promising sign. Yep.  You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250."
"Squidward"," No. "
"SpongeBob","  You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!"
"Squidward"," Next. "
"SpongeBob","  A four-striped sock! Incredible!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices."
"SpongeBob"," After you then!"
"Patrick"," Thank you, my good man."
"Squidward"," Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...?  What t-.."
"Patrick"," Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now."
"Squidward"," Oh, no, you don't! "
"SpongeBob"," You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would."
"Patrick"," What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're very good at that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And thanks so much for all your contributions! So, are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?! "
"Plankton"," Ugh! Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop, a stupid time capsule. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!"
"Plankton","  There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Send her down! "
"SpongeBob","  He shoots, he scores!"
"Squidward","  Get off me! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, whatcha doing?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it looks fun!"
"Squidward"," WE JUST GOT BURIED ALIVE, YOU IDIOTS!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, but what are you doing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry? "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?"
"Patrick"," I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years."
"Patrick","  50 years? What are we gonna do till then?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here!  It's our favorite game!"
"Patrick"," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?"
"Patrick"," I believe my left hand was on red."
"SpongeBob"," My right foot was on blue."
"Patrick"," Forehead on yellow."
"SpongeBob"," Left foot on green. [kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick"
"Squidward"," That's it, this game is over! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm. "
"SpongeBob","  Wow, special drinking fountains for short people! What will the future think of next? "
"Patrick"," Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with the perfect blend of commerce and irrigation.  Not to mention the breathtaking views. "
"SpongeBob"," Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?"
"Plankton","  Jackpot! And now to extract the secret recipe.  Careful. Careful. "
"Patrick"," Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out.  Whipped cream!  Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful!  ""Sha-veeng g-el."" I've always wanted a beard!"
"SpongeBob"," Me too!  Do you want one too, Squidbeard? "
"Squidward","  Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already?  Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!"
"Plankton","  Secret recipe, where are you? Aha! "
"Squidward"," Hello, future!  Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years! "
"Plankton"," Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe! "
"Squidward","  Dig me out when my life doesn't stink."
"Plankton"," Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes."
"Squidward"," Okay, beloved sanctuary.  I'll see you after work.  And we'll have a nice, relaxing evening.  Just you and me.  That is, of course, if I can survive another day  with GratingBob ShrillPants."
"Patrick"," OOH! [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick, who is holding up  big rock with his chest"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Hm.  Wow. Those two are just so amazingly stupid."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Grrr!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, Isn't this fun?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! I love playing Buddy Toss! "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Squidward! See you at work!"
"Squidward"," Grrr!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"Patrick"," Ow!"
"Squidward","  Okay. I can do this. Just put them out of my mi..."
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"Squidward","  A nine-letter word for annoying SpongeBob.  Ugh.  Finally. Some peace and quiet.  No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home.  Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it. [eel sting. Patrick screams. He and SpongeBob laugh. "
"Squidward"," No, no, no!  Grrr! "
"SpongeBob"," Something Squidward this way comes."
"Squidward"," Alright you two, I am trying to have a relaxing evening. What in the world are you doing out here?!"
"Patrick"," Trying to have a relaxing evening."
"SpongeBob"," We're playing flashlight tag."
"Squidward"," You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?"
"SpongeBob"," We're using the advanced rules."
"Squidward"," Advanced rules?! That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever- "
"Patrick"," You're it. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well played, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Shocking!"
"Squidward","  All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax in peace  and quiet.  Is that too much to ask? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, we're playing tag, not hide and seek, you silly!"
"Patrick"," But we like hide and go seeks too, if you want to play that."
"Squidward","  All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax  in peace!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Squidward is really really sad..."
"Patrick"," You're right. Let's go poke someone else."
"SpongeBob","  How about instead we do something extra special for him? Then he won't be sad anymore!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I get it! It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all Gary's...Uh... I mean, feed Gary for a week."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to do it."
"Patrick"," Vow?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, vow."
"Patrick"," Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?"
"SpongeBob"," I like it!"
"Squidward","  Good night... lamp.  I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools!  Well, it's not that late, even morons have to sleep sometime."
"Squidward"," I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!"
"Squidward"," When I get those two, I am gonna...  All right, you two, I... "
"Squidward"," It's, it's, it's... beautiful! It's too good to be true! It's a mirage. I knew it."
"Squidward","  Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home!  Just go with it, Squiddy."
"Squidward"," A refill, my good man! What the-  Patrick?! What are you doing here!?"
"Squidward"," It's delicious! What is it?"
"Patrick"," A smoothie."
"Squidward"," Remember Squiddy, just go with it."
"Squidward"," Hit it boys!"
"Squidward"," Or drink from a coconut that's full of flan!"
"Squidward"," Don't matter to me 'cause... 'cause I'm CRAZY, man!"
"Squidward"," Ahhhh, this is the life!"
"SpongeBob"," It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!"
"Squidward"," I've never felt this happy in my life! "
"Squidward"," My world!"
"Patrick"," You were right, SpongeBob, we should have used glue instead of earwax."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears."
"Squidward","  You've destroyed my beautiful world!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry we couldn't make it last, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we really tried to make it last."
"Squidward","  Yeah, make it last, "
"Squidward"," I know how to make it last!"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick","  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," My turn! Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, sir, I believe I was in line first. . I spent the night! That's how you get the best spot around here!  I'm meeting my best friend for an exciting day at Glove World!.  See? ""Glove World!"" I promised Patrick we'd be first in line for the first bus to Glove World!."
"SpongeBob"," But I spend the night so that I could... uh... Okay, I guess. ."
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob! Are you ready to...  SpongeBob, you promised firsties!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Patrick. But, we'll still be on the first bus to Glove World!!"
"SpongeBob"," Glove World!! Glove World!! Glove World!!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Howdy, little buddy! I need your help with an experiment!"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, Sandy, I'd like to but I'll miss the first bus to Glove World!."
"Sandy"," But this is an emergency! SpongeBob? Pleeaase?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay! Patrick, I'll catch the next bus! See you there! "
"Sandy"," Operation acorn smoothie is a success!"

"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, today's my day off!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Um. Pearl? About those shoes? No."
"SpongeBob"," Grandma? Oh... coming, Grandma. "
"Patrick","  Oh man! That was the best time I've ever had!  Oh. Hello, SpongeBob. Did you enjoy not going to Glove World! with me?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, I tried, how I tried! But everyone needed my help and I, uh..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you've got to learn to say 'no'. Stand up for yourself! You need thicker skin like me! . Oh, hey, which reminds me.  Could you scratch my back?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, it's true, Gar-bear! It's true!"
"SpongeBob"," It's true that I can't stand up for myself. I'm too soft! How I wish I had thicker skin! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, what's this?  Don't throw out that old too soft sponge, toughen it with a new abrasive side!  Say! Gary did you order this for me?"
"SpongeBob","  Ah, It fits like a glove!"

"Patrick"," Gosh!"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh what?"
"Patrick"," I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics."

"SpongeBob"," Hide 'n seek!"

"SpongeBob"," Oh, good!"

"SpongeBob"," What's that?"
"Patrick"," What's hide 'n seek? "
"SpongeBob","  You think you're getting it now, Patrick? Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?"
"Patrick"," Hide and seek a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players.  The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you really are getting it!"
"Patrick"," Hide 'n seek sure sounds fun,  I just wish I could play! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, come on. Of course we can play!"
"Patrick"," Oh no! I can't! "
"SpongeBob"," Why can't you?"
"Patrick"," Because... I don't have any socks! "
"SpongeBob"," No Patrick, forget about the socks."
"Patrick"," What socks?"
"SpongeBob"," Never mind, just start counting."
"Patrick","  One, two, three... "
"SpongeBob"," That's perfect! Now I'm gonna run and hide."
"Patrick"," Seven, eight..."

"Patrick"," OF COURSE! I'm the best hide and seek player ever aren't I?"
"SpongeBob"," Right. Here I go.  One, two, three, four, five, six,seven, eight..."
"Patrick","  Do you hear that? No what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game or something."
"SpongeBob"," Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...  Ninety-nine,  a hundred! Now where is he hiding?

"SpongeBob"," Gasp! Mr. Krabs, did you forget?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Probably."
"SpongeBob"," Tomorrow is ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!"
"Squidward","  Nice.  REAL NICE!"
"SpongeBob"," Umm... Can I buy that patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. Sure."
"SpongeBob"," Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special."
"SpongeBob"," Good idea!  Thanks again Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Whoa, what?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," What, what?!"
"SpongeBob"," We're all out of Krabby Patties!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you check the freezer?!"
"SpongeBob"," I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What about the freezer in the attic?"
"SpongeBob"," We don't have an attic."
"Mr. Krabs"," No attic?!"
"SpongeBob"," You sold it, remember?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah."
"Plankton"," Now what are they saying Karen? Karen?!"
"Plankton"," What? I thought you said you could read lips!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," A fresh batch?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties."
"Plankton"," Okay, now what's he saying?"
"Plankton"," A fresh batch of—ooh, this is good. This is really good!"
"SpongeBob"," When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Plankton"," Okay, what'd he just say?"
"Plankton"," I said, ""What'd he just say?"""
"Plankton"," I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!"
"Plankton"," I know that! Wait... oh, he said, ""What?""."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day."
"SpongeBob"," No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh okay. But make sure he's healthy and clean!"
"Plankton"," Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!"
"SpongeBob"," There you are Gare bear. I brought you some kelp fries.  I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready While you enjoy them.  Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary?  Gary?  Gary?!  Gary, not again come out of there, it's dirty!  Gotcha! Come on Gary, quit messing arou.... "
"SpongeBob","  Great, Gary,just great! Now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not going to come down from there, are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Ugh! you win, we'll bathe you in the morning! "
"Plankton","  Good morning sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of..."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! I'm going to start the bath!"
"Plankton"," Look I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?"
"Plankton"," Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself this could be..."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! The bath is ready!"
"Plankton"," ...all yours! Now I know what your thinking but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course."
"SpongeBob","  Gary! Your bath is ready!"
"Plankton"," Have a pleasant stay! Bon Voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula, and destroy Krabs once and for all!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ha there you are Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for ""Bring your pet to work day""! And today is the day!   First I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
"Plankton"," Wha...? "
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh, smells nice, doesn't it?"
"Plankton"," Ugh..."
"SpongeBob","  Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime! "
"Plankton"," "
"SpongeBob","  Bet that feel good, huh?"
"Plankton","  Curses! I mean... meow?"
"SpongeBob","  Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?"
"Plankton"," I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow! "
"SpongeBob","  Gary! You're turning green! And talking!"
"Plankton"," No I'm not."
"SpongeBob","  We gotta get you to the pet hospital!"
"Plankton"," Pet hospital! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late! Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick.  Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and he's turning green. Is he sick?"
"Plankton","  Meow? "
"SpongeBob"," Is that yes? Or no?"
"Plankton"," Intensive care unit?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Gary. These are proffesionals."
"Plankton","  Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary! "
"SpongeBob"," Please try to save him, doctor!"
"Plankton","  No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I..."
"Plankton"," Whew! That's a relief."
"SpongeBob","  Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," You're-you're saying that he's... that he might... oh...  Nurse? Nurse?! Oh well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end. "
"Plankton"," If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go..."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know it's really poignant."
"Plankton"," What is?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, now that you can talk we're... we're running out of time to say I love you! "
"Plankton","  Oh, boy..."
"SpongeBob","  Just a little further, Gare-bare."
"Plankton"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob","  Buddy, you just stay right here, and daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gary... "
"Plankton"," Yes, Spongefool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!"
"Plankton"," Mommy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton? "
"Plankton"," Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going already!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Mr. Krabs, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer. He's really earning his pay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he takes after you, lad.  Pay?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's comin' up on that time again. Okay, boy, fire her up."
"SpongeBob"," With pleasure, Mr. Krabs.  I love this part of the job."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't forget the cheese."
"SpongeBob"," And this part ain't bad either! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks good, kiddo. You want to do the honors?"
"SpongeBob","  You don't mean..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I mean."
"SpongeBob","  Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day. "
"SpongeBob"," As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open.  Patrons, spring forth.  The Krusty Krab will now seat you. "
"Mr. Krabs","  All right, you landlubbers, get the lead--  Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, ""As The Tide Turns."""
"Squidward"," Shut it SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret."
"Squidward"," I knew it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers! And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy Susans sit around the TV all day."
"Mr. Krabs","  Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'."
"SpongeBob"," You want me to go undercover?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers."
"SpongeBob"," Understood, Mr. Krabs.  How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I don't need a spy."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right."
"SpongeBob"," Well, you'd be mistaken sir because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, stop this nonsense!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone.  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax.  And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon."
"Mr. Krabs"," What about the food?"
"SpongeBob"," I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample."
"SpongeBob"," One of your finest sandwiches, please."
"SpongeBob","  ""Headbands equal no service."" Barnacles! My disguises' only weakness-  Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort!  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel."
"Mr. Krabs"," Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?"
"SpongeBob"," Other than the faux dilapidation, not really."
"Mr. Krabs"," What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?"
"SpongeBob"," No. Great barrier reef!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it, lad? What do you see?"
"SpongeBob"," I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory! "
"Mr. Krabs"," A statue? How does a statue steal me customers?  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er.  Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision..."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Someone among us with a big talent..."
"Squidward"," He's talking about me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?"
"SpongeBob","  I do."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, really? Who?"
"SpongeBob"," Guess."
"Mr. Krabs"," Um, Larry the Lobster?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Old Man Jenkins?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," One-tooth Sally?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," My mom?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then who?"
"Squidward"," For the love of all things briny, it's me!"
"SpongeBob"," Correct."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo."
"Squidward"," For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius."
"SpongeBob"," Word."
"Squidward"," Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Good-bye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both ""make product."""
"Squidward"," Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I don't know, 12?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday."
"Squidward","  All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control."
"Mr. Krabs"," You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow."
"Squidward"," Yes, tom—tomorrow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," As advertised."
"Squidward"," I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 800am."
"Squidward"," I'll need an assistant."
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go. "
"Squidward"," Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece."
"SpongeBob"," Anything for the artiste."
"Squidward"," And don't dilly...  ...dally. Nice rock."
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna be rich."
"Squidward"," I'm gonna be famous."
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher. "
"Squidward"," Prepare to be immortalized in stone."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy."
"Squidward"," I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself?  Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Like this?"
"Squidward"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or this? "
"Squidward"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or this? "
"Squidward"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or this? "
"Squidward"," Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, come on, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Mm.  Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. "
"Mr. Krabs"," How long am I gonna have to stay like this?"
"Squidward"," As long as it takes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!"
"Squidward"," All done. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, let's see it!"
"Squidward"," Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah, just show me. "
"Squidward"," Voila! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that supposed to be?"
"Squidward"," This is a masterpiece."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't have a mouth in my stomach."
"Squidward"," It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Mopression."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?"
"Squidward"," This is art, not a swing set!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Reporting for duty, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy."
"Squidward"," It is not a doohickey, it's art!"
"SpongeBob"," I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear.  Wow, this is heavy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! I can't let kids play on that—that—that weapon. I'm gonna get my pants sued off."
"Squidward"," What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you hear something?  Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?"
"Squidward"," As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. "
"SpongeBob"," I think you look really good, sir. You're golden! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Do you think we caused an earthquake by hitting the ground too hard?"
"Patrick"," Maybe. Or maybe it's those guys. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've never seen those guys around before... "
"Patrick"," Ewwww! We're all covered in slime!"
"SpongeBob"," Not to worry! I am a sponge after all!  Hold still, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're leaking."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you mind? I've gotta wring myself out."
"Patrick"," Say no more. "
"SpongeBob","  Ah! Oh! We've got to warn Bikini Bottom about those creatures!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what do we do?"
"Patrick"," What are those things?"
"SpongeBob"," Whelks? Heh, I'm not afraid of some goofy old sea snails!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hey Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary can be a little bit creepy."
"Patrick"," Well, I'm not afraid of them! Watch this! "
"Patrick","  Wait, hold on a second. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what happened?"
"Patrick"," Can't talk, Running! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Ravenous sea whelks are terrorizing Bikini Bottom! They kinda look like Gary, but not really, and they spit purple slime! And they're eating everyone! They tried to eat me and Patrick, but we ran and we got away!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ravenous?  That means hungry!  Krabby Patties! Get your Krabby Patties! Only 3.99 each!  That'll be 54.95.  Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh? Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!"
"Patrick","  Spon... Spo... Spo...!"
"SpongeBob"," Use your words, Patrick!  Squid... Squi... Squi... Squi...!"
"Squidward"," Yep, that's one angry mama."
"Mr. Krabs"," Welcome to The Krusty Krab!   You seem to be a mollusk of deserting taste. Could I introduce you to a side of Kelp Fries?  Hey! I'm not on the menu!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, it swallowed Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward"," And this affects me, how? "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are we going to do? "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob? Patrick?"
"Sandy"," How can I be sure you're not whelks in disguise?"
"SpongeBob"," We're not whelks! We're not whelks!"
"Sandy","  What's your mom's maiden name?"
"SpongeBob"," Eeh, BubbleBottom!"
"Sandy"," Patrick, what's your first name?"
"Patrick"," Uh, is this a trick question?"
"Sandy","  You're in.  I think I have the answer! Now, do ya want the regular answer, or the ACTION PACKED answer?!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, action packed, please?"
"Sandy"," Yes!  I need a sample of their slime! If I can analyze it, I might be deduce the cause of their behavior! And maybe we can stop them!"
"Sandy","  Oh, no!"
"Sandy"," Come on, guys! Follow me! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess this is end, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," You guys go, I'll hold them off.  And if I failed, at least my sacrifice will be delayable!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't let you do that, Patrick! I'll be the one to delay my life!"
"Patrick"," Okay, you go!"
"Sandy"," No, I'll go! The whelks don't seem to be after land critters! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look!"
"SpongeBob"," The gang's all here!"
"Squidward"," We're closed. Come back tomorrow."
"Sandy","  Hey, SpongeBob! Lend me your corneas for a second! You too, Patrick!"
"Sandy","  Well, golly! No wonder they're all grumpy! Them whelks are full of germs! They're sicker than a bull with the squirrel pox!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I know what to do! After all, I've had the suds! I just have to absorb the whelks' snot, and they'll return to normal! "
"SpongeBob"," Now, let's get the rest of you cleaned! "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, cute. Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhhh... Chhoooooo!  Excuse me! "
"Squidward"," Gesundheit."
"Mr. Krabs"," You did it, boy!"
"Squidward","  So, these things went crazy just because they had the sniffles? "
"Patrick"," It's in his eye! "
"Squidward"," Oh, so hilarious."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Can you two be quiet?!"
"Squidward"," Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing. "
"Patrick"," And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem. "
"Squidward"," Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?"
"SpongeBob"," It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine.  Simple-Ton A ton of simple things to do!"
"Squidward"," It must very challenging for you!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it is."
"Patrick"," Yeah, and it made me look more smart-like.  What does the magazine say we should do next?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's take a look.  We've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!"
"Squidward"," Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society. "
"Squidward","  Morons. "
"SpongeBob"," You go first, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, no. After you, old buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Au contraire. After you, mon amie."
"Patrick"," Please. After you, pal."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend-  -Oof!"
"Squidward","  Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll go first.  Question 1 What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........Aquamarine!"
"Patrick"," I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you."
"SpongeBob"," No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed."
"Patrick","  How did you know?"
"SpongeBob"," Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!"
"Patrick"," Aww!"
"SpongeBob"," Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?"
"Patrick","  No peeking!"
"SpongeBob","  No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed!  You haaaaaaaaaave..."
"Patrick"," Oh! What will his answer be?"
"Squidward","  The suspense is killing me!"
"SpongeBob"," ...an innie!"
"Patrick"," Well, let's just check that theory!  Innie!  Wow! How does he do it?"
"Squidward","  Magic. "
"Patrick"," My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered."
"SpongeBob"," Okay! First question What is your best friend's favorite color?"
"Patrick"," Aw, man! Pulled out the big guns. Color. Color."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," No, no! No hints!  Blue! No, clear! No!  That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14."
"SpongeBob"," The answer is...beige."
"Patrick"," Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close."
"SpongeBob"," Question 2 Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?"
"Patrick","  Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous! "
"Patrick"," Oh, fish paste!"
"SpongeBob"," Next question Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?"
"Patrick"," Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie. "
"Patrick"," Tartar sauce!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?"
"Patrick"," Uh..."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!"
"SpongeBob","  No."
"Patrick"," I thought for sure I had that one."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?"
"Patrick"," Ooh. That's a toughie.  Hmm. Rugged biceps.  Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, last question!"
"Patrick","  Ooh! This is for the win!"
"SpongeBob"," What shape is your best friend?"
"Patrick"," Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?"
"SpongeBob"," What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?"
"Patrick"," Round, flat, uh, hexagon."
"SpongeBob"," SQUARE-pants."
"Patrick"," Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!"
"SpongeBob","  Five seconds."
"Patrick","  Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis..."
"SpongeBob"," Time's up! "
"Patrick"," TRIANGLE!!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, no."
"Squidward"," Idiots, wrecking my boat."
"Squidward"," So, who won your stupid quiz?"
"Patrick"," It was a tie."
"Squidward","  Let me see that.  a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you!  And he's supposed to be your best friend?"
"Patrick"," I know, it's like we're not friends at all!"
"SpongeBob"," Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right Patrick?  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Ice cream!"
"Squidward"," Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream. "
"SpongeBob","  thank you best friend, Patrick."
"Patrick"," It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla."
"Patrick"," Oh, right.  Well, more ice cream for me!"
"Patrick"," Oh, can I borrow five bucks?"
"SpongeBob"," Here! Take your dirty, rotten money!  Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! "
"Patrick"," I guess he didn't want any ice cream."
"SpongeBob"," It just isn't fair!  Oh, who needs Patrick anyway?  Rest of my life, here I come! "
"Patrick"," Oh hey there, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. "
"Patrick"," See you later!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!"
"Sandy"," You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Sandy"," Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! "
"Sandy","  What a crybaby."
"SpongeBob"," I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself!  I can go jellyfishing!  Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog!  I can blow bubbles!  Uh, maybe not. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's Patrick! I can led him see me!  Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all.  Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick works out at the gym?  And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back! "
"SpongeBob","  Hold it right there, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," We were just coming to see you."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'll bet you were, to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!"
"Patrick"," While Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks."
"SpongeBob"," I know, he is pretty amazing..."
"Patrick"," He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present."
"SpongeBob","  Who for? Sandy?"
"Patrick"," No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants. "
"SpongeBob"," Really?  For me? What is it?  Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!"
"Patrick","  I got a pair for me too! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick!  How do I look?"
"Patrick","  How should I know, mysterious stranger?!? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Pearl!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend. "
"Patrick","  I didn't know you had a girlfriend."
"Patrick"," That was fast.  Don't worry buddy, there's plenty of fish in the street car."
"SpongeBob"," Bye Pearl! Tell Mr. Krabs I said ""Hi,"" Let's bounce Patrick. Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Busy, I'll catch up with you later."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I'm a single rider!  Excuse me, Pardon me, Excuse me, Pardon me, Excuse me, Pardon me!"
"SpongeBob","  After you, fellow single rider Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","   I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
"SpongeBob"," And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!!!"
"SpongeBob"," You're supposed to remain seated until the ride comes to a COMPLEEE-  Stop! "
"Patrick","  Oh No!! I'm out of coral on a stick!  Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!"
"Patrick","  This is my worst nightmare!! I don't have a drink!"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," You mean SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," I'm coming SpongeBob!"
"Patrick","  My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!"
"Patrick"," Fine!  Well mister police guy won't let me in the front huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!"
"Patrick"," Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be?  Aha!  Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend!  Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you buddy!  SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh there you are!  Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles!  You're okay now buddy! Go to your happy place! ."
"SpongeBob"," It's okay Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for. Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS."
"SpongeBob"," PEARL!!! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... SNAKES!!!"
"SpongeBob","  Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire ba..bat fish, and sharks ,and..."
"SpongeBob"," ...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES! "
"SpongeBob","  Or ghostly pirates!   Or laboratory creatures!"
"SpongeBob","  Or green beings from another planet!"
"SpongeBob","  Or bus drivers!"
"SpongeBob"," Shhh. Did you hear that?"
"SpongeBob"," It sounded like a crawly were-clown."
"SpongeBob"," Oh he's here."
"SpongeBob"," A ha ha ha, he."
"Patrick"," Not another skunk! How did you beat me again?  Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey I am talking towards you."
"Patrick"," I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I know you kidnapped SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done."
"Patrick"," Geez. Some people are so pushy. "
"Patrick"," Oops. "
"Patrick"," You told me to sit on it."
"SpongeBob"," What was that?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!"
"Patrick"," Okay, Okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! How romantical."
"SpongeBob"," Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub.  Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil! "
"Patrick","  Nice facilities. Great water pressure. "
"SpongeBob"," What's that? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob","  CRAWLY CLOWN!!! CRAWLY CLOWN!!!"
"Patrick"," Are you gonna finish that?"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh...delicious!!"
"SpongeBob"," Top of the morning to ya!  Krusty Krab! SpongeBob speaking!  Gary? Is that you?  Gary, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing!  Oooh! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not impressed..."
"SpongeBob"," I made it with leftover ingredients."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now I'm impressed!"
"Squidward","  Sigh...Once in awhile, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life...Talking to myself...again..."
"SpongeBob","  And then I just cook it like this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Go on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why? Would you like to buy one?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What 'bout double?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what's that noise?"
"Squidward"," Excruciating..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Up here boys! Take a look!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't read it from here, Mr. Krabs! What's it say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It says ""Krusty Dogs, only $3.99! Or $4.99 with cheese!"
"Squidward"," $4.99!? That's highway robbery!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Avec fromage, Monsieur Squidward! Avec fromage!"
"SpongeBob","  My Krusty Dog! Handwritten on the menu! Oh, pinch me Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Pinch yourself you ninny."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye Captain! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Mr. Krabs! We sure are gettin' a lot of orders for Krusty Dogs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yep!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll get those going after I finish cooking up these Krabby Patties!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, forget about making those Patties! Just make the wieners! "
"SpongeBob"," Just make the wieners?  Um, excuse me Mr. Krabs? Uh, w-where are you going with that ladder? Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu. That's all!"
"SpongeBob"," Changes...?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that reminds me! Do you have an eraser I could borrow?"
"SpongeBob"," E-raser?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off.  No more Krabby Patties!"
"SpongeBob","  No more Krabby… patties..."
"SpongeBob"," No more Krabby paddy…"
"SpongeBob"," I had this horrible dream. That Mr. Krabs would never let me cook Krabby Patties again. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pardon me."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Wake up. "
"SpongeBob","  Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're back in yer old kitchen. And the paramedics were here to revive ye."
"SpongeBob"," I was asleep?"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, isn't that where the grill used to be? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe. But now we have this! "
"SpongeBob"," And what about my… my spatula? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I got'cha a new one! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, captain. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, can I talk to you for 1 second?"
"Squidward"," I don't know. That's a pretty long talk. "
"SpongeBob"," Has anything ever happened at your job that… well, made it not-as-fun as it used to be?"
"Squidward"," Actually, yes."
"SpongeBob"," Really?! What was it? "
"Squidward"," Being hired. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know why, but  things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning, that it already is. "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy SpongeBob! How's go the wieners?"
"SpongeBob"," Eh, I was kinda wondering… could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever boy!"
"SpongeBob"," I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place its name."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yea, good point."
"SpongeBob"," Yea! Don't' you think we should…  Krusty Dogs?! Those wieners have got to go!"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes!  Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition."
"SpongeBob","  Here's your footlong, sir! "
"SpongeBob"," Yea! You know what gives them that added flavor?"
"SpongeBob","   Nose hair and recycled dental floss."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," We have got to get rid of these wieners and being back the Krabby Patty!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but, count me in!"
"SpongeBob"," Hurray!"
"Squidward","  Help! I'm having horrible abdominal pain! I think it was the… the…  Line."
"SpongeBob"," Wiener "
"Squidward"," The wiener!"
"SpongeBob","  Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a simple, old timey gentlemen. I came here for 1 purpose today."
"SpongeBob"," QUIET GRANNY! I'M TALKING!"
"SpongeBob"," And that is to loudly decry these modern, new fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that didn't work at all."
"Squidward"," It only seems to increase their appetite for wieners."
"SpongeBob"," We need stronger tactics. "
"Squidward"," Right, something that would make Mr. Krabs' whole wiener thing blow right up in his face! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, blow up.  Squidward, that's it! "
"SpongeBob","  Beautiful."
"SpongeBob","  Your Krusty Dog sir, with extra mustard. "
"SpongeBob"," Can I bring you something else?  Okay, I guess not. Thank you sir. "
"SpongeBob","  Wait for it SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now! "
"SpongeBob"," Have a nice day! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?"
"SpongeBob"," Oooh! I know the answer."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward? "
"SpongeBob"," I think he's outside on his break."
"Mr. Krabs"," Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, captain! "
"Squidward"," . "
"Squidward"," Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating."
"Patrick"," You're it!"
"SpongeBob"," Not for long!"
"Patrick"," Hey, try to catch me, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Tag, you're it."
"Patrick"," Oh, this game's too hard!"
"SpongeBob"," I know! What if both of us are ""it?"""
"Patrick"," But then, who's gonna be not ""it?"""
"SpongeBob"," Exactly! Neither of us will know!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I like not knowing! Let's play!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm it!"
"Patrick"," I'm it!  SpongeBob!  Hang on, buddy, I'm coming! Ahhhh! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, what is this place?"
"Patrick"," Look at all this cool stuff!  I'm the captain!  Yo, ho, ho, ya mateys! Arr!  Got ya! En garde!  Thanks, SpongeBob. I guess we better be more careful."
"SpongeBob"," Let's go back to the main deck."
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!  I'm coming, buddy! Patrick?  Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Ooh, shiny and smooth. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, what's this?  Mauna Loa.  Oh, I'm late! Gotta get to work! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Mauna Loa, how I love ya, oh, my secret lovin' hideaway! My Mauna Loa bay-a bay!♪"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob! What are you doing? I've been saying I needed a Krabby Patty about a bajillion times! And you w— What the...? Ha, ha, ha! Nice patty, Michelangelo! Ha!  I hope you're not expecting an award anytime soon. Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's just my secret—  Here you go."
"Squidward"," Porous freak."
"SpongeBob"," Whew, that was a close one!"
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob, check out the new t-shirt I just made!  Secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hide—"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, please! What are you trying to do?! Give away our secret hideout?! Give me that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's all the racket?!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, sorry, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick, if you're going to distract me fry cook, the least you can do is buy some grub!"
"Patrick"," You got it, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Back to work, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing.  Arr! Oh, looks like the work day's over. See you tomorrow, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's odd. "
"Patrick"," Hmm, well, let's see."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. We've got to get back to our playground."
"Patrick"," Keep the change, my good man!"
"Squidward","  Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says ""Mauna Loa""."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mauna Loa?! As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa? Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies in a truance. I have been searching for this treasure during me entire adult life. Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every denture. Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!"
"Squidward"," Well, I guess that explains this. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves. Come on, Squidward. We got to let those two dingalings lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!"
"Squidward"," Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but have fun with that."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?"
"Patrick"," Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?"
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?"
"Patrick"," No. It's just a secret that everybody knows about.  What's wrong, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Just as I thought. We're being followed. That's it!  Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Found it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, were you following us?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No. I just saw the sign."
"Mr. Krabs"," So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr. Krabs, did ya?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?!  You're a stonewall, eh? We'll see about that!  Where'd you two blunders find the gold coin?"
"SpongeBob"," If my eyes weren't burning like they were full of lava, I could show you."
"Mr. Krabs","  Heh, jokers."
"Mr. Krabs","  I knew I'd find it! Check it out, fellas, cool, hard doubloons!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, you might want to take a closer look at your coinage."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh? What's this? ""Token Has No Monetary Value?"" Tokens?! This must be a decoy. "
"SpongeBob"," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Maybe they hid the loot off ship in that shed!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Whee-hee! What the barnacle? Well, it's just full of tickets!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ticket booth?!"
"SpongeBob"," And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?"
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Must Be This Tall To Ride?"""
"Patrick"," Well, maybe they had something against short people. I like their little clothes."
"SpongeBob"," Captain's Quarters. There must be some treasure here, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Out of me way, boy.  I knew it. The lost treasure of the Mauna Loa is finally mine! I can practically taste them jewels.  It's a little lighter than I thought. Huh? It's empty.  No good. Ha, ha, very clever, captain. Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens? It's not the Wreck of the Mauna Loa, It's ""The Wreck of the Mauna Loa"" amusement park ride! "
"Patrick"," No wonder we were so amused!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'm not!"
"SpongeBob"," Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout."
"Mr. Krabs"," This place ain't got no treasure! Keep your worthless hunk of junk!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun.  Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas. Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!"
"Squidward","  Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa. Arr. How may I help you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Step right up, don't be shy! Experience the amusement and terror of The Wreck of the Mauna Loa!"
"Mr. Krabs","  That's right, folks! We spare no expect to restore this plastic ship to its former glory!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho-ho, I disagree. I'd say the little  feller's just right. "
"SpongeBob"," It's gone, Patrick. Our secret paradise is gone forever! "
"Patrick"," And alas, even the joyous shrieks of children cannot lift my sunken heart!"
"SpongeBob"," How 'bout another ride to cheer you up?"
"Patrick"," Let's do this!"
"SpongeBob"," That was awesome!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Totally realistic!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What—what—what are you talking about? You can't take me to the pokey! I—"
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, I guess we really lost our secret hideout this time."
"Patrick"," And just when everyone was starting to find out about it, too."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, who knows, Patrick? The next fun, fun place might be just around the corner, huh?"
"Patrick"," Well, I doubt it."
"SpongeBob"," ""The Real Mauna Loa?"" Ooh, Patrick, do you want to keep a secret?"
"Patrick","  Nope!"
"Squidward","  It's finally complete!  After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends,  literally,  my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed!  NO!  Now, I'm flummoxed.  Drggh. "
"SpongeBob"," Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it.  Perfect "
"SpongeBob"," Good Job Patrick."
"Squidward"," Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!"
"Patrick","  Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?"
"Squidward","  No.  As I was saying, you two... "
"Patrick"," Or see?"
"Squidward"," No!"
"Patrick","  How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?"
"Squidward"," Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?"
"SpongeBob"," We were just posting Patrick's new ""For Rent"" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see? "
"Squidward"," For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?"
"SpongeBob","  No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard."
"Patrick"," Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?"
"Squidward"," Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?"
"Patrick"," First come, first, serve."
"Squidward"," Oh great, now another idiot can move in."
"SpongeBob"," Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers."
"Squidward"," Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thanks!"
"Squidward"," Oh no, I'm sorry I can't."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, why not?"
"Squidward"," It's because I was planning to do ""No such thing""! See?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks. "
"Squidward"," With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and...  ...quiet.  Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were...  Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise."
"Squidward"," Hello, Howard."
"Squidward"," Sorry, you're too late."
"Squidward"," Aren't we all?"
"Squidward","  Passions?"
"Squidward"," The bassoon?"
"Squidward","  I can't believe what I am hearing.  Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! "
"Squidward","  Wait! Don't go!' ' I was...just kidding!"
"Squidward"," Wow, his designs are impeccable!  Yes, I do feel ""at home""."
"Squidward"," To a new neighbor! "
"Squidward","  Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors."
"Squidward"," Well, that's nice!"
"Squidward"," Well, that's nice."
"Squidward"," Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! "
"Patrick"," Spongebob, look!"
"Squidward"," Try reading the sign, Casanova."
"Squidward","  Even the illiterate are finding love.  Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance? "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!  You dropped your ook!"
"Squidward"," That's no ""ook"". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way forever."
"SpongeBob"," Don't be sad, buddy. Turn that frown upside down! "
"Squidward"," I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation. "
"SpongeBob","  Just remember, Squidward. You have never experienced true love. BUT that doesn't mean you will never find it! You know the saying There's a squid for every pot!"
"Squidward"," Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward.  That'll make me feel better."
"Squidward","  Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da...  She's, wow!"
"Squidward","  She speaks art jargon!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace,  and looks only matched by yours truly!"
"SpongeBob"," Well why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?"
"Squidward"," My next move exactly! Observe the old Tentacles charm in all its glory! "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, you are floundering up there!"
"Squidward"," I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before."
"SpongeBob","  Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!"
"Squidward"," She's talking to me. What do I do?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!"
"Squidward"," You!? You don't know the first thing about the fine art of romance!"
"Squidward","  She's leaving!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day.  I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am. Right Squidward?"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say ""Hello."""
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know."
"SpongeBob"," That's right! We are talking some serious credentials."
"SpongeBob"," The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress."
"SpongeBob"," You betcha! He's such a charmer."
"Squidward","  Don't forget artistic and musical."
"SpongeBob"," Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too. "
"SpongeBob"," But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 800 sound, Squilvia?"
"Squidward"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," You okay, buddy. You froze up there, buddy."
"Squidward","  What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob"," I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, you' gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?"
"SpongeBob"," You my friend are in desperate need of a practice date."
"Squidward"," That's it! I'll go on...  a practice date? I don't get it."
"SpongeBob"," Just meet me at my house at 5 00, Squidward."
"SpongeBob","  Just one minute, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Sometime today would be nice."
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready!"
"Squidward","  Dear Neptune!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh!  Missed a spot!  Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?"
"Squidward"," Um...You look...stunning?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?"
"Squidward"," What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have."
"Squidward","  Oh, but I wanted to!"
"SpongeBob"," No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller...  ...very allergic to tulips. So, are you ready to go?"
"Squidward"," Go where?"
"SpongeBob"," To dinner, silly."
"Squidward"," Oh, right! I'll get my car.  Hop in!  What?"
"SpongeBob","  A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady."
"Squidward","  Oh, where are my manners!?  Alrighty, so...  Can I help you with that?"
"SpongeBob"," No, no, I've got it!"
"Squidward","  There!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, snug."
"Squidward"," Can we go now?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Good."
"SpongeBob"," Right after I tinkle. "
"Squidward"," Can we go now?"
"SpongeBob"," Great, I know a fabulous place! Just head this way."
"Squidward"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," At that stop sign make a right."
"Squidward"," Alright."
"SpongeBob"," At that stoplight make a right."
"Squidward"," Gotcha."
"SpongeBob"," At this street here make a right. At this intersection make a right, and park at the orange building up ahead. Ooh! We're here!"
"Squidward"," You're a real piece of work, you know that?"
"SpongeBob"," Why thank you, Mr. Squidward!  Way to compliment the date, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation."
"Squidward"," Oh... Um... Chit-chat... Can you believe all this weather we're having?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, good effort, but you want to try something more personal. A woman may want to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give to the nail salon. "
"Squidward"," Urrgh!"
"Patrick","  Dinner is served."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I'm famished!  Don't try to eat it. It's plastic."
"SpongeBob"," This is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, could you please pass the roasted kelp? "
"Patrick","  Here you go, ma'am!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, thank you, sir!"
"Patrick"," Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady sitting across from you? I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!"
"Squidward"," Oh, no you don't, Patrick! You cannot just barge across like this! SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!!"
"Patrick","  So, do you hang out here often?"
"SpongeBob","  Well, this is my home, silly."
"Squidward"," Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?  Which, by the way begins in five minutes. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, wait! We haven't covered... We haven't covered all the tenants of Dating 101 yet!  So, as I was saying... I, I would like to go over just a few more crucial aspects of the first date.  Such as..."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Squidward.."
"Squidward"," Don't ""um, Squidward"" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be."
"SpongeBob"," Does this mean there won't be a second date?"
"Squidward"," Um, you just saw that, didn't you?"
"Squidward"," And you probably think I'm a mean-spirited brute, which, ironically, is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?"
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!"
"SpongeBob"," Have fun you two! SquarePants, your work here is done."
"Patrick","  Not quite! I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn."
"SpongeBob","  "
"Patrick"," ♪Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!♪"
"SpongeBob"," Hey buddy, what are you cleaning for?"
"Patrick"," Cause I'm expecting some very important company."
"SpongeBob"," Who's that?"
"Patrick"," My big sister, Sam!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!"
"Patrick","  Nobody does.  I lost her in the surf when we were kids."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I'm sorry Patrick."
"Patrick"," Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock! "
"SpongeBob"," It's gonna be ok... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!"
"Patrick"," Thanks man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!"
"Squidward","  Would you two pipe down!"
"Patrick"," Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister."
"Squidward"," Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you. "
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," ...Sam!"
"Patrick"," Sis!"
"Patrick"," It's so good to see you."
"Patrick"," Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back."
"Patrick"," I cleaned my rock just for you. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Lets go inside and play."
"Patrick"," Hey great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Oh dear Neptune didn't you hear me- "
"Patrick"," Thanks sis!"
"Squidward"," Well make rock some where else. My house is full of sand."
"Squidward"," This is way beyond my property line. Hey Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor."
"SpongeBob"," No no don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, Don't you Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Oh I mean it alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward, you jokester."
"Squidward"," Do you think she looks a little...miffed?"
"Patrick"," Shame on you two! Look what you've done!"
"Squidward"," Look what we've done?!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Awwww hey sis, don't listen to those...meanies. Hey the new rock is looking kinda...boring. What do you say we decorate it?"
"Patrick"," You can call it whatever you like sis as long as we make it spiffy!"
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Hey you can't do that, that's my window!"
"Patrick"," That's the spirit, Sis."
"Squidward"," Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit Patrick. Your sister is out of control!"
"Patrick"," Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!"
"Squidward"," You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it! "
"Squidward"," But that's from...  my house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!"
"Patrick"," How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things..."
"SpongeBob"," Easy now gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?"
"Patrick"," No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well! "
"SpongeBob"," It's not like that at all Patrick. I was just-"
"Patrick"," Come on sis they won't bother us under our rock."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward...wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them."
"Squidward"," The time for talk is over. now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't think you should do that."
"Squidward"," Who cares what you think?! if it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get! "
"SpongeBob"," Now Sam it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy."
"SpongeBob"," Please don't."
"SpongeBob"," Well Squidward at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?"
"Squidward"," Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!"
"Patrick"," Your still my rock big sis."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?"
"SpongeBob"," She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!"
"Patrick"," Well I guess she can get a little carried away."
"Patrick"," Well uh...well...well it's about your temper Sam."
"Patrick"," Not the rock! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? "
"Patrick","  Cookie Dough!"
"Patrick"," Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!"
"Patrick"," Bye sis."
"Patrick"," Isn't my sister something?"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, she's something alright! "
"Sandy","  Almost done... Could you hand me that wrench, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Nu uh uh! Lab Partner!"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," You called me SpongeBob. I thought we agreed to address each other by our proper titles."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh ta ta ta! Lab Partner!"
"Sandy"," There! It's finished! Now I can hide my nuts back in Texas without leavin' my lab!"
"Sandy","  It worked! Hooray! "
"SpongeBob"," We did it!"
"Sandy"," Aw, nuts!"
"Plankton"," Finally! The day has come!"
"Plankton"," No! It's the day I steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from Krabs!"
"Plankton","  Because today I have completed my greatest invention. Behold! "
"Plankton"," This is no ordinary vegetable steamer, Karen, my computer wife. It's my latest invention! And isn't she a beauty. Meow. "
"Plankton"," Sweetie, you're going to help me achieve my defined purpose, aren't you, yes? And steal the Krabby Patty recipe! Muhahahahaha!  It's ready!  Oh, boy.  Whew! Man, is it hot in here."
"Plankton","  It worked! In this new gaseous form, I will be able to silently squeeze through the cracks of the Krusty Krab. Ehahahahaha!"
"Plankton"," Hehehehe!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, how much is that- Mr. Krabs gets cut off by Plankton going through his eyes.  Eugh!"
"Plankton"," Finally, the moment has come!  No, No, No!  NNNOOOOO!!! "
"Sandy","  Eugh. "
"Plankton"," Hey! Cut it out!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton? is that you?"
"Plankton"," Of course it's me, you moron."
"Sandy"," You were able to convert yourself into gaseous form? Facinatin'!"
"Plankton"," Huh? Wait!"
"Sandy"," I guess I never realized you were such a student of science. Maybe you could help me fix my nut transporter."
"Plankton"," Eh? Did you say transporter?  Interesting.  Hey! Maybe if I combine this device with my own invention, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! I mean, I think I have the right parts in my lab, maybe?"
"Sandy"," We're in business!  Say! This is a dandy lab!"
"Plankton"," Is that good?"
"Plankton"," I guess..."
"Plankton"," Haha, yes."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. The lab is amazing."
"Plankton"," Do you really like it?"
"Sandy"," And how! "
"SpongeBob"," Here's your teleporter, lab partner."
"Sandy","  Thanks, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Can you please call me lab partner?"
"Sandy"," So where do I hook up my teleporter?"
"Plankton"," Oh, just plug it into that doohickey over there "
"Sandy"," Wowee! Is that a real mark-3 surplus wifeomatic? She is beautiful."
"Plankton"," No, not that doohickey. THIS doohickey! Just plug your teleporter into my device, and with our combined power we shall conquer the world! "
"Sandy"," Uh huh. Or I can combine your gasifier with my invention and transform my nuts into a gaseous cloud that transports them back to Texas!"
"Plankton"," Heh. Yes, that's what I meant."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I guess you won't be needing me any more. "
"Plankton"," That's right. And don't let the door hit you on the way out!"
"Sandy"," Hold on! You can't go, SpongeBob. We need you."
"Plankton"," What! He'll just get in the way!"
"SpongeBob"," Need me?  How could I help? I'm not even a  scientist."
"Sandy"," Why, you'll have the most important job of all! You'll be our test monkey."
"SpongeBob","  Test monkey,  Test monkey reporting for duty!"
"Plankton"," A test monkey?  I...I've never had a test monkey before!  There is some mad scientist in you after all! Muhahahaha!  Ok, we really have to work on your evil laugh. "
"Sandy"," Ready!"
"Plankton"," Roger!  Urgh! Just a sec. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Who turned out the lights?"
"Sandy"," Eugh! We only teleported his eyes!"
"Plankton"," Oh, boy. Try again!"
"Squidward"," Where is that idiot SpongeBob, leaving me stuck with all the cooking? This job stinks!  Eugh. Literally.  Mr. Krabs!  You gotta come with me! There's something in the kitchen you gotta see! "
"Sandy"," Oh, well.  Try again. "
"Squidward"," See for yourself! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Eugh! I see. So it was you that befouled me office earlier, was it? "
"Sandy"," Just a few more adjustments..."
"Plankton"," Ok. Let her rip!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you think this is a good look for me? Or is it too flashy?"
"Sandy","  Stand clear!"
"SpongeBob"," Clear of what? "
"Squidward"," Something weird is going on around here "
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs! There's a strange sound coming from the restroom! "
"Sandy"," Hm. Now only his mouth is missing."
"Plankton"," Shut it down.  "
"Sandy"," Test 3! "
"Squidward"," I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself.  What the-  Oh, thank you. "
"SpongeBob"," Look, no hands! Or feet. "
"Sandy"," Well, we're getting closer.  Goggles!"
"Plankton"," Shall we activate it together?"
"Sandy"," Why, sure enough! Three!"
"Plankton"," Two!"
"Sandy"," One!"
"Plankton","  Fire!  Ow. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom. "
"Sandy","  It worked! We transported his whole body this time!"
"Plankton"," Yes! My plan worked! And now I have no further use for you two goody goodies!  Using your technology, I shall teleport myself directly to the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty formula  will be mine!  "
"SpongeBob","  Oh no! Plankton has finally won! And we, we helped him."
"Sandy"," Not exactly, Lab Partner. "
"SpongeBob","  The Krabby Patty formula! But if that's here, then where's Plankton? "
"Plankton"," Fools! I played them like a 32 bit synthesizer! Muhahaha! Now where's that formula?  The formula is gone?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you hear something?"
"Squidward","  I don't hear a thing, but something stinks. "
"Sandy"," Aw, I knew Plankton was hatching an evil plan the whole time. So I just adjusted the controls to put Plankton where he can't do any harm. Nobody fools a squirrel from Texas!  AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny.  What the...?!  What in Neptune's knickers is this?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward.  Well, he's at his post right over the...  Where's me cashier?!  SpongeBob!! Where in Poseidon's pantyhoes is that sorry excuse for a cashier?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry excuse for a cash-?"" Oooooh! You mean Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!"
"SpongeBob"," He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring...  ...complete privacy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oooooh. He requires , does he?  What's all the ruckus?!  Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible!  Are you hurt?"
"Squidward"," Oh, well. Thank you for ask-"
"Mr. Krabs"," I wasn't talking to you!  Don't worry, papa's here. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs?  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!!  Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't even know you had ankles."
"Squidward"," As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job."
"Mr. Krabs"," Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean..."
"SpongeBob"," It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines."
"Mr. Krabs"," Substantial fines?!  You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know. "
"Squidward"," Really? Maybe I should give them a call. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid! "
"SpongeBob"," First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker,  for I am certified."
"Squidward"," Oh, no no no, don't touch me!  SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure. "
"Squidward"," Ow!  Get away from me!!!  Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask."
"Squidward"," Hmm? Anything? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now if you want anything, just ask. "
"Squidward"," I could sure use a pillow."
"Plankton","  Hahaha! You failed! I've finally stolen a Krabby Patty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's nice. "
"Plankton"," Aren'tcha gonna try and take it back from me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, goodness no. You go ahead. Take it."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, Plankton will figure out the Krabby Patty formula."
"Mr. Krabs","  Nonsense.  Run along little fella. Enjoy your Krabby Patty."
"Plankton"," Wow, you must've snapped Krabs.  The Krabby Patty formula is finally mine!  What happened? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, just a little security measure I've been working on. Now all Krabby Patties self-destruct 10 feet beyond the Krusty Krab! Sucker!"
"Plankton"," Aw, man . I stole the Krabby Patty fair and square."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, poor wittle baby waby. Does wittle Pwanksy wanksy need his nappy wappy? "
"SpongeBob"," Why are you two always fighting? You were best palsie-walsies once. "
"Plankton"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Can't you two make up and be friends."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeeh, those day are over, SpongeBob."
"Plankton"," Ooo... Krabs and I are bitter enemies!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And that's the way we like it. "
"SpongeBob"," If only there was some way to bring you two back together."
"Plankton"," Forget it, SpongeBob. Nothin' will make me friend with Eugene Krabs.  What is that delicious smell!?"
"SpongeBob"," Bluh! That doesn't smell delicious!"
"Plankton"," No, not that. It's coming from this way.  Aha. That delectable odor is coming from that shack.  Must know more."
"SpongeBob"," The Flabby Patty?"
"Plankton"," Another restaurant. Looks like Krabs has some real competition, huh. Interesting."
"Plankton"," That was fantastic!  Forget the Krabby formula. I must have the Flabby Patty recipe. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, I have great news!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The bank is handing out free samples of money?"
"SpongeBob"," Nooo. There's a new restaurant down the street called the Flabby Patty, and now Plankton only wants to steal their recipe. Isn't that wonderful?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What!? Some imitation patty is tryin' to steal me business? Oh, but me customers are loyal.  They won't leave for some nasty Flabby Patty.  The Flabby Patty shack has stolen all me customers!"
"Plankton"," Get used to it, Krabs. Your Krabby Patty is old news. Once I steal the Flabby Patty recipe your customers will be eating at the Chum Bucket."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no they won't, because I'll steal the Flabby Patty recipe first!"
"Plankton"," Hey, stealin' recipes it my shtick. You haven't got a chance against me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! I bet I get that recipe way before you."
"Plankton"," Bet ya don't!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Bet I will!"
"Plankton"," Won't!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Will!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, whoa, whoa now. Instead of competing, why don't you cooperate and steal the recipe together."
"Plankton","  You're a loser Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Same to you!"
"Plankton","  Sweet Flabby Patty, here I come! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Dig, SpongeBob, dig."
"SpongeBob"," I'm digging, Mr. Krabs, I'm digging. "
"Plankton","  I've so got the drop on that dunderhead Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think we're here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Recipe thievin' is as easy as pie."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, pie. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Where are you hiding?  Ooo, there you are my sweetie."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, do you hear something?  I gotcha, Mr. Krabs. I gotcha!  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Grandma."
"Plankton"," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Ow! Owuhhh."
"Mr. Krabs","  That'll show hi-- "
"SpongeBob","  Don't you see? If you work together, the Flabby Patty recipe would be yours."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll never work with that melignorant microbe."
"Plankton"," Look what that skin flint did to my antennae."
"Mr. Krabs"," I've heard all I'm gonna hear from the likes of you. "
"Plankton"," You'll be hearin' from my lawyer is what you'll be hearin'! "
"Plankton","  Stand aside, restaurant critic coming through!"
"Plankton"," I'm a restaurant critic, so I get cutsies."
"Plankton","  I get to cut in line, so move aside. Move aside!  What is this world coming to when a fake restaurant critic can't get cutsies?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, so here's the plan. I want you to--  I'm sorry, do you mind?  Let's go some place more private.  Once I stand in line I want you to--  Waitin' in line here. That's all."
"SpongeBob","  Hello? I--I have an announcement to make!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooo, and announcement. We should listen. It might save your lives."
"SpongeBob","  I need to-- I'm okay.  The fish hooks are coming!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Brilliant work laddie.  Hey, how come you're not trampled. "
"Plankton","  That fool Krabs, he blew it again!  Now to steal the recipe.  Aha! There it is, and it isn't even guarded.  Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks like you blew it again, Plankton."
"Plankton"," I did better than you, Eugene!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Says who?"
"SpongeBob","  Now, now, I think we all need to calm down. Fighting is pointless. You two would have the recipe by now if you only worked together."
"Mr. Krabs","  Okay, fine.  We'll work together."
"Plankton"," Yeah, I don't see that workin' out."
"SpongeBob"," Not to worry gentlemen. I have a plan.  Oh, yeah, perfect."
"Mr. Krabs"," We look ridiculous. Nobody's gonna buy this disguise."
"Plankton","  I agree.  This is a horrible idea. "
"SpongeBob"," See? You guys are agreeing already. That's the first step to cooperation. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, what's your stupid plan anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," Look over there. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Little more. Little more."
"SpongeBob"," The Flabby Patty is hiring. If you can get the job, the recipe is yours."
"Plankton","  Why am I on the bottom?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop whining! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, I'm here to steal—no—darn...I mean, apply for a job. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes! The recipe is mine!"
"Plankton"," Not so fast, Krabs!  Hahahaha!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No you don't, Plankton!  Ah! Give it here!"
"Plankton"," Oh, no you don't!"
"Plankton"," Yeah, you like that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The recipe—We did it."
"Plankton"," We co-op-er-a-ted."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, let's see what's the flabby that's in this patty."
"Plankton"," One tablespoon listening. Two tablespoons...understanding? Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fold in warm heart. Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. It's a recipe for friendship."
"SpongeBob","  Ta-da! I started the Flabby Patty restaurant just to get you two rascals to team up. And so the power of friendship triumphs again."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? You mean all this was one of your goofball schemes?"
"Plankton"," Now, now, Krabs, SpongeBob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, and how to comically bludgeon meself."
"Plankton"," In fact, I think it's time we repay him, don't you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great idea, pal.  We'll teach you about teamwork.  Get back here! "
"Plankton"," We should do this more often, Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I'm was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall."
"Squidward"," Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that."
"Mr. Krabs"," And why is that, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Because then you'd only get to repair it once."
"SpongeBob"," So, what flavor is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor."
"SpongeBob"," No, I mean the toothpaste!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. Well I think it's... "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium sized hole in the wall!"
"Squidward"," Time to get out the dental floss. Ha. "
"SpongeBob"," Careful now..."
"Mr. Krabs","  We did?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive through!"
"SpongeBob","  A drive--- whoa!"
"Squidward"," Sounds like a lot of extra work to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean for you."
"Squidward","  It'll cost you money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?"
"SpongeBob"," I got this new microphone system which everybody hears them, The sign with a menu on it, and a colorful arrow from the Krusty Krab. It even lights up, see? "
"Mr. Krabs"," OK, but, I got something better. A menu made with napkins and tape, A microphone system made of tin cans, and this sign... I made it from an old noodle."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than I bought?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm sorry, what?"
"SpongeBob"," How is this stuff better?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because it was...  Free!"
"Squidward"," Coming right up, sir. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty, with extra fries and a medium drink."
"SpongeBob"," I'll have that ready for two shakes in a lamprey's tail! hehehehehe!  Oops.  There we go, good as new.  Thank you, come again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, you like it here, don't you?  Can I help you?  What?! A bill?! What's this for?"
"Mr. Krabs","  There we go, problem solved. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Squidward","  Oh, wonderful. Peachy. Now how am I suppose to get two SpongeBobs so I can hand them these order tickets here?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Problem solved!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Hi!"
"Squidward"," Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone back to college."
"Plankton","  Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible By ordering one!  Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra Secret Formula!  Hello!? Is this stupid thing on!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward! Any customers?"
"Squidward"," Not that I can hear."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh? Here comes one now!"
"Plankton"," Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around! "
"Squidward"," With fries. Got it. We'll have it right out to you sir."
"Squidward","  There you are sir. The ketchup is in the b--What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty?"
"Plankton"," "
"Squidward"," Nobody huh? Ok, I'll just toss it in the trash."
"Squidward"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab Drive Thru. Can I take your order?"
"Squidward","  Ow! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurts! A lot!"
"Mr. Krabs"," A bill?! And what is this for?"
"Squidward"," It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You have any idea what a real microphone and speaker costs?!"
"Squidward"," How much?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...they cost as much as...as uh...as a...real microphone and...speaker."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey! You delinquent!"
"Squidward"," Now you have to replace it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Replace what?"
"Squidward"," The microphone!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What do I look like I'm made out of tin cans?"
"Squidward"," No but that pile of tin cans over there is ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good thing we have you around to always point out the obvious!"
"Squidward"," Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well that's nice! I'm still billing you for the damages!"
"SpongeBob","  One Krabby Meal! To go!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing Larry!  Gehh! Gehh!"
"SpongeBob"," Geeehh! ."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs. I'm concerned."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh? Why SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's sub!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah...Well there's a solution to every problem!  There! Problem solved  Hey! What is all the ruckourous about!? Whoa..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!"
"Squidward","  That's nice. That's interesting."
"Mr. Krabs"," I guess I'll be retiring early after all! ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeeesss?  What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah! But officer! I a...I a...Listen!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh sure! Right! Phew! Hah hah hah...SpongeBob can you get the kind officer two-"
"SpongeBob","  -Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Mayor!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...don't you worry Mr. Mayor! I have a answer for that too!  There you go! See now we have two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! ."
"SpongeBob"," Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra cheese...."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Order up!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it! ."
"Squidward"," Hurry SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!"
"SpongeBob","  26 orders up!"
"Squidward","  No no no! Not that window! The other one!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, are you sure!? These customers over here look really really hungry! ."
"Squidward","  And these ones don't!"
"Plankton","  Chum Nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're running! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off, for me!  Oh no...not again. ."
"Plankton","  Watch where you going old man! This is the second time!"
"Plankton"," Chum Nuggets...get them before  my arm falls off..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Gasp! They're everywhere!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay back! Take Squidward, not me!  Oh, hi Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! We got to do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!"
"Squidward"," For once, he's right!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Easy boys! Easy! Don't you think you both are getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right, hah hah. Like-  Oh....kay...Don't worry! I can solve this!  More drive thrus! More money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey? Somebody eating potato chips?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Mr. Krabs!  We can fix it!  We might want to buy some more toothpaste though."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob","  ♪Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!♪  For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you sir."
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all! "
"SpongeBob"," It wasn't?"
"SpongeBob"," Then, who was it for?"
"SpongeBob"," Gasp! It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver!  And his first born son Tony Fast Jr!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," What does ""Incorrigible"" mean?"
"SpongeBob"," IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU TONY FAST JR! "
"SpongeBob","  Ok! Uh roll!? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that!?  I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I-"
"SpongeBob"," JUST DRIVING!  W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean!?"
"SpongeBob"," Relax... RELAX!? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard!  RAW! I CAN'T RELAX!"
"SpongeBob"," LET GO?!?"
"SpongeBob"," Be cool?"
"SpongeBob"," Be... cooool...  Cooool..."
"SpongeBob"," I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeeahh!"
"SpongeBob"," None taken!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I'll be delighted to!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," It's SpongeBob SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," SpoonggeeeBoooobb, Squuuaarrreee Paaannnttts!  Tony Fast Jr!"
"SpongeBob","  Nice place you got here Tony Jr!"
"SpongeBob"," Oohh! Uh, what does that mean?"
"SpongeBob"," OH WOULD I!?!?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! They're so shiny!"
"SpongeBob"," My favorite!? Oh I couldn't!"
"SpongeBob","  This one!"
"SpongeBob"," A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow Tony Jr! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous..."
"SpongeBob"," Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... MY NERVES!  Sorry sir!"
"SpongeBob"," Let go... got it!  Whee!"
"SpongeBob"," Faster?"
"SpongeBob"," Eh... if you say so!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!"
"SpongeBob"," Whee... RED LIGHT! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks TFJ..."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! Ah ha ha ha!"
"SpongeBob"," Right here, right now? A little short notice...  let me check my availability.  Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!"
"SpongeBob"," However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't hear anything..."
"SpongeBob"," I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!"
"SpongeBob"," Grrr... GRRR! "
"SpongeBob","  Grrr!"
"SpongeBob"," We're winning! We're winning!"
"SpongeBob","  Huh? Oh no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do!?"
"SpongeBob"," Now there's a helicopter after us!"
"SpongeBob"," What're we going to do!? "
"SpongeBob"," Now your dad is after us!"
"SpongeBob"," How should I know!? He's YOUR dad!"
"SpongeBob","  Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far?! Huh, Tony Jr?! "
"SpongeBob","   "
"SpongeBob","  Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!"
"Patrick","  Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged. "
"Patrick"," Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts?  Hey, rain! You better stop that! "
"Patrick","  Aah!"
"Squidward","  If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how..."
"Squidward"," Don't care. "
"SpongeBob","  I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain!  Hey,   that gives me an idea. "
"Squidward","  Hey! Hello? Nitwit, morons."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!"
"Squidward"," I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!"
"Patrick"," But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five. "
"Squidward"," I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna..."
"Patrick"," Join us on the back nine?"
"Squidward"," Just don't let it happen again! Or else. "
"SpongeBob"," Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man."
"Squidward"," Would you two keep it down!"
"SpongeBob"," Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't wanna upset Squidward."
"Patrick"," Can't wait to lose, huh?  No! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and- "
"Patrick"," Nice shot. "
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing?"
"Patrick"," Moving my ball."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you have to play it where it lands."
"Patrick"," Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?"
"Patrick"," Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance."
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick, this is just a game."
"Patrick"," Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win."
"SpongeBob"," I think you're missing the point. "
"Patrick"," Speaking of m-m-missing!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  Yes! See if you can top that!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey.  A pressure-packed shot to be sure. "
"Patrick"," Looks like we're tied, three shots to three."
"SpongeBob"," Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots."
"Patrick"," Whatever.  And he sinks another hole in one! That's two in a row!"
"SpongeBob"," All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now."
"Patrick"," Watch out for the water hazard."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot."
"Patrick"," I have no idea what you're talking about."
"SpongeBob"," Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you.  Oops."
"Patrick"," Show-off. I can do that. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, where did our balls go?"
"Patrick"," Well, how do I know? I was just copying you."
"SpongeBob","  Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point."
"Patrick"," Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet."
"SpongeBob"," But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!"
"Patrick"," Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?"
"Patrick"," Okay, okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Now where is that darn ball?"
"Patrick"," Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, have you seen by ball?"
"Patrick"," Was it a red one?"
"SpongeBob"," M-hmm."
"Patrick"," It might have been in the kelp salad."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you ate my ball?"
"Patrick"," Don't worry, I'll get it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no!"
"Patrick"," No?"
"SpongeBob"," I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere. "
"SpongeBob"," There it is!"
"Patrick"," Uh-oh."
"SpongeBob"," Play it where it lies."
"Patrick","  Hole in one! Top that!"
"SpongeBob"," I could do that blindfolded. "
"Patrick"," Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!"
"SpongeBob","  Aha!"
"Patrick"," Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick... "
"Patrick"," Stop peeking! Hotter.  Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! This is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick!"
"Patrick","  Aah!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing?"
"Patrick"," I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you please get back in the game?"
"Patrick"," But I wanted to try this loofah."
"SpongeBob"," Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Uhh, look a little closer, buddy."
"SpongeBob","  Play it where it lies?"
"Patrick"," Play it where it lies."
"SpongeBob"," But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?"
"Patrick"," All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, you're good to go."
"Patrick"," Fore!  It's all yours."
"SpongeBob"," This one's for all the marbles."
"Patrick"," But I thought we weren't betting."
"SpongeBob"," No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. "
"Squidward","  What's going on here? "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning."
"Patrick"," Sorry we woke you."
"Squidward","  Wha-What? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?"
"Patrick"," Good game, pal."
"SpongeBob"," Rematch next Saturday?"
"Patrick"," Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for your help, Gar!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?"
"Patrick"," It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!"
"Patrick"," Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!  See ya again next spring.  Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Patrick"," Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value.  You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories.  No!  Come on, you!  Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories.  Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?"
"SpongeBob","  Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special."
"Squidward"," Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment."
"SpongeBob"," You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, perfect!  Ah, memories. Greasy memories."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!"
"Squidward"," You're sentimental about your sweat?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!"
"Squidward"," OK, this is getting creepy now."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well, better get these precious memories home."
"Squidward"," Officially creeped out now."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪  Hey, Gary.  Oh. Safe and sound!  Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything."
"SpongeBob"," Like the front yard!"
"SpongeBob"," Who is it? "
"Squidward"," It's Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," How do I know it's you?"
"Squidward"," Open the door, nitwit!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?"
"Squidward"," You can certainly help...  Why are you wearing garbage?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning."
"Squidward"," Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy,  Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?!  You will be missed."
"Squidward"," Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call. "
"Squidward"," Thank goodness you're here, officer."
"Squidward"," No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi!"
"SpongeBob"," Condemned? What does that mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Vacate? You mean I have to move?"
"Squidward"," Thank you again, officers."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Please don't condemn my house."
"Squidward"," Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow."
"Squidward"," Really?"
"Squidward"," My house?!"
"SpongeBob"," But isn't there anything we can do?"
"SpongeBob"," Throw them away?"
"Squidward"," Ma'am? It's a nightshirt!  This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!"
"SpongeBob"," I know.  I'm gonna miss them so much! "
"Squidward"," You really miss them?"
"SpongeBob"," No. I'll be strong. "
"Squidward"," Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away."
"SpongeBob"," That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!"
"Squidward"," Creepy."
"Squidward","  Oh, good grief. "
"SpongeBob"," Your pay, my good man. "
"SpongeBob","  Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump! "
"Squidward"," Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed. "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, nighty-night. "
"Squidward"," Idiot.  What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house. "
"Patrick"," Nice dress. "
"Squidward","  It's a nightshirt!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary and I are gonna  try to win the prize so Mr. Krabs can fix up the Krusty Krab.  Right, Gary?"
"Patrick"," I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want!  Good thing I brought out the heavy artillery  Gooey Worms!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, those don't move."
"Patrick"," Sure they do! Giddy up!  Hyah!  See?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Where fetchin' money's involved, nobody topples me."
"Squidward"," Hello, out there, Bikini Bottom!  I'm glad I can finally talk to my fans on television!"
"Plankton"," So long, suckers."
"Patrick"," Come on, wormies! Giddy up!  Hmm."
"Plankton"," Alone at last!  Now, there's nothing between me and the secret formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," C'mon, boys! Get me to the greenbacks!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No!  I can't let him win."
"Sandy","  Don't worry, he won't.  I will.  Yeehaw!"
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick. Where's your sleigh?"
"Patrick"," I dunno."
"SpongeBob"," Hop in. We'll give you a lift.  Come on, Gary!"
"Plankton"," Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.Good thing I brought this along.I'm gonna need something with more firepower."
"Sandy"," Woo wee! Looks like I lost them!  The remote shorted out! The robots are stuck in high gear! Whoa!  Aaaa!"
"Squidward"," Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!"
"Squidward"," I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts!"
"Patrick"," Whoa! Look at that!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Free!  He doesn't look so ""hot."" We better take him with us."
"Patrick"," Good idea."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you hear that?"
"Sandy","  Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys."
"SpongeBob"," No problem, right, Gar?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Heeelp!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms! "
"SpongeBob"," Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Much appreciate it, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," This is a dead end! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great. Now we're trapped."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh..."
"Patrick","  It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! How about a campfire song? "
"Squidward"," No! Singing!"
"Squidward","  Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?"
"Squidward","  Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not you again!"
"Sandy"," Ha! Slimeless snow vermin! You missed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's weren't the attack."
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This is it! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! "
"Squidward","  Oh... not again... "
"Mr. Krabs","  "
"SpongeBob"," What is that formidable creature?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk."
"SpongeBob"," I thought that was just a myth."
"SpongeBob"," Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled at those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, that didn't work.  She swallowed us up in one swift swallow. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my! Well at least you bravely escaped out the tail."
"Mr. Krabs"," Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. "
"SpongeBob"," Hm? Oh! Ew."
"Sandy"," I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!"
"Patrick"," Oh, be careful, this is my last one! "
"SpongeBob"," Hold on tight! "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here! "
"Sandy"," Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh?  Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to win us out so he can get the prize himself! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Argargarg! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish the winning with y-- "
"Sandy"," We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!"
"Patrick"," Hey! "
"Sandy","  What's the big emergency, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I saw something shiny."
"Sandy","  Oh! Well, let's drop everything, then!"
"SpongeBob"," No wait Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen."
"SpongeBob","  Karen?"
"Sandy"," I say she's in quick need of a reboot! Heee ya! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh?  Plankton?  Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him."
"Patrick","  We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile. "
"Sandy"," A citylacra!"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, please! Language!"
"Sandy"," Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!"
"SpongeBob"," Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!"
"Sandy"," And exactly how do you propose we find him?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Marsh! Marsh!"
"Plankton","  Hehehehe!  Yooooouch!  So the safe isn't vulnerable of flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive!  Ahem! I meant destructive! "
"SpongeBob"," A little more, Gary!"
"Sandy"," Look out! "
"Sandy"," Hold on, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  We made it! Right, Squidward? "
"Sandy"," Gasp! Oh my gosh! Patrick! Wing to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am"
"Sandy"," Gotcha!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy, have you given any thought to we're gonna--...land. "
"Plankton","  Fire in the hole!  Rats."
"Sandy"," Look, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! "
"Patrick","  I can't feel my looking holes!"
"SpongeBob"," The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. "
"Sandy"," You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through my bag of nuts.  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of that Gooey Worms on you?"
"Patrick"," I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary! "
"SpongeBob"," Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard too hard on you, eh? Sorry, I won't make you tow another inch. "
"Patrick"," Great, now we're stuck."
"SpongeBob"," No, we're not! We'll-- Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body."
"Sandy"," We must be heading in the right direction!"
"Plankton","   Secret formula, you are mine! "
"Plankton"," Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will steal your content, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit.  Molecule by molecule.  Atom by atom!  Uh-oh."
"Plankton"," Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! "
"Patrick","  Hey, trying to sleep."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs!"
"Sandy"," He doesn't look so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? SpongeBob! He froze up too. "
"Squidward"," Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh? Are you aware that's our mode of transportation?"
"Sandy"," And are you aware I just saved your life?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Duped? You don't mean by..."
"Mr. Krabs"," My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!"
"Squidward","  We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh."
"Mr. Krabs"," We're doomed. Oh hoho! "
"SpongeBob","  No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace."
"Sandy"," Just leave that to the scientist of the group!"
"Patrick","  Oh geez... why do I have to do everything?"
"Sandy"," "
"Patrick"," Hahahaha!"
"Sandy"," She's all fired up!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Lookin' clear so far."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray! We made it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay... then where's my restaurant?"
"SpongeBob"," Perhaps over there.. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And where's my formula? "
"Sandy","  Perhaps over there."
"Mr. Krabs"," The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! "
"SpongeBob"," We're too late!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We'll see about that boy-o!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This will only take a minute. "
"Plankton","  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!"
"Plankton"," Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I guess I didn't want to miss the grand unveiling of my sandwich."
"Plankton","  Well it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!"
"Patrick"," Oh, that's easy! "
"Plankton"," Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. "
"Sandy","  That may be true Plankton but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides."
"Plankton","  Uh... well I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!"
"Plankton"," Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! "
"Plankton"," Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then hand over my formula."
"Plankton"," Okay Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oops, here I go. Hahahaha! Looks like I've out smarted you again aye fools? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You get back here, Plankton!"
"SpongeBob","  Here we go again..."
"Plankton"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!"
"Plankton"," I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh, you're so close.  So long suckers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"Plankton"," Hehehe!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We're trapped!"
"Plankton"," That's right Krabs and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you."
"Mr. Krabs"," He's going to turn us into fried snacks!"
"Plankton"," Got any dipping sauce? A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?"
"SpongeBob"," Nom nom?"
"SpongeBob"," W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me packed with nutrients!"
"Sandy"," No, eat me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't eat me, eat Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Wait what?!"
"SpongeBob"," She loves your jellybeans Patrick!"
"Plankton"," I better go while the going's good."
"Plankton"," I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?"
"Mr. Krabs"," He'll have to wait for nature to take its' course. "
"Plankton","  Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," You ready for some fun old pal?"
"Patrick"," I sure am old buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, here comes fun now! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Doesn't get any better than that!"
"Patrick"," Yeah! I love boat screaming! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Here comes another one!"
"SpongeBob"," Here comes another one! "
"Patrick"," AHHHHHHHHHH! "
"Plankton"," Morons!"
"Squidward","  Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, good morning Squidward! Yeah, Patrick here told me."
"Squidward"," When are you two gonna grow up?"
"Patrick"," How do you play that?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh!? Maybe Squidward can come down and teach us how to play it! That will be real fun won't it Patrick?  AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh...  It just not the same without Patrick playing along too.  Alright Patrick, you leave me no choice. "
"Patrick"," Ow!  What's the big idea!?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! You have a beard!"
"Patrick"," I do? "
"SpongeBob"," You sure look grown-up with that new beard!"
"Patrick"," Wow! You really think so? "
"Squidward"," And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose."
"Patrick"," I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?"
"Squidward"," Show you?"
"Patrick"," Show me! Show me! Oh please, please, please! Pretty please! Pretty please!"
"Squidward","  I know I'm going to regret this... Alright! I will take on this mission!"
"Patrick"," Hooray!"
"Squidward"," In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," May I tag along and observe your instruction?"
"Squidward"," Why in a million years will I let you tag along?"
"SpongeBob"," Because some of your instructions in maturity will rub off on me! Bringing us TWO steps closer to a quiet, grown-up neighborhood!"
"Squidward"," Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!"
"SpongeBob"," Is that a yes?"
"Squidward","  Okay."
"Squidward"," Let me escort you to my place my good sir! We need to start with personal grooming for your grown-up makeover!"
"Patrick","  Sounds good to me!"
"Squidward"," We may have to find you clothes as well."
"Patrick"," New clothes?"
"Squidward"," To go along with your new beard which makes you look very distinguished!"
"Patrick"," Distinguished?"
"SpongeBob","  Alright! Distinguished!"
"Patrick","  Yeah!"
"Squidward","  Excuse me! Grown-ups do not high-five!"
"Patrick"," Oh, right!"
"SpongeBob","  We do do da do do de! "
"SpongeBob"," So um, what do you guys think? Sweet duds huh Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Heh heh, sure are!"
"Squidward"," Ahem!"
"Patrick"," For a baby!"
"Squidward"," Well played Patrick! Well played... "
"Patrick"," Why certainly. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Eats!  Yum! Yum! Yum!"
"Patrick"," Oh! Are those chocolate chip cookies? Can I have-"
"Squidward"," Patrick! I'm sure you'd rather have some tetrazzini we grown-ups ordered, right?"
"Patrick"," Duh, yeah Squidward. I'm frankly shocked they serve such elementary fare here."
"Squidward"," Indeed..."
"Squidward"," And my personal favorite piece is  this lovely statue from the Reef-aissance Era-"
"Patrick"," Boring!"
"Squidward"," Boring!?"
"Patrick"," Oh, ah no. I said flooring! The flooring compliments the artwork here exquisitely!"
"Squidward"," Yeah... yes I suppose it does...  SpongeBob! You get down from there right now!"
"SpongeBob","  DOH!  Don't worry you guys! I'm okay! Really! I'm okay!  There! Good as ne- ah! All fixed you guys! "
"Patrick"," Security! "
"SpongeBob"," Please be gentle!  Heh, that's weird I thought I was gonna get tossed out on my...  AHHHHHHHHH! "
"Squidward"," Patrick Star, I am very proud of you for what you did in there! You know that beard is the best thing that has ever happened to you! Well, other than me of course. Heh..."
"SpongeBob"," Beard... I must remove that beard!  Remove beard! Restore friendship! "
"Squidward"," And that's what I told them look I wanted to... "
"SpongeBob"," That's it! It must be done!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! The only thing that must be done is cutting the cord with you!"
"SpongeBob"," No please!"
"Squidward"," Look Mr. BabyPants  it's gladly clear you learned nothing today on how to be mature!"
"SpongeBob"," But-"
"Squidward"," No buts! We are through entertaining your company! Shall we?"
"Patrick"," Let's shall! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, don't leave me! "
"Patrick","  Why are they so many stairs!?"
"Squidward"," You only gone up three stairs! "
"Patrick"," It feels like four."
"Squidward"," We are about to enter the pinnacle of grown-up culture here in Bikini Bottom! Also known as The Famed Bikini Bottom Opera House! "
"Patrick"," What?"
"Squidward"," Nothing, let's find our seats. "
"Patrick"," Hey, alright! Box seats! Uh, I mean This seat choice is most mature! Certainly more so than that rapscallion Sponge whose name we shall not mention will picked!"
"Squidward"," Certainly"
"Patrick"," A most exemplary performance!"
"Squidward"," Oh! Oh! It gets even more thrilling from here!"
"Squidward"," What the?!"
"Patrick"," She's beautiful!"
"SpongeBob","  There's once, was a man, from Nantucket.  Sorry, wrong one! AHEM! ♪Dear friend, don't say that over! As long as I breathe, I will cherish our bond!♪"
"Squidward"," Terrible!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Dear friend, don't say that it is all over! My heart bounces on rocks, jagged and gray! Dear friend, don't that it is all over! Let's stay pals! What do! You say?♪"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Exit stage left is that away!"
"Patrick"," Hey! Stop that beard!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! It's not a beard! It's a sea urchin! It must've been sleeping on your face until your tears woke it from its hibernation."
"Patrick"," How do you know my name!?"
"SpongeBob"," Because Mr. Patrick Star...  You told me."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Oh, please! You can call me Patrick!"
"Squidward"," Quiet! Hold it! Stop it right there! I am ashamed and disgusted by you people! I mean don't you know what terrible performance when you see it!?"
"Squidward"," That's what I thought you- No! No! No! I didn't mean it like that! It was-"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? . SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low.  Why are you grilling index cards? "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted.  I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow."
"Squidward"," You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay! Okay!  Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday."
"SpongeBob"," No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes!  Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!"
"Squidward","  Must I do everything myself?  Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn. "
"SpongeBob"," I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything. "
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry, wrong rock. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes."
"Patrick"," Okay.  Uhhh..."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here.  Just pretend you're a student at his desk."
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, here goes.  Boating safety is..."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice."
"Patrick"," Fine."
"SpongeBob","  Boating safe..."
"Patrick"," Boring! Next!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?"
"Patrick"," All right, all right. "
"SpongeBob"," So, without further ado...  Patrick?  Patrick, wake up.  What happened, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?"
"Patrick"," Yes! And you should be prepared for worse."
"SpongeBob"," Worse?"
"Patrick"," You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again."
"SpongeBob"," Okay.  Boating safety...  Boating safe... "
"Patrick"," That's it!  Fight through! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!"
"Patrick"," Says you! Speech!"
"SpongeBob"," Boating safe..."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, you sorta add a hand in that too Patrick."
"Patrick","  Young man, how dare you! "
"SpongeBob"," Wha, a detention slip?"
"Patrick","  I'm not hearing your oral report."
"SpongeBob"," Okay.  Boating safe... "
"Patrick"," Try again."
"SpongeBob","  Boating safety... "
"Patrick"," Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. "
"Patrick","  Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Spee -"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything. "
"Patrick"," Yeah, you do look pretty terrible."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if I don't do my report then I don't pass. And if I don't pass then I don't get my boating license! "
"Patrick"," Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya. "
"Sandy"," Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted to severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy"," It has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear."
"Sandy"," Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these.  Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license."
"SpongeBob"," That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working."
"Sandy"," Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  Eh! Ooh, they work."
"Patrick","  Go on, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Huh...?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready!  I can do it.  Um...  Oh, no. Oh, no!"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay.  Uh, my report...is on...  Heh! Must be last-minute genders!  Patrick, where are those goggles?"
"Patrick"," Right here. Let me polish them up for ya.  Here ya go."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks! "
"SpongeBob","  ""Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because -- "
"SpongeBob","  They're all staring! "
"Patrick"," Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait!  SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," Wait, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know how!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do.  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--"
"SpongeBob"," --""for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care""."
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!"
"Patrick"," Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh! "
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?"
"SpongeBob"," Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening."
"Squidward"," You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock.  He had a lump on his head—"
"Squidward","  I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this.  Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money."
"Squidward"," Fish flute?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the—"
"Squidward"," None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—"
"Squidward"," None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not even—even—oh, there's nobody there."
"Plankton"," He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?"
"Plankton"," The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!"
"Plankton"," No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too."
"Plankton"," Too late! "
"Squidward"," Who said that?"
"Plankton"," Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have."
"Squidward"," Oh, really?"
"Plankton"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here."
"Plankton"," You do?"
"Squidward"," You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is."
"Plankton"," Well, that's not exactly why I—"
"Squidward"," Shameless. You again?"
"Plankton"," I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day."
"Squidward","  Why, yes, it is, isn't it?"
"Plankton"," Yes, it—not buying that one either, huh?"
"Squidward"," Nope. "
"Plankton"," Hey, buddy!  Squidward!  Free cleaning service?  Census taker.  Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies?  Ow! "
"Plankton"," There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish.  Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula? "
"Plankton"," Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Plankton. Nice dress."
"Plankton"," Out of my way, SpongeBrain."
"SpongeBob"," I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round.  Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master."
"Plankton"," None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever."
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music."
"Plankton"," Music?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own."
"Plankton"," Oh, is that right?"
"Squidward","  Not again."
"Plankton"," Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one."
"Squidward"," Are you sure you got the right squid?"
"Plankton"," I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic. "
"Squidward"," Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on."
"Plankton"," Uh-oh. I mean, goodie."
"Squidward"," "
"Plankton"," Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!"
"Squidward"," Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?"
"Plankton"," It's delightful!  Bravo!  Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!"
"Squidward","  My very own fan. "
"Plankton"," Bravo!"
"Plankton"," Encore, encore, encore!"
"Squidward"," I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance."
"Plankton"," Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to..."
"Squidward"," Want to... sing?"
"Plankton"," That's the word I was looking for!"
"Squidward"," A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four. "
"Plankton"," ♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ ♪To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ ♪No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...♪"
"Squidward"," It's all in the wrist. "
"Plankton"," Hooray!"
"Squidward"," Thank you, thank you."
"Plankton"," Say, uh, musical genius?"
"Squidward"," Yes?"
"Plankton"," When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?"
"Squidward"," It is an unfortunate truth."
"Plankton"," And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?"
"Squidward"," That's an understatement."
"Plankton"," Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register. "
"Plankton"," But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something."
"Squidward"," Nope. Haven't seen a thing. "
"Plankton"," You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!"
"Squidward"," Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician."
"Plankton"," What?"
"Squidward"," It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed. "
"Sandy"," Mayday! Mayday!"
"Squidward"," In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician."
"Plankton"," But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula.  Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No!  Come back, I need you!  Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!"
"Squidward"," Hey!  Come back!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing ""doorslam"" and I was wondering if I could—"
"Squidward"," Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! I wanna play!"
"Plankton","  Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is. "
"SpongeBob"," Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!"
"Plankton"," You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!"
"Plankton"," You do? Oh."
"Plankton"," Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life."
"SpongeBob"," He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar— "
"Mr. Krabs"," There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course."
"Plankton"," No, wait! Please! Karen, help!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet. "
"Squidward"," Once again, I hate people."
"Squidward"," La da de, la da dum, la da doo. La da dee. Ah, it's a great day for the art world.  Famous art critic Fredrick T. Nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. I love hearing myself talk."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi Squid...  Whoa!  I love your hat."
"Squidward","  Don't touch it! And it's not a hat. It's a beret."
"SpongeBob"," A beret? Oh, where can I get one?"
"Squidward"," Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi."
"Patrick"," You're an artist?"
"Squidward"," Yes, I'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  I made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  And I also made this cute little scallop house."
"SpongeBob"," And I made this wallet,  and I crocheted money to go in it. "
"Squidward"," So, you've been counterfeiting currency? And what's doorknob number two been up to?"
"Patrick","  I've been making baskets too.  Darn! This hammer is defective."
"SpongeBob"," Do you want to make crafts too?"
"Squidward"," Crafts?  This isn't summer camp. I am a true artiste. "
"Patrick"," Oh man. I'll never make art like you and...Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, don't be sad. You can be an artist too. I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set.  Now let me see. Oh, this'll be perfect! Now, start with a rock... "
"Patrick"," Uh."
"SpongeBob"," A little glue... "
"Patrick"," Uh."
"SpongeBob"," Stick on a couple of googly eyes... "
"Patrick"," Whoa. Slow down, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," And presto A rock with googly eyes!"
"Patrick"," Whoa. I did not see that coming!"
"SpongeBob"," Now you try! "
"Patrick"," I'm scared."
"SpongeBob"," You can do this!"
"Patrick"," I shall make the attempt!  Privacy, please?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry. "
"Patrick"," I've done it!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, let's take a look!"
"Patrick","  Behold!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Oh! Oh, it's beautiful!"
"Patrick"," I'm an artist!"
"Squidward"," Hate."
"Squidward"," Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  Witness ""La Vista Squidward""! Stunning, isn't it?"
"Squidward"," What? No! No, you can't do that!"
"Patrick"," I'm an artist! Hooray!"
"Squidward"," No, wait, come back!"
"SpongeBob"," We both are. It's lots of fun! Would you like to make something, too?"
"Patrick"," Don't judge me! "
"Patrick"," Is that good?"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"Squidward"," You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Did you hear that, Squidward? Patrick is an artist!"
"Squidward"," Oh, , selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!"
"SpongeBob"," How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Well, about...Um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"Patrick"," Um...ok!  Art! "
"Squidward"," I'll bet he never sells another!"
"Squidward"," I'll bet"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, I think we should have a little talk about your gambling problem. "
"Squidward"," I actually want to go to work today! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh! I'm almost late to be early for work! See ya later, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," So long, my trusted, yet untalented friend!  One for you! And one for you! And one for...  I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!"
"Patrick"," Um, the artist needs a long time! "
"Patrick"," I'm all out of rocks! What am I going to do now? That was my thing! Oh!  Tartar sauce!  That stinks, too!  The artist needs a lunch break!"
"Squidward"," Oh, not you again! May I take your order?"
"Patrick","  Uuuuuummmmm! Uhhhhhhhhh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty."
"Squidward"," One Krabby Patty "
"Patrick"," But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable! "
"Squidward","  Then, what do you want?"
"Patrick"," I don't know! I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!"
"SpongeBob"," Hiya, Patrick! Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?"
"Patrick"," Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, that's terrible.."
"Squidward"," Just order already!"
"Patrick"," Ok, I want new ideas to spice up hunger for my goodly goods!"
"Squidward"," Off the menu? Choose something off the menu! We don't serve artistic advice here!"
"Patrick"," Well then, why is it on the menu?"
"Squidward"," Huh? What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get back to work, Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," In case you haven't noticed,  this is not an artist hat! "
"Patrick"," Oh, you can borrow mine! "
"Squidward"," Beautiful. "
"SpongeBob"," Make yourself comfortable, Mister Patrick! Our artistic consultant will be right with you!"
"SpongeBob"," This is Mr. Tentacles. He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!"
"Squidward"," Mm-hmm!"
"Patrick"," Mm-hmm. Pleasure!"
"SpongeBob"," Here's your Krabby Patty!  Shall I put it on your tab?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. Keep it open. We may be here all night! Let me say up front, I'm a fan! I'm excited to learn from a genius like you. My artistic needs and knowledge are in your hands! I hope someone's writing all this. Ok........... advise!"
"Squidward","  Why don't you just concentrate on your patty? "
"Patrick","  Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do! "
"SpongeBob"," You did it, Patrick! You found your inspiration!"
"Patrick","  And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!"
"SpongeBob"," You got it, buddy! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Ooh, money! Money, money, money, money, money, money, money!  What the?  SpongeBob!  Patrick!  What's the meaning of this?"
"Patrick"," It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50. "
"Squidward"," Ha and ha!"
"Patrick"," Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! It was your idea, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!"
"Patrick"," I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man."
"Patrick"," If you work real hard, you might be an artist too someday!"
"Patrick"," Mm, probably not. Needs more glitter."
"Mr. Krabs","  Please be money, please be money.  Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob.  ""Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party."" Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!"
"Squidward","  ""Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight I am having a...  ...latte sipping contest?"" This sound too good to be true!"
"Sandy","  ""Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!"" Oh SpongeBob this sounds too good to be true!"" "
"Plankton","  ""A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?"" This sounds too good to be true!"
"SpongeBob","  Welcome friends! Please come in!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh... SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?"
"Squidward"," How 'bout the latte sipping?"
"Plankton"," And diabolical conspiracies?"
"Sandy"," And let's not forget the science fair!"
"SpongeBob"," The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation!"
"Patrick"," Ahaha! Ahaha! Sorry I'm late, SpongeBob! I had to find my movie watching hat!"
"Plankton"," That does it... I'm gone.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! "
"Squidward"," Looks more like a slip than a slide. Ha ha!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've seen enough."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Come back!  See, it's Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hey! It's me!"
"Squidward"," Why is it all orange and blurry?"
"SpongeBob"," Where?"
"Squidward"," See, right there on the entire thing!"
"SpongeBob","Oh! That's because Patrick was spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry."
"Patrick"," I can't help it, SpongeBob! I'm so excited about going on a family vacation with you and your parents that my aim is off!  See?  There we go..."
"SpongeBob"," I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!"
"Patrick"," Really? Why is that?"
"SpongeBob"," Probably because I have."
"Patrick"," Have what?"
"SpongeBob"," Been waiting."
"Patrick","  Wait... you mean so... What?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! They're here!"
"SpongeBob"," You bet!"
"SpongeBob","  That's not a luggage, that's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember?"
"Patrick","  You brought homework?"
"SpongeBob"," No Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination!  The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines..."
"Patrick","  And forts..."
"SpongeBob"," And ropes to swing on..."
"Patrick","  And forts."
"SpongeBob"," And a water park!  Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it.  I can't wait to get there! How about you?"
"Patrick"," No, I can't."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah..."
"Patrick","  No, I mean I really can't.  I've been in this confined space for too long, somebody help!  Get me out of here! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Patrick","  Oh! Oh! Oh! Hide and seek! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, why does he get to go first?"
"Patrick","  Okay find me!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should just sing the road song."
"Patrick","  Road. Road. Road. Road. "
"SpongeBob"," When I'm on the road..."
"Patrick"," Road. Road."
"SpongeBob"," I see stuff going by. When I'm on the road..."
"Patrick"," Road. Road."
"SpongeBob"," I got a bug in my eye! When I'm on the road..."
"SpongeBob"," Looks like clear skies ahead!"
"SpongeBob"," When I'm on the road..."
"Patrick"," Road! Road! Road!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's all sing the road sooooong...  I want to sing it all day long! Let's all sing the road song  Let's all siiiing along."
"Patrick"," Road road road road road road rooooad."
"SpongeBob"," Um... Anyone else know any good road tunes?"
"SpongeBob"," How much farther to the nearest service station?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I guess you're right!"
"Patrick","  How much time?  Not funny."
"SpongeBob","  Hey at least they have a cozy-looking waiting room!  Come on!"
"SpongeBob"," Man, am I bored."
"Patrick"," I am beyond bored. I'm... beyord."
"Patrick"," Not the most colorful playground I've seen."
"SpongeBob","  Mm Mm. This looks more like a gray-ground. "
"SpongeBob","  Actually this place seems a little bit-"
"Patrick"," Well this is a nasty turn of events."
"SpongeBob"," You're preaching to the choir, Patrick."
"Patrick","  I knew it was gonna happen, too."
"SpongeBob"," You did? How?"
"Patrick","  Because it happens every time I keep my cheese fizz in my back pocket!  Darn! It's almost empty!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it.  This is fun! Hey Patrick, you gotta try thi-"
"Patrick","  Huh?  SpongeBob were you talking to me?  I could have sworn SpongeBob was calling me from... this direction... SpongeBob where are you?! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick."
"Patrick"," Huh? SpongeBob? Oh come on, where are you hiding? This isn't funny!  Huh "
"SpongeBob","  Uh, Patrick I'm right here."
"Patrick","  Oh, hey SpongeBob! How'd ya get there?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I was on this see-saw-"
"Patrick","  SLIDE! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you need help?"
"Patrick","  Huh? With this slide stuck to my bottom? Nah, I want it there.  I HATE YOU SLIDE!  Oh, sorry SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob","  Hey look, a swing set!  Can't go wrong with this old-time playground favorite.  Weee... Hey, this is almost like being at the Great Barrier Reef, huh? Try it, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Okay.  It's not working."
"SpongeBob","  Go back and forth like this.  There you go! Now you're getting into the... SWING of things! "
"Patrick","  Hey, watch me go! OH! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! I'm coming!  ...Patrick?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Are you okay?"
"Patrick"," No, I'm not okay."
"SpongeBob"," You're not?"
"Patrick"," No. I'm great! That was awesome! Let's do it again! "
"SpongeBob"," Something tells me that is a one-way drain."
"SpongeBob","  How long have we been walking here, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Well, that depends on who you ask."
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Patrick"," Well, if you ask someone with a watch, they might be able to tell you. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you getting hun-gry?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! How'd you know?"
"SpongeBob"," I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us. "
"Patrick"," That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though..."
"SpongeBob"," It couldn't?"
"Patrick","  Nope! I had its vocal cords removed before the trip."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I could've sworn that I heard- "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I heard it! I heard growling!"
"SpongeBob"," No, that time it was my stomach. There's got to be something around here to eat.  Patrick, I found some berries we can-  not eat!"
"Patrick","  Thanks for the warning."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, where did you get  the Kelp Kake?"
"Patrick"," From the vending machine! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh..."
"Patrick"," Was it your stomach that time too?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope... RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"
"SpongeBob"," It's getting closer!  Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do?"
"Patrick"," Don't ask me! I don't remember ""being eaten alive"" on this trip's itinerary! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm too young to be digested! "
"Patrick"," Wait SpongeBob! I know how to get us out of this!"
"SpongeBob"," You do?"
"Patrick"," I saw something like this in a movie once! Now watch closely, and do exactly what I do!"
"SpongeBob"," Rodger!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, now what?"
"Patrick"," I'm not sure, I fell asleep in the second half of the movie!"
"Patrick"," Well I hope that monsters carrying some syrup!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah because if he eats us he's having pancakes for lunch!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we did it!"
"Patrick"," We're not gonna be eaten!"
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," All this not being eaten is making me hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry. Once we get to the Great Barrier Reef, we'll eat like kings!"
"SpongeBob"," Now put 'em there, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Put 'em there!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh Patrick, have you been using a different moisturizer? Because your hands feel kind of- "
"Patrick"," Oh no, it's just the same old moisturizer I always use. "
"Patrick"," Oh come on Spongebob, don't leave me hanging here! ...Let me guess, it's time to start screaming again?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second.  Okay now."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, as much as I'd like to stay and hang around, I'm not sure now's the time..."
"SpongeBob"," I know Patrick, but now it seems to be-  Our best possible course of action!"
"Patrick"," Giddy-up! Hyah!"
"SpongeBob"," Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, those are hash browns."
"Patrick"," Hash browns! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, Patrick, the slides."
"Patrick"," Right. The slides.  Voila! Uh, now what?"
"SpongeBob"," Now you put the slides in the projector."
"Patrick","  I knew that. Put the slides in the projec--  ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better.  Okay, here we go.  There I was..."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh, a shadow puppet show!"
"Patrick"," Please, no interruptions."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry."
"Patrick"," As I was saying...  I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door.  For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?"
"Patrick","  I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest. I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.  It's so exhausting.  Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me."
"SpongeBob"," Pal, what you need is a vacation."
"Patrick"," That's it! I need a vacation. "
"Patrick","  Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, he'd like a vacation."
"Patrick"," I guess I'll just have to stay home."
"SpongeBob"," ""Stay home""? That's it. You can take a ""stay-cation."""
"Patrick"," Wh-what's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free."
"Patrick"," Oh boy! "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation."
"Patrick"," That's what I'm gonna do, buddy. "
"SpongeBob","  Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?"
"Patrick"," I don't know. Can you?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star.  Patrick Star, room 801.  Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.  May I take your bags, Mr. Star?"
"Patrick"," I don't have any ba--  Oh... "
"SpongeBob"," Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way.  Your room, sir."
"Patrick"," Oh, dear."
"SpongeBob"," Something wrong, Mr. Star?"
"Patrick"," Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged."
"SpongeBob"," Arranged?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Star, are you sure about this? "
"Patrick"," No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls.  I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!"
"SpongeBob","  The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features."
"Patrick"," Ah a pool!  Where's the diving board?"
"SpongeBob"," The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up.  Your diving board, sir."
"Patrick"," All right! "
"SpongeBob"," You ok, sir?"
"Patrick","  My head is swimming just fine, thank you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no!  Lifeguard on duty!  You ok, sir?"
"Patrick","  So cold."
"SpongeBob"," This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation."
"Patrick"," So weak.  Strength... returning.  But I'm still hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Follow me, sir.  If you would take your seat, sir.  Your dining bib, sir. "
"Patrick"," Wow. What luxury. "
"SpongeBob"," One Krabby Patty coming up."
"Mr. Krabs","  What, no tip?"
"Patrick"," Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir.  Presenting the SpongeBob Follies.  What the hey."
"Patrick"," Boring.  Lame. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, what do you think?"
"Patrick"," You are smokin'!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, it was nothing."
"Patrick"," No, no, you're really smoking!"
"SpongeBob"," What?  Oh, no, the Krabby Patty! "
"Patrick"," My tummy is still lonely.  Ahh."
"Squidward","  Ah.  Ah, delish.  Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin.  And now an elegant meal for an elegant person. "
"Patrick"," I am quite refined.  Ah! "
"Squidward"," What are you doing here?"
"Patrick"," I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey waiter...  a napkin, please. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Star, your meal is ready.  Patrick, where is he?  Ah."
"Squidward"," Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!"
"Patrick"," Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa.  I could use a massage."
"Squidward"," Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!"
"Patrick","  Oh, yeah, that's the spot.  Hey, you should get a massage, too."
"Squidward","  Not likely.  Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?!  Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet."
"SpongeBob"," So tired.  Patrick, what are you doing here?"
"Patrick"," That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wake up, laddy."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You have another nasty old dream?"
"SpongeBob"," Mm-mmm."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick in your bed again?"
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye. Well, good night, laddy."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, sir."
"Plankton","  Salutations, puny mortals! I am the great genie of the slide carousel! WHOOOO! Endorse my vacation slides or I shall grant you three miseries!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, it's supposed to be three wishes."
"Plankton"," Silence, red one! Withstand my slides!"
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob","  Yay!"
"Plankton","  AAAAGHHH!! "
"SpongeBob"," Everything okay in there, oh great genie?"
"Plankton"," What are you, mocking me, kid? Of course everything's not okay. I can't show my slides!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's not the can-do spirit. "
"Plankton"," Now we're cooking with blubber! My second honeymoon, it started out as any romantic getaway would. With five days of round-the-clock surveillance..."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!  Oooh, a letter! Thank you, Mr. Mailman!"
"SpongeBob","  Ha ha ha ha! Mail call! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That-a-boy! Ar ar ar ar!  It's free tickets!"
"SpongeBob"," Free tickets to what, Mr. Krabs?  You and a guest have won a week of relaxation on a luxury ocean cruise ship!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wohoo! Works for me!  Gentlemen, I'm leaving you in-charge! See you when I see ya!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs, this says you and a guest!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, I suppose I could make that extra ticket available to, say, whoever is to be me man-servant?"
"SpongeBob","  Right this way, sir! "
"Plankton","  You might as well hand over that secret formula right now, 'cause once you shove off it's as good as mine! Ha ha ha! What in sea-bottoms?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Now look here, boy. I'm bringing along the secret formuler as a precaution, just in case our absence proves to temptin' to a certain one-eyed creepy-crawly."
"Plankton"," Well played, Krabs, well played indeed. But, as usual, this one-eyed creepy-crawly is one step ahead of you!  You can't beat Plan B, you can't beat it! Ah, this is going to be so sweet! Karen, we are going on a luxury cruise!"
"Plankton"," No, of course not!  Just think of it as our second honeymoon."
"Plankton"," Why don't I bump those vacation settings up a smidge? "
"Plankton","  Yeah, it's going to be groovy, babe. Now a quick check of the vacation inventory. Suntan lotion, sunglass, death laser..."
"Plankton"," See it?! It almost split me in half!"
"Plankton"," Gotta rethink that vacation algorithm when we get back."
"Plankton","  Nothing tops kicking back next to my loving computer wife and soaking up the rays."
"Plankton"," Let me give you a hand with that, honey. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whee, ah ha ha!"
"Plankton"," There he is, that swabby fool. Your turn now, Krabs."
"Plankton"," Um, oh, the d'oeuvre guy, he's late with my nibbles again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, ha ha ha! Now push me back to the top, push me to the top!"
"Plankton"," Is that Kelp Cheese? "
"Plankton"," Very funny, Karen. Perhaps you should of married a pile of cheese.  That's it!"
"Plankton","  Un! Eh! Un! Un! Eh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah ha ha! Whee! Ha ha ha! Ar ar ar ar!"
"Plankton","  AHHHH! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you hear that?  I could've sworn that I heard Plankteron!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, me too."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well. One more time around the deck!"
"Plankton"," I'm so exhausted! How's it going, honey?"
"Plankton"," Yeah, heh heh, sure is.  Uh, just sit back while I massage your wheels. "
"Plankton"," Sleep well, babe, he he he he."
"Plankton"," Whew, that was close. "
"Plankton"," AGGHHHHH!  I hate you, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wahoo!"
"Plankton"," You're not getting away this time!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm feeling lucky! "
"Plankton"," AGGHHHH!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Go Mr. Krabs!"
"Plankton"," I don't care anymore! Formula or no formula, I'm taking you down! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ar ar ar ar!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa! Aahh!"
"Plankton","  AAHHHHH!  Alright, alright! I give up! I know what I'm beat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oo, what's all this? Free Land Food, sounds so exotic.  Huh, this looks promising.  That tastes like putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, I don't know how anyone can stand this slop. It makes me miss our grub over back at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob, be a good man-servant and fix me up a Krabby Patty, would ya?"
"SpongeBob"," A good fry cook is never far from his grill, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He he hey! Looks like we have a business venture on our hands. This vacation just got a whole lot more lookerin' if you know what I'm sayin'. Krabby Patties! Come and get your Krabby Patties!"
"Plankton","  Ahem, good day sirs, I would like to pilfer your, I mean, purchase a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm, watch me sucker this guy. That will be a mere one hundred dollars."
"Plankton"," That's all? Why certainly, he he he. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come to daddy!  Hey, wait a minute, there's chum all over this bill. Hey, buddy! Where did you get this?"
"Plankton"," From the same place this is going, the Chum Bucket laboratory! Nice doing business, Krabs! he he he he! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nooooo!"
"SpongeBob"," Stand back, sir. Leave this to your trusty man-servant. "
"Plankton"," Ah ha ha ha ha!  Choke on that, you big..omf! "
"Plankton"," Well, technically it's your first."
"Plankton"," Bu...but I don't think that's such a good..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Me costumers! Aw, this vacation is a total bust!"
"Patrick","  So why are we going to Sandy's house?"
"SpongeBob"," To see her vacation slides for the hu..  Ow!"
"Patrick"," Who?...What?...Why?"
"Sandy","  Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think...  You see,  Someone already made six copies."
"Sandy"," Yes, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Who is this someone? Do we know him?"
"Sandy"," By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob.  Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing."
"Sandy","  Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay?  Good.  The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation.  And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute.  And this...  This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit. "
"SpongeBob","  ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy  I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪  Sandy...!  Whoa!"
"Sandy"," What do you think of my moon wagon?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?"
"Sandy"," Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a ""coincidence."" I'm getting ready for my vacation!"
"SpongeBob"," Where are you going?"
"Sandy"," The moon! "
"SpongeBob"," You're going on a moon trip?!"
"Sandy"," Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…"
"SpongeBob"," I'll be right back!"
"Sandy"," ...load up the moon wagon? "
"SpongeBob","  Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, I'm Number 12!"
"SpongeBob"," I need a bon voyage sheet cake.  Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! ""Have fun on the moon..."". What rhymes with ""moon""? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?"
"SpongeBob"," I got it! ""See you soon!”"
"SpongeBob"," No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake!  Whoa!"
"Sandy","  SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?"
"SpongeBob","  I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…"
"Sandy"," Nevermind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!"
"SpongeBob"," I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip!  Hey Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy..."
"Sandy"," Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I just wanted to show you the…"
"Sandy"," for the afterburners!  What were you saying, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake."
"Sandy"," You can't bring regular food into space!"
"SpongeBob"," Wha, wha, wha, why not?"
"Sandy"," Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Is that a bad thing?"
"Sandy"," Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive.  Ah nuts!"
"SpongeBob"," Oops. Sorry Sandy."
"Sandy","  Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks.  Aha! There's our problem.  Eh, could've used more nuts.  Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Roger that! Folding hands."
"Sandy"," Now, get ready for lunar module se…"
"SpongeBob","  What do you think Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Just don't touch anything while we separate."
"SpongeBob"," Ok."
"Sandy","  That looks like a good spot.  Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! "
"SpongeBob"," What's moon crater boarding?"
"Sandy"," You ride these on that like this.  Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah.  Right there is the classic Texas tail grab.  And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop.  Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite The Tour to Saturn.  Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn."
"SpongeBob"," Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary."
"Sandy"," Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try.  Sandy, this doesn't seem right."
"Sandy"," Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! "
"SpongeBob","  Ok. "
"Sandy"," Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick?  Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, this is kind of fun! "
"Patrick"," Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!"
"SpongeBob","  Watch this Sandy!  Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up…  puncture into the side of the rocket."
"Sandy"," You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”"
"SpongeBob"," Oops!"
"Sandy"," Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I have to do something very important!  There!  So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?"
"Sandy"," If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic.  Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!"
"SpongeBob"," Is that bad?"
"Sandy","  Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”."
"SpongeBob"," Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?!  Sandy, where are you going?"
"Sandy"," 'm going to take this bull by the horns! "
"SpongeBob"," Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?"
"Sandy"," Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere.  Yeehaw!"
"SpongeBob","  My goodness!"
"Sandy"," Yeehaw! Yeehaw!!! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay?  Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation."
"Sandy"," Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who's ready for some excitement?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who is ready for some fun?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm sure you know this charming fellow!  Here's the one that almost got away!  Look at these pile towers of golden green!  Here's how the whole thing started! "
"Squidward"," That will be $6.75 please. "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  You called Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab."
"Squidward"," Hallelujah! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Relax boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days.  Yesiree laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob.  Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think boy?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes! Please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! We'll have some fun! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me bottom dollar? Why I never do that!"
"SpongeBob"," La la la la la la la la la!"
"SpongeBob","  🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man!  Hey travel buddies!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along."
"SpongeBob","   Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!"
"SpongeBob","  I will happily honor this family tradition."
"Mr. Krabs"," See? You two are already having fun together! "
"Squidward","  And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!"
"Patrick","  Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you hear something?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!"
"SpongeBob","  Um, is time to come up yet?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!"
"Mr. Krabs","  The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!"
"SpongeBob"," Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!"
"SpongeBob","  Bathroom! Bathroom!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh... that's ok, honey. We weren't going there anyway. THAT'S where we're going!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this the most exciting day in you life?"
"SpongeBob"," Not really."
"SpongeBob"," Bill? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You hear that boy?  The entire money making... process!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I...  ...sure did sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Guah guah guah guah guah! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is starting at us.  Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh!  Uh... uh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of...  silver coins? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh! I thought this might happen! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us! "
"SpongeBob"," We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs?  Gasp!  MR. KRABS!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He he he he!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change!  Good one huh Mr. Krabs? AHHH!  Watch out Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours?  Do you believe in love at first sight?"
"SpongeBob","  Phew... that was close."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pretty neat huh boy? That's where they...  ...DESTROY MONEY?! NOOO!  NOOO! WHY? WHY? "
"SpongeBob","   It's ok sir. I'm sure I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Wah oh! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! It's ok!  The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See? "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's a miracle!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler! "
"SpongeBob"," That didn't work at all! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Grrrr... YAHHH! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good work boy!"
"SpongeBob"," You too sir!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! It's-"
"Mr. Krabs","  Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!"
"Mr. Krabs","   Shoes?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no... "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"SpongeBob"," Aah. Patrick, don't you love staring at clouds and thinking about what they look like?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it really calms my inner demons."
"SpongeBob","  Wow, look at that cloud.  It looks just like Sandy."
"Patrick"," I'm not seeing it. Ooh, check out that cloud!  It looks just like a... um, um, um, d'oh, it's coming, uh, looks like a... a cloud."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. It does. Hey, look at that one.  It looks just like Mr. Krabs, doesn't it?"
"Patrick"," Sure does! Um... who's Mr. Krabs again? Oh, now that cloud looks like a flying houseboat."
"SpongeBob"," Um, Patrick, I think that really is a flying houseboat."
"SpongeBob"," What is it, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," It's probably just one of those fake haunted houses, you know, for babies."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick, it's very scary-looking and spooky."
"Patrick"," It looks like fun, I'm going to check it out "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, wait for me! "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob, can you give me a boost?"
"Patrick"," A little to the left.  A little help? "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry up, lazy-bones! "
"Patrick"," Wow. Look at this place! It's so cheesy! Check out this lame doorknob."
"Patrick"," Let's check out inside."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, come on, don't be such a baby!  Wow, so lame!"
"Patrick","  Nice attention to detail, though. "
"Patrick"," Huh. So not scary!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, this is a nice picture! "
"Patrick"," Did you say something, SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I'll be right there!"
"Patrick"," Even the spiders are fake! I wish something would... pop out of a closet! Like a big, hairy hand!  That would be scary!  But this place is too low budget for that!  It would be cool, though, wouldn't it?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, that'd be  neato.  Patrick, where is that music coming from?"
"Patrick"," I think it's coming from that guy!"
"Patrick"," We do!"
"Patrick","  Look at the attention to detail in his mouth. It's so rotten and slimy.  His bad breath is incredible! His hair is very thin, too. It's dirty.  Eww. It reeks, and check out the workship on the jaw mechanism.  Remarkable-built quality!  Obviously a puppet or a robot! Hey, we must be in one of those pizza parlors, with one of those singing animated robots!"
"Patrick"," Sing us a song, robot!"
"Patrick"," Oh, whoops! You're right. I almost forgot. You're coin-operated, aren't you? "
"Patrick"," Uh-huh! Uh-huh!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't put yourself out for us!"
"Patrick"," Nope!"
"SpongeBob"," I do, Mr. dead pirate, sir!"
"Patrick"," This show is going to be so awesome."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, awesome "
"Patrick","  They're good!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary!"
"Patrick"," Where's my pizza? What kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow?"
"Patrick"," That's more like it! "
"SpongeBob"," We do! We do!"
"Patrick"," Oh, please don't kill me with your death ray eyes, Mr. Ghost Robot! Take my best friend instead! He's lived a full life!"
"SpongeBob"," Why have you come to Bikini Bottom, oh mighty dead person, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I didn't know you ghosts had gaskets in your heads!"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, uh, us?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, can we run screaming in horror from your ship now, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, after you!"
"SpongeBob"," One scoop, please."
"SpongeBob"," Ghosts, ghosts, a haunted houseboat!"
"Patrick","  Houseboat full of ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Eww, eww, eww, eww!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What in Neptune's name is going on?  Come back!  SpongeBob, what in the blue barnacles, are you up to?!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, it was awful! We just had a spooky encounter of the ghostly kind!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You had a what?"
"SpongeBob"," We were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky!"
"Patrick","  And it was full of ghosts! The really, real kind, not fake kind!"
"SpongeBob"," The captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket! And then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket! You gotta help us, Mr. Krabs! I feel so empty without my soul!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you say doubloon?  Let me see that! Hmm, looks somewhat authentic  Smells real enough! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers! We'll catch 'em and take their gold!"
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs! We don't know the first thing about ghost hunting!"
"Sandy"," I'll catch your ghosts for ya! It'll be easy with my new fangled critter-detector-catcher gizmo!"
"Squidward"," And you just happened to bring that with you... to the Krusty Krab?"
"Sandy"," Sure, I was looking for milkshake gremlins!"
"Sandy"," Nope, none in there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!"
"Squidward"," What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, Squidward! Think about what those treasures can do for the Krusty Krab, eh? Huh? Why, I can buy you that break room you've always wanted!"
"Squidward"," Okay, I'm in!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Super! Let's go catch us some treasure! So what do you say, SpongeBob! Are ya ready!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll go, but just to get my soul back."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?"
"SpongeBob"," So here it is. Pretty creepy, huh?"
"Sandy"," This place looks like it hasn't been lived in for years."
"Patrick"," Four years? Gotta be longer than that."
"Squidward"," I don't see any signs of ghosts  Nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art.  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Look, Mr. Krabs! The doubloons!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ha-ha-ha "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I wouldn't touch that if I were you! That gold probably has ghost germs all over it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob! There's no such things as germs.  Heads up, Squidward!  Hey, Patrick, think fast!"
"Patrick"," Think? "
"Mr. Krabs"," All righty, then. Let's get while the getting's good! Ooh!  Looks like I missed one! Uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh... "
"SpongeBob"," It's just us, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir. We brought the replacement gasket you asked for. So if it's not too much trouble, do you think you could give us our souls back... now... maybeee."
"SpongeBob"," Aah. That hits the spot!"
"Patrick"," Again?"
"Patrick"," My soul. "
"Patrick"," Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat."
"SpongeBob"," But what about our real souls?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pfttttt! You ghosts don't scare me! You're nothing but thin air! Grab your sacks and follow me, boys!  Noooooooooooooooooooo!"
"Patrick"," Get me out of here!"
"Squidward"," Nooooooooooooooooooo!"
"Patrick"," Nooooooooooooooooo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. So this is limbo. Well, at least I have a sack full of doubloons to spend eternity with. Uh-oh. Gotta use the can!  Ooh. There's a bit of luck. A portable potty. What's this here? ""Insert doubloon?"" Nooooooooooooo!"
"Patrick"," Wow. This void sure is relaxing!  Hey! I've got a doughnut on my head! Come here, you.  Hey! Get back here!  Why is this happening to me?"
"Patrick"," Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts."
"Patrick"," Um, I like sprinkles!"
"Patrick"," No, chocolate! No, a bagel! No-no-no-no, pancakes! No-no-no..."
"Patrick"," Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!"
"Squidward"," Oh, great. I wonder what my vision of eternal suffering will be!  Of course!"
"Squidward"," I guess this is the part where I start screaming. "
"Sandy"," Hey, corpse breath! You better let my friends out of there if you know what's good for ya!"
"Sandy"," Oh, you'll be laughing out the other side of your tombstone once you've had a taste of my ghost-catcher!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks, lassie. Now, let's just get this here bag of doubloons back to the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, you thieving bilge rat! I stole this gold fair and square! "
"SpongeBob"," I got it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me gold!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that's funny! Hmm, this chest says it belongs to the Flying Dutchman!"
"Sandy"," The Flying Dutchman?! You ain't afraid he's gonna want it back?"
"SpongeBob","  It is my civic duty to report stolen property!"
"Squidward"," Welcome to my world."
"Sandy"," Frog whiskers! The Dutchman's on our tail!"
"Sandy"," The Dutchman's gaining on us!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that!"
"Patrick"," Here's your milkshake, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," Got ya, you little gremlin!"
"Mr. Krabs"," How's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Everyone's paying with bones."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, money's money!"
"Squidward"," No, I mean actual bones."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. Those must be worth something down here."
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward! Everybody hold onto something! It's time to flip the patties! Hit it!"
"SpongeBob","  We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon."
"Patrick"," Let's do this!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, how are we on snacks?"
"Patrick"," Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through...  the first hour."
"SpongeBob"," Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?  Check. Drapes?"
"Patrick"," Check. "
"SpongeBob"," Lampshade?"
"Patrick"," Check. "
"SpongeBob"," Thermometer?  Check. Ukelele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?"
"Patrick","  Check."
"SpongeBob"," And... "
"SpongeBob"," It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have... "
"SpongeBob"," No...  NO!  No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now? "
"Squidward"," Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits.  ...what? Circuit must've blown again. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick. All the TV's in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Thanks for nothing, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans! "
"SpongeBob","  We made it!  Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair! "
"Patrick"," We wanna watch your TV!"
"Patrick"," But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret ""gorinin""? "
"SpongeBob"," Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!"
"Patrick"," ...Yeah, so?"
"SpongeBob"," So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?"
"Patrick"," Whoa! You're like a brain professor!"
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, how'd you two meet?"
"SpongeBob","  Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, this is it!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!"
"Patrick"," This is gonna be so super awesome!"
"SpongeBob"," So superhero awesome!"
"SpongeBob"," The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job, laddy, another fruitful day pushing patties."
"SpongeBob"," Push-a-what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, turning patties into lettuce. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I'm not following you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Cabbage, green backs, money!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you mean your obsession."
"Mr. Krabs"," Obsession is kind of a strong word.  Sleep tight, me little angels. "
"Plankton"," 35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open, says me!  Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order. The safe is still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things. Hey, how'd that pickle end up on the floor?  Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. Waste not, whnt not."
"Plankton"," Trust me, you do not want to know."
"Plankton"," No, and I probably never will."
"Plankton"," Oh Karen, if only you could just see things way I do. "
"Plankton"," What?"
"Plankton"," Maybe you're right. That would explain why I stink at darts."
"Plankton"," Karen, my dear, I think you're onto something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!"
"Plankton","  Success!  Uh oh, that ain't good.  No, no, no, no no no nо nо nо no! I can see every- "
"Plankton"," Binocular vision, here I come!   What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you!  Oh, come on, please stop!  Next."
"Plankton"," Karen, what am I doing wrong?"
"Plankton"," It's not love is it?  Cause you know I hate that stuff."
"Plankton"," Tears, huh? I guess if I have to.  Ow! Will these do?"
"Plankton"," 2 eyes, huh? I think I know a cry baby who fits that description!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Plankton!"
"Plankton","  Hey SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?"
"SpongeBob"," No, not particularly."
"Plankton"," Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt.The end."
"SpongeBob","  S-s-s-sad story! And so timely! "
"Plankton"," Get a grip!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk! "
"Plankton"," Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!  Mommy! Here comes the pain!  That wasn't so bad. Uh oh, here we go.  Eureka!"
"Plankton"," You tell me.  Bullseye! Now for my next target – the Krabby Patty secret formula!  Hahahaha!  Wha-?  Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful!"
"SpongeBob"," La la la la!"
"Plankton"," Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?"
"Plankton"," I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day! "
"SpongeBob"," OK, buh-bye!"
"Plankton"," Honey, I'm home!"
"Plankton"," Formula, what formula?  I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me."
"Plankton"," Nonsense, You're imagining things."
"Plankton"," Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!"
"Plankton"," Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!"
"Plankton"," Uhh..."
"Plankton"," A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?"
"Plankton"," Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula. "
"Plankton"," Such lovely destruction!"
"Plankton"," I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!"
"Plankton"," Oh no. "
"Plankton"," Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula.  What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Uh-wha.. Krabs must have lost it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir, Mr. Krabs! "
"Plankton"," Hey Eugene! You missing anything? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me Krabby Patty Formula!"
"Plankton"," That's right Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground!  So I'm giving it back to you, take it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns.  Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?"
"Plankton"," Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Since when do you care about stealing?"
"Plankton"," Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again.  Hahaha, I did it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh huh. "
"Plankton"," My life of evil is over.  Hey, why is it so dark in here?"
"Plankton"," The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, never!"
"SpongeBob","  This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!"
"Plankton"," What, no! Not hugs!  It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, glad I could help."
"Plankton"," Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers!  Oh well. Depth perception's overrated anyway. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Didn't you already mop this area?"
"SpongeBob","  Affirmative, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, then, why would you mop it again?"
"SpongeBob"," Why wouldn't I? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good point."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oooh, that is terrible.  Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Why ever not?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you...  Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Anything for me beloved angel!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  At ease!  How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?"
"SpongeBob"," I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!"
"SpongeBob"," One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again."
"SpongeBob"," I took him to see a hypnotist."
"SpongeBob"," No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again."
"SpongeBob"," What did I say?"
"SpongeBob","  He was a really good hypnotist."
"SpongeBob"," Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it."
"SpongeBob","  Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. "
"SpongeBob","  I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work! "
"SpongeBob","  Gettin' there."
"SpongeBob"," Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob","  Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?"
"SpongeBob","  I mean, you're right. There's more."
"SpongeBob","  Hmm... Water and... this soap?"
"SpongeBob","  Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?"
"SpongeBob","  More for me!"
"SpongeBob","  No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Pearl, I'm home! "
"SpongeBob"," Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewels!"
"SpongeBob"," Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano."
"SpongeBob"," I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Where do you keep your soap?"
"SpongeBob","  Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, it's my old soap press!"
"SpongeBob"," Soap press?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!"
"SpongeBob"," Leftover Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free."
"SpongeBob","  Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabby Patty essence."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose-"
"Mr. Krabs","  Got to go, keep your cellphone!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea..."
"SpongeBob","  All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  And, ta-da. What do you think?"
"SpongeBob","  We shall see shortly."
"SpongeBob","  Shh. Trust me."
"SpongeBob"," You have a good time, carefree teens!"
"Mr. Krabs","  My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Help! Police! Thief!  Stop that whale!"
"SpongeBob"," I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, boy, the mail's here!  What do we have today?  Gas bill... taxes... letter to SpongeBob from  Gramma! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gramma's turning even older! I can't wait to celebrate!  Sorry, Gary, I am gonna miss you when I'm gone...but, if I'm not here, who's going to take care of you?"
"Squidward","  Hmhmhmhm..."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  My daddy is going away. Can you take care of me...eow? "
"Squidward"," Oh, no. No way! Look what that disgusting pest did to my sustainable kelp garden!  He chewed it up, ruined it!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, is that true?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'll see you later, Squidward. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick!  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick"," I'm talking to my friend, Funny.  Hi, Funny!"
"SpongeBob"," Heh, yeah. Hey, Patrick, I need to ask a favor of you."
"Patrick"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," I need you to take care of Gary."
"Patrick"," Are you going off the grid?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick"," Don't worry, I know what I do. You're gonna need one of these. "
"SpongeBob"," No, that's not it! I am going to see my Gramma for her birthday, and I'm trusting my best pal to watch carefully over Gary when I'm gone."
"Patrick"," You got it. He's safe with me! "
"SpongeBob","  Ok, Patrick. There you are!"
"Patrick","  What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," It's a chronological list of all the things you need to do with Gary. Make sure you do each and every one."
"Patrick","  Got it! Hey, do you have any more of those deep fried cream filled sugar-coded coral balls?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. They're in the cupboard."
"Patrick","  Ooh, coral balls."
"SpongeBob","   I'm gonna miss you, little guy. But I know you are going to be in good hands."
"Patrick","  You can't get to my stomach now, white coral ball. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, Gary. I'll be home by ten.  Dear Patrick, just do verify.  First, you feed Gary, then you pet Gary, then you-"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob!  Don't you trust me? I am the most responsible guy you know!"
"SpongeBob","  You know what? You're right."
"Patrick"," Well, of course I am!  Now, go see your Gramma. Gary's in good hands.  Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend."
"Patrick"," Hmmm... I wonder what we should do first.  You need to work on your handwriting, SpongeBob. I don't need this anyway.  Oh! I know! Let's go for a walk! "
"Patrick","  Oh. Looks like my tummy is having an argument with the coral balls. Ohhh... "
"Patrick","  Better. "
"Patrick"," Oh, hey, friend! What's up?"
"Patrick"," Step aside, Barry. Let me show you how it's done.  Ooh. Gotta try a bite of this.  Ahh.  Good stuff."
"Patrick"," I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gramma, you shouldn't have. It's your birthday, I should be serving you!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary. Oh, Gary. "
"Patrick"," He's safe with me. "
"SpongeBob","  Gramma, can I please use your phone?"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. "
"Patrick","  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's SpongeBob. How's Gary?"
"Patrick"," Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine."
"SpongeBob","  Sounds like you got everything under control. Oh, and make sure to give Gary his bath. "
"Patrick","  Whew! SpongeBob was right. You need a bath!  Oh! I almost forgot.  Snail food!"
"Patrick","  Gotta get the water to stay in there somehow.  Now, Gary, we don't eat the bath. We get in the bath.  Come on, Gary.  Oh, don't be difficult now, Gary.  Gary!  There you are!  Oh, what now?  SquarePants household."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles."
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," And remember to dry him off really good."
"Patrick"," All right."
"SpongeBob"," And don't forget about the list!"
"Patrick","  Okay, I get it, SpongeBob! I get it, I get it!  No!  I don't get these new beguiled shower heads.   Gary! Time for your-   Wait a minute, Patrick! You gotta trick the snail!  You gotta be smarterer than him!  Hey, buddy! I got something cool to show you. And it's the opposite of a wet watery bath.  Take it down! "
"Patrick"," Doesn't that look fun?"
"Patrick"," Well, make up your mind! Is it water or fire?  Okay, Gary. If you don't come to the bath, then the bath's gonna come to you.  That's a good boy! Now, suds up!  "
"Patrick"," That wasn't so bad, now was it?"
"Patrick","  Oh, now we gotta dry you off. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any salt. So, I'll have to use the next best thing!  There! Doesn't that feel better? Okay!  Let's see, Gary's eaten, he's had his bath, Time to watch the T.V.!  Sheesh, Gary! Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?"
"SpongeBob","  ♪ Happy Birthday dear old Gramma, Gramma, Gramma! The best Gramma in the world, Gramma, Gramma! ♪ "
"SpongeBob","   Gramma, can I use your phone again?"
"Patrick","  SquareyPants' house."
"SpongeBob"," Just checking, is everything okay over there?"
"Patrick","  Who is this?"
"SpongeBob","  It's SpongeBob. Is Gary all right?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah. He's- "
"SpongeBob","  He's what? He's what, Patrick? Gary is what?!  What is happening to them?!  They need my help!  Gramma! Gramma!"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh, better get you to bed now. Good night, Gramma! "
"SpongeBob","  Hang on, Gary!  Gary!  What's the matter, buddy?  Ahhh... reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see. ""Snail Tales,"" that's a good one."
"Patrick","  ""Snail Tales""? I thought it was called, ""Meow, meow, meow."""
"SpongeBob"," Good morning to you too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab. "
"SpongeBob"," Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater. "
"SpongeBob"," We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get... "
"SpongeBob"," AAAAHHHHH! Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me?  Aaaaaah!! Today is Sunday?! But that means..."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today.  The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays.  Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have?  Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!"
"Sandy"," That's right, SpongeBob. I know it's last minute, but..."
"SpongeBob","  I would love to. "
"Sandy"," Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation.  SpongeBob, are you getting all this?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Sandy"," Here's a comprehensive list of ""do""s and ""don't""s to follow. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge."
"Sandy","  That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"Sandy"," Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do..."
"SpongeBob"," Wow...!"
"Sandy"," ...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal. "
"SpongeBob"," ""Nor... mal."" Got it.  "
"Sandy"," And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots."
"SpongeBob"," That stands to reason."
"Sandy"," This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing.  You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I respect your meticulous nature."
"Sandy","  Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  What's next on the list?"
"Sandy"," This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway.  And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands."
"Sandy"," Are you sure?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep."
"Sandy"," Are you really sure?"
"SpongeBob"," Really sure."
"Sandy"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob","  Normal.  2,692...  2,693...  2,694...  Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute.  Aha!  There... we go.  Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here.  What the...?  Ohhh!! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for...  ...weeks! What is going on?!  Oh! Patrick? "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! There you are!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks."
"Patrick"," Nah, no, thanks. I had a late breakfast."
"SpongeBob"," Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?"
"Patrick"," Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for...  P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe! "
"Patrick"," There you go.  "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick,  I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome."
"Patrick"," E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!"
"SpongeBob"," That's right. Exit the tree..."
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we go—Jellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun."
"Patrick"," All right, let's go!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility."
"Patrick"," Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you."
"SpongeBob"," Nnnnope."
"Patrick"," Pleeease?"
"SpongeBob"," Not gonna happen."
"Patrick"," Pretty please?"
"SpongeBob"," No way."
"Patrick"," Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, right."
"Patrick"," Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what do you take me for?"
"Patrick"," AND A SCOOP OF NUTS!!"
"SpongeBob"," Deal."
"Patrick","  Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," But you have to promise not to touch anything."
"Patrick","  I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything."
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex...  PATRICK!  Patrick, no!! You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything."
"Patrick","  I wasn't touching anything!"
"SpongeBob"," Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!"
"Patrick"," Um... Tasting it."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear?  Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick? "
"Patrick"," Is this close enough?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do."
"Patrick"," Not... touch anything."
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm. What else."
"Patrick"," Not do anything."
"SpongeBob"," And"
"Patrick"," Not... look at anything."
"SpongeBob"," Until when? Until...?"
"Patrick"," Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting."
"SpongeBob","  Good boy, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick how many times do I have to---"
"Patrick"," It wasn't me!"
"SpongeBob"," Well I I guess I can't handle it after all I I'm a failure. "
"Patrick"," Hey buddy, it's not as bad as it seems."
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah, what makes you say that?"
"Patrick"," Well, not everything is broken."
"SpongeBob","   Sa..S...S..San....Sandy?  How was the inventors convention?"
"Patrick"," Did you bring back any souvenirs?"
"Sandy"," Funny, y'all should ask that."
"SpongeBob"," It is?"
"Sandy"," Yep. I brought home something real handy."
"Sandy"," And i'm setting it to maximum power."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye."
"Patrick"," At a handsome squirrel?"
"Sandy"," Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success."
"Sandy"," That's right boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist. "
"Patrick"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!"
"Patrick"," It wasn't me."
"Sandy"," Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster."
"SpongeBob"," Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy?   Sandy? "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Squidward","  Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab.  Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him."
"SpongeBob"," Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique."
"Squidward"," Kelpy's not for everyone."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are…  sorry, sold out."
"Squidward"," Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?"
"SpongeBob"," You forgot to buy a ticket?"
"Squidward"," Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there.  Oh wait, I just realized…I'll be having the greatest time of my life!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?"
"Squidward"," Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it! "
"SpongeBob"," You're probably not gonna get that back before show time."
"Squidward"," Oh, the dream is still alive! "
"Squidward"," Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam."
"SpongeBob"," I am? "
"SpongeBob"," Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be."
"SpongeBob"," Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G! "
"Squidward"," Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits."
"SpongeBob"," You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 1000 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!"
"Squidward"," Me? No. Of course not. No."
"Squidward"," See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show."
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir."
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, just look at that lemonade line."
"Squidward"," That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," It's right behind you SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Why don't I get one for you?"
"Squidward"," Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—"
"Squidward"," Well, okay, if you insist."
"SpongeBob"," Alright. One lemonade, coming up."
"Squidward","  See you after the show, Spongee-G."
"Squidward","  Ah, ""Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance."" I just love this tune."
"Squidward"," Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G."
"Squidward"," Don't mind if I do groove."
"SpongeBob","  Look what I found!"
"Squidward"," What the…? What?"
"SpongeBob"," Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, nice tune.  Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you friends with Squidward?"
"Squidward"," But I dazzle. Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Squidward"," Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself."
"Patrick","  Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup."
"Squidward"," No I don't—ketchup?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what brought you here?"
"Patrick"," Two words, SpongeBob— ""na"" ""chos."""
"Squidward"," Two words, Patrick— ""get lost."""
"Patrick","  What's that?"
"Squidward"," Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa— huh? "
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa— "
"Patrick"," Tummy want more. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy."
"Squidward","  I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half.  What the…?"
"Patrick","  I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes.  Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now. "
"Squidward"," Hey, come back here with those backstage passes."
"Squidward"," But our friend just took our—"
"Squidward"," Oh, well, at least we still have our seats. "
"Squidward"," Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya?  You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this—  Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G."
"Patrick"," Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub. "
"Squidward"," We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience."
"Squidward"," ""No backstage passes, no entry."""
"Squidward"," Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!"
"Squidward"," But, but, but… what if I told you, uh… I'm a clarinet player myself.  I call this one, ""Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars."" Wait. Hold for it. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Oh! "
"Squidward"," Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet— "
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob SquarePants."
"Squidward"," This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy.  But I'm a musician!"
"Patrick"," After you."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, thank you Patrick. "
"Patrick"," My turn. "
"SpongeBob"," Neato.  Watch this. "
"Patrick","  Wow.  Monosodium glutamate! "
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing."
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... "
"Patrick"," I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes."
"Squidward","   20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!"
"Squidward"," What? What? Who said that?"
"Squidward"," Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?"
"Squidward"," ""Avenge me?""  SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," I must have more."
"SpongeBob"," You want more? "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob you moron, you ruined my bon…  ...sai. "
"SpongeBob"," Let's go to Sandy's."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented."
"Patrick"," Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe even smarter."
"Sandy"," Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy."
"Patrick"," Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb."
"SpongeBob"," I know Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. "
"Sandy"," That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. "
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oops."
"Sandy"," I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks."
"SpongeBob"," Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door. "
"Patrick"," Even I knew that was dumb."
"Sandy"," Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?"
"Patrick"," I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!"
"Sandy"," Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules."
"Patrick"," She's totally losing it."
"Sandy","  Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face."
"Patrick"," Never mind. She seems fine."
"SpongeBob"," Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight. "
"Sandy"," Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut. "
"SpongeBob"," Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Don't worry. She's not going anywhere."
"Sandy"," Ahh...  You taste like glass. "
"SpongeBob","  Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with."
"Patrick"," Get what over with?"
"SpongeBob"," Where's Sandy"
"Patrick"," I thought she was with you."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh. "
"Sandy"," Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, what are you doing? The air is up there."
"Sandy"," Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw."
"Sandy"," Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. "
"SpongeBob"," No Sandy, you need air, not food! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! What's going on out here?"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. ""O2,"" I believe. Good old atomic number eight."
"Sandy"," "
"Patrick"," Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling."
"Mr. Krabs"," But how are you gonna get them down? "
"SpongeBob"," Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back. "
"Patrick"," Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I'm ready. "
"Patrick"," Just a little bit further. Okay, got it. "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry up, Patrick. "
"Sandy"," Hm-mmm. "
"Patrick"," Looks like her color's coming back. "
"SpongeBob"," That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air. "
"Squidward"," I said what? "
"Mr. Krabs"," So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy. "
"SpongeBob","  No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right? "
"SpongeBob"," And you breathe air, right? "
"SpongeBob"," You've got t.o help Sandy. She needs to share your air."
"Sandy"," "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down."
"Patrick"," But how are you going to get up there?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket."
"Patrick"," An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," I know. Wish me luck, old friend. "
"Patrick","  SquarePants, I salute you."
"SpongeBob","  Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down. "
"Patrick"," Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghosts! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, here we go. "
"Patrick"," Ah, ah! Oof! "
"SpongeBob","  Welcome back, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble. "
"Sandy"," Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing any more bubbles around my house."
"SpongeBob","  Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves,  oh, Sandy, aaah...  Sandy is in trouble, don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you! "
"Sandy"," That's my friend SpongeBob SquarePants."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa...what was that stench?"
"SpongeBob","  You know kah-ra-tay?"
"Sandy"," He just doesn't know karate, he IS karate.  He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns. Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate."
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, you already have a black belt."
"Sandy"," Yes but there's one even higher than that!  The blacker belt!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee...I wish I had a karate belt"
"SpongeBob"," Okay? How do I do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Hm?"
"SpongeBob"," Um...sorry. I'm confused."
"Sandy"," What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not."
"SpongeBob"," But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?"
"SpongeBob","  Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay."
"SpongeBob"," Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life! "
"SpongeBob"," In turn I will! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wait! Sensei!"
"Sandy","  Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow! "
"SpongeBob"," My match!  I can't get outta here!"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Here...I'm right here... I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired..."
"Sandy"," You sure you want to do this buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!"
"Sandy","  Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay Sandy!  Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper! "
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Sandy"," Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate."
"SpongeBob"," Easy for you to say Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles."
"Sandy"," Hey! You can't do that!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes Sensei..."
"Sandy"," That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend."
"Sandy"," I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!"
"Sandy"," That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!"
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward I...I failed my karate exam..."
"Squidward"," Sigh...which is why I keep telling you Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!"
"SpongeBob"," Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right! "
"Sandy"," You sure you don't need an air helmet?"
"Sandy"," How about them moves?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!"
"SpongeBob"," Twenty! Got it Squidward! "
"Sandy"," Well, that took some agility!"
"Sandy"," Now you're convinced!"
"Sandy"," Hey, SpongeBob! I like my patty in twelfths, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay! There you go Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Told ya!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh! I forgot the fries! "
"SpongeBob","  Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here.  It's the onions! They've gone bad! "
"Sandy"," That's showing him, SpongeBob!  You gonna give him a belt Fuzzy? Or have you not had enough yet?"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, looking good!"
"SpongeBob"," Make the fires! I almost forgot! "
"Squidward"," More Patties!"
"SpongeBob"," Grilling them now!  Your fries, sir!  And your fries, sir! Ketchup?  Oops!  Got it! Gasp! Fuzzy!"
"Sandy"," Oh no!"
"SpongeBob"," Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?"
"SpongeBob"," For me? Thanks Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible!  Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?"
"Sandy"," I know what he needs! He just needs this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  Whooh!  There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there!  I knew this place looked familiar.  What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's Treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look.  Good afternoon, Miss Sandy."
"Sandy"," And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year."
"Sandy"," Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long."
"Sandy"," Come on in then. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Seems so much bigger once your inside."
"Sandy"," That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually..."
"Sandy","  Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that."
"Sandy"," Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tell me about your giant soybean."
"Sandy"," This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people."
"Mr. Krabs","  Or a supply of entire rest---. "
"Sandy"," Once the testing is complete, the growth serum could be used to do a lot of good things."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Sandy"," Sure would hate to see it fallen into the wrong hands. Someone who might just use it to try and get-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Rich! I'll be rich!"
"Sandy"," What's that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, could I borrow your telephone?  Heh, it's ringing."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I came as soon as I got the call!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh, did you bring a Krabby Patty like I was planning to ask you to do?"
"SpongeBob","  Aye aye, captain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Perfect! Okay Sandy, administer the growth serum."
"Sandy"," I don't know, Mr. Krabs. I can't predict what's going to happen."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you did say it needs further testing. Test it on the Krabby Patty."
"Sandy"," Well, I suppose so. But only a single drop."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fair enough.  Is it suppose to smell like that?"
"Sandy"," If you two will excuse me, I need to pay a quick visit to a little squirrel's room.  Would you mind holding these while I'm gone? I'll only be a minute."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh no, we don't mind.  Heh heh heh, there."
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy said-"
"Mr. Krabs","  Sh sh sh sh sh sh sh.  Thanks for the tour, Sandy, see you later! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Waste of a perfectly Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great, let's get into the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Patty... becoming... awkward..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, here, here.  Put it in this grocery bag."
"SpongeBob"," Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The grocery store."
"SpongeBob"," So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh heh, who cares. It's an endless supply of free patties! And cook them fast, boy!  We got customers!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! Are you going to cook that thing or just stand there staring at it? "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward. Coming right up!  Order up, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," All right, keep them coming! "
"SpongeBob"," You betcha! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one.  There we go. "
"Squidward"," Ok, that's great SpongeBob, but you don't have to knock me in the-  BAGEGAH! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, why did you make that weird noi-  Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen!  Nooooooo! Huh?  Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!"
"Squidward","  Do you always go barefoot at work, or have I just never noticed before?"
"SpongeBob","  Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward, behind you!  Abandon ship! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it! And just what is it you two think you're doing?"
"Squidward"," The restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. We're getting outta here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa ho, this is a dream come true! You can't just leave!"
"Squidward"," Oh, do you have a better idea?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay?... And work?"
"Squidward"," Okay, you go right ahead. But I'd rather stay alive than stay at work. That means you- "
"Mr. Krabs"," Cashy! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, look out!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aaah! "
"Squidward","  I think it's our break time, don't you? "
"Plankton","  What's this?  Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?!  Ah, I'd better get a closer look.   Out of my way, you fools!"
"SpongeBob","  Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!"
"Plankton","  I can't hear you! I need to see this!  Holy mother of all creatures great and small!  It's the largest Krabby Patty the world has ever seen! It's... it's... gorgeous...  Oh, great patty! Take me! Take me home, daddy! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!"
"Patrick"," Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," That wasn't a dream!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! What do we do?"
"SpongeBob"," We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!"
"Patrick"," I don't think she's home, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy, where are you?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?"
"Sandy"," No, SpongeBob! Up here!  And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, what happened to your treedome?"
"Sandy"," Well, that giant soybean got too big, so I chopped it up into a giant salad. Anyone got any giant croutons?"
"Patrick"," ...I think I'm gonna be sick."
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong, Patrick? Airsickness?"
"Patrick"," No...the thought of a salad that size is more than I can handle."
"Sandy"," And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty."
"SpongeBob"," Really? How?"
"Sandy"," The puzzle cube told me. The key to defeating the patty is you, SpongeBob! All I have to do is get you closer to the patty so that you can make direct contact."
"SpongeBob"," Direct contact!? Are you sure?"
"Sandy"," The puzzle cube never lies."
"Sandy"," Alright, we have visual. Putting you into position, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, bye. "
"SpongeBob"," Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait, what was I supposed to do again?"
"Sandy"," Just make direct contact!"
"SpongeBob"," Direct contact, you mean like this? "
"Sandy"," It's working! Keep going! You can do it!"
"SpongeBob"," Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain."
"SpongeBob"," Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body, come to think of it!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok...what do I do now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Step right up folks! For a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Two! Medium-rare!"
"SpongeBob","  Copy that. Over."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! Don't crowd! While supplies last, don't be shy! Come on!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see Dear, SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," ♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends."
"Squidward"," No, I don't! "
"SpongeBob"," You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun."
"SpongeBob","  So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!"
"Squidward"," Would you please get your friend out of my house?"
"Squidward"," Where is he?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  You don't think he p-p-popped in there?"
"Squidward"," There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!"
"Squidward"," Phew..."
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha! "
"Squidward"," Of course."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!"
"SpongeBob"," Shiny, no!"
"SpongeBob"," Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window! "
"SpongeBob","  I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Morning, Laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?"
"SpongeBob"," This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble."
"Mr. Krabs","  Put it there!  Hey! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come here you little rascal! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry."
"SpongeBob"," Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer."
"Squidward"," What in the name of Neptune is going on- "
"SpongeBob"," There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt."
"Mr. Krabs"," You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money."
"SpongeBob"," That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the ""let's do nothing at all"" game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-"
"SpongeBob"," Shiny? Shiny where are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get going and keep you away from sharp pointy things."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, tartar sauce. Shiny, no!"
"SpongeBob"," ""Bikini Bottom Pin Factory""? Don't worry, Shiny. I'm coming!  Shiny, you have to be more careful. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose. "
"SpongeBob"," Shiny, where are you going?  ""Scissor Works""? Hold on, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Did you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed! "
"SpongeBob"," Shiny?  ""Pitchfork Pantry."" Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Now, let's see if there's a safe place for you to visit. Ah! ""The Pillow Foundry"" That's a safe place to visit. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house."
"SpongeBob"," Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know! "
"SpongeBob","  Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, man!  Phew, that was close."
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he's...  ...doing great."
"SpongeBob"," Again?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil sort of way."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, bye. Anytime you need a baby-sitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy."
"Squidward"," What the...?  SpongeBob, do you mind!?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?"
"Squidward","  What am I doing!? What are you doing!?"
"SpongeBob"," I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?"
"Squidward"," Cala-what?"
"SpongeBob"," Walking to work, huh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Go away."
"SpongeBob"," Can I walk with you?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Please?"
"Squidward"," No.  I said NO! I will not walk to work with yo--! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!"
"Squidward"," Okay. And would you like cheese on-- "
"Squidward","  What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear.  SpongeBob!  It's empty!  See empty!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? "
"Squidward"," Well let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on."
"Squidward"," Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is... "
"SpongeBob"," I gotta do something.  Okay, Squidward, this should help.  Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you.  I can fix this.  This time I got ya. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Me soda machine!!! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You really sent him over the edge this time."
"SpongeBob"," Technically, I drove him up the wall."
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you."
"SpongeBob","  Present? A present? For me?"
"Squidward"," Now now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward! My very own... restraining order. Uh...what is that?"
"Squidward"," Perhaps my lawyers should explain. "
"SpongeBob"," Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during ""serious jail time""?"
"Squidward"," And. "
"SpongeBob","  No! I don't wanna go!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to, or get within fifteen feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?"
"SpongeBob","  Hmm... There we go! 3 Krabby Patties, 2 large Kelpy Colas, and 3 fries ready to be served.  Hmm?  Oops!  Sorry about that Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see that!  Thank you! Look boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart! "
"SpongeBob","  Think SpongeBob think! Gasp! I got it!"
"Patrick","  Hehe."
"Squidward","  Oh if I ignore it, maybe it will go away."
"Patrick","  Hehe."
"Squidward"," I thought not  Oh-kay Patrick. What? What? What!"
"Patrick","  Notice anything...  Different? Huh? Huh? A hint! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick! I am not not paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, Patrick! Get back to...what? Work? Oh no! No! No! No! Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why all the shivering of the timbers, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It'll stand. Oh, unless you'd rather talk with SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Patrick"," Can I watch you work?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Please? ."
"Squidward"," No!"
"Patrick"," Pretty please?"
"Squidward"," No! No! No! No!   Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!   Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward..."
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Time for your break. "
"Squidward"," Ah...don't mind if I do.  Ah...no better way to spend a break then with a little cool jazz.  Huh?"
"Patrick","  Hi Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Hello...you..."
"Patrick"," I just finished cleaning the restroom!"
"Squidward","  Ooh...that's great..."
"Patrick"," I mopped the floors! I shined the mirrors! I scrubbed the sinks."
"Squidward","  Wonderful."
"Patrick"," Oh yeah!  But we are going to need a new toilet plunger. This one's broken."
"Squidward"," Patrick! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward."
"Squidward","  Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order..."
"Squidward"," That depends..."
"Squidward"," How long you want to live? "
"Patrick","  Hah hah! Squidward's funny!  Hey, a button!"
"Squidward","  Seaberries? I'm allergic to... Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do!  SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," You're the prettiest button I've ev... Huh? Monster!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," It's after SpongeBob!  You're right button! No monster is going to eat our friend!   "
"Squidward"," No, no no no wait!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! My two best friends are fighting!  But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off!  I'm sorry, restraining order! But my friends need me!  Stop!"
"Squidward","  Give me that restraining order!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," Alright, right, let's look at this."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, please don't send me to jail!"
"Patrick","  Squidward?  Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well when were you going to tell me?"
"SpongeBob","  I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"
"Squidward"," Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen."
"SpongeBob","  Here you go. "
"Squidward"," Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not? "
"Squidward"," No! I'm releasing you from this order. "
"SpongeBob"," Really, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," ...And adding someone who is much more deserving!"
"Patrick"," Sorry, button."
"Squidward"," No, Patrick! You! "
"Patrick"," Oh!!! AH HAH HAH HAH HAH!"
"Patrick","  Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished, I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?"
"Squidward","  Hark, the odor you seek is before you."
"Mr. Krabs","  At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  And served with a smile by our friendly waiter. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, cause you're the mascot."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nah, I don't think so!  We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesday! "
"Squidward"," Oh, for dolphins sakes!! Do tell what's troubling you so!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping."
"Squidward"," Shocking."
"SpongeBob"," I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmic."
"Squidward"," Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," That'll keep him out of my hair.  Of course, he actually has one.  To each, his own."
"Squidward"," Yes, your freakishness. "
"Squidward"," Good riddance.  What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  Sweet Neptune! Could that have been..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward. "
"Squidward"," That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, let's not overdo it."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist!  He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker."
"Squidward"," It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!"
"SpongeBob","  Ohh, what is this?"
"Squidward","  This is an authentic Fiasco!"
"Squidward"," Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold it!   I'll take a million for it."
"Squidward","  It's not yours to sell! I found it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco."
"Squidward"," You tried to throw it away!  It's mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece!  Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Each!"
"Plankton","  So, what have you got for me today? Huh?  No Krabby Patty in sight.  What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to rebirth engineer a whole Krabby Patty!  Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier."
"Mr. Krabs","  I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying!  Stop that thief!"
"Plankton"," Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop theif! "
"Plankton"," Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free! "
"Plankton"," Ahh!  What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage!  What's going on?"
"Plankton","  Achoo!  Blasted pollen allergies!  Ahh, I should be safe in space. "
"Plankton"," You gotta be kidding me!  Hello? Hello? Open up! Open up!"
"Patrick","  Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning! "
"Plankton"," Wait, what?  Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'!  Ok you two, against the wall!  That's it. Nice and slow.  You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune."
"Plankton"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back."
"Plankton"," Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do."
"Plankton"," You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?"
"SpongeBob"," No, you need to turn yourself in."
"Plankton"," Turn myself in? What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's that?"
"Plankton"," Me, you imbecile!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Plankton"," Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Plankton"," And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!"
"SpongeBob"," Now you've gone too far!"
"Plankton"," No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe you're calling me that!"
"Plankton"," Believe it, Man Boy!"
"Patrick","  Guys, what did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you eating?"
"Patrick"," The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  Not bad."
"SpongeBob"," Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!"
"Plankton"," Ohh, he's an accomplice too!"
"Squidward","  Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep."
"Squidward"," But what do you mean 'all'? I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo."
"SpongeBob"," My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too."
"Patrick","  X-rays tickle."
"Squidward","  Hey, don't I get a phone call?"
"Squidward"," One Krabby Patty, extra grease. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! "
"Squidward"," Mmm."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob","  "
"Squidward"," GRR..."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward"," All right, let me see it.  The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?"
"SpongeBob","  What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred."
"Squidward"," Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well. "
"Squidward"," Yes?!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?"
"Squidward"," So what?"
"SpongeBob"," How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?"
"Squidward"," I hear you crying all the time."
"SpongeBob"," Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy."
"Squidward"," Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone."
"Squidward"," You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory."
"Squidward"," Really? Do you think you can?"
"SpongeBob"," No problem."
"Squidward"," Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay."
"SpongeBob"," You love music, right, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Mmm hmm."
"SpongeBob"," Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!"
"Squidward"," Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!"
"SpongeBob"," See? Your happiest memory is forming!"
"SpongeBob"," Oops. That was a sour note. "
"Squidward"," This is not my happiest memory..."
"Squidward"," Why are we at the Art Museum?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!"
"Squidward"," Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!"
"SpongeBob"," Your happiest memory?"
"Squidward"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!"
"Squidward"," And now he's melted it... Not a happiest memory..."
"SpongeBob"," Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!"
"SpongeBob"," What a majestic view!"
"Squidward"," What view?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?"
"Squidward","  Very nice... except that I'm afraid of heights!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down! "
"Squidward","  Wait! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles! "
"Squidward","  Uh oh..."
"Squidward"," Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead... "
"SpongeBob","  Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!"
"SpongeBob","  Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? Hello!?  Hello? "
"Squidward"," I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?"
"SpongeBob","  Hi Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?"
"Squidward"," Yes...  Thanks for stopping by. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!"
"Squidward","  I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," ""Tentacles"". Yes that's me."
"Squidward"," Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  Gotcha! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!? "
"SpongeBob"," Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?"
"Squidward"," You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... want... a... happiest memory! "
"SpongeBob","  So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?"
"Squidward","  I feel wonderful!  This is it, my happiest memory!"
"SpongeBob"," Sigh... he's so handsome!"
"SpongeBob"," Weee! Gotchya! There you go, little fella.  Say, Patrick. Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?"
"Patrick"," I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick. I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there."
"SpongeBob","  Aw. You're the charms. If only you didn't sting, you'd make the perfect pet!  Oh, well! I guess it's catch and release for now."
"SpongeBob","  Isn't he the cutest little jellyfish you've ever seen.  And he doesn't sting."
"SpongeBob","  You don't suppose this is some sort of new breed, huh?  I think I'll keep this one as a pet.  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward. I'm sure he doesn't want one."
"SpongeBob"," Hah, back at ya good buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Um, that's some good advice. Good night, Squidward."
"SpongeBob","  Tonight, you'll sleep with me little jelly. Goodnight, jellyfish. Goodnight, Gary! Heh, good night little jelly.  Ah, I can't sleep.  Oh, you want some popcorn? Here ya go.  Hey, hey! Are you okay?"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, look at him, the little angel. Guess he couldn't make it past the third feature.  Good morning sleepy-head. We wouldn't want anything to happen to you while I'm at work.  You better stay in here where it's safe.  You two stay out of trouble, bye!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Look at all of the customers!"
"SpongeBob","  Huh? That's funny. We just received a whole shipment of mayonnaise.  Patrick?!? What are you doing? Cooking Krabby Patties is my job."
"SpongeBob","  I saw that movie last night, too. Whoops! If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat."
"SpongeBob"," Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back."
"SpongeBob"," O...kay?  He's acting weird today.  Hey! There's plenty of mayo back here!  Huh? Is somebody in there?  Monsters! Huh? Squidward and Mr. Krabs! Patrick too!  And some random guy! Huh?  My spatula! It's just like that movie I watched last night! Those things have captured everyone and put them into creepy pods.  Hi, uh, Patrick? I gotta...clean the tables...Patrick. Ha ha...Patrick. "
"SpongeBob"," Ha ha...uh, no thanks.  Ah! Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's okay. I-I have one at home. Hah... "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Random guy!  What am I going to do? All of my friends taken by those Jelly creatures. I can feel their creepy, rope-like tentacles now! "
"Sandy"," Alright, you rotten jelly clone! What have you done with SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm no clone, Sandy! I am SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," Then you won't mind if I run a simple test.  You're SpongeBob alright..."
"SpongeBob"," What are we going to do, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," If only we knew the Jellien's weakness."
"SpongeBob"," Well the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise."
"Sandy"," Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, so you don't like mayo? Just like a Jellien!"
"Sandy","  Oh, snap out of it SpongeBob! Now if only we had some mayonnaise."
"SpongeBob"," There's lot at the Krusty Krab! But we'll never get past them! "
"Sandy"," Not to worry!  We'll be in disguise."
"Sandy"," Greetings fellow Clone. I hate mayonnaise."
"SpongeBob"," I hate mayonnaise and mustard."
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh! Sure did!"
"Sandy"," Yep. We're all rested and jelly-fied."
"SpongeBob","  Good one Jellien Sandy."
"Sandy"," "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! The mayonnaise!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy"," It worked SpongeBob! Keep going!"
"SpongeBob"," ."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! Look out!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi Jellien Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," D'oh! Almost forgot! "
"Patrick","  D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking?  Oh..."
"Sandy"," Hold it right there you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," Let 'er rip!"
"SpongeBob","  Nah! Gasp! Sandy! It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!"
"Sandy"," Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye!  Oh no! This mayonnaise is frozen solid!"
"Sandy","  Then I'll just turn up the heat! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let me tell ya!"
"SpongeBob"," And that's why we're covered in goo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks for rescuing us SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?"
"Patrick","  Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only 4 bucks extra!"
"Patrick","  Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty. Hold the mayo."
"Plankton"," You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples! "
"Plankton"," Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!"
"Plankton"," No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!"
"Plankton"," I just said they're free!"
"Plankton"," That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business."
"Plankton"," Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger. "
"Patrick"," ""Free samples"".  Yum! "
"Plankton"," It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!"
"Plankton"," Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!"
"Plankton"," That's it. "
"Plankton","  Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton."
"Plankton"," Krabby Patties, anyone?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Over here boy. "
"SpongeBob"," What is going on out there?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  ""Because the Krabby Patty is terrible"".  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine.  How about that?  I'M RUINED! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm all ears."
"SpongeBob"," We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr- "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you say it, boy."
"SpongeBob"," It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time."
"Mr. Krabs"," Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free."
"SpongeBob"," But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't remember saying anything like that."
"SpongeBob"," I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!"
"Mr. Krabs"," NO! "
"SpongeBob"," It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough, my business is doomed! "
"Plankton"," I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today! "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed."
"Squidward"," I can't feel my legs."
"SpongeBob"," Here let me help you, Squidward "
"Squidward"," I quit!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!"
"Plankton"," Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like."
"SpongeBob"," You mean, different.  That's it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room."
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!"
"SpongeBob"," All new free Krabby Patties!"
"Plankton"," Don't worry, Karen, i'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?! "
"SpongeBob"," It's working!"
"Plankton"," No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh. "
"SpongeBob"," We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, money angels, can I make one?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?"
"SpongeBob"," Hear what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good point. "
"SpongeBob","  Ahh. What could go wrong on a beautiful day like this?  Gary, time for breakfast!  The house must be settling.  Oh, that's better.  I can fix this. I'll feed you when I'm done. "
"SpongeBob","  Just a little handyman's know-how is all it takes, Gary! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Sorry, Gary. You want to eat, huh? Don't worry, I can fix both problems."
"SpongeBob","  Okay, now that that's taken care of, time to feed Gary.   Oh no! This is worse than I thought!  My door!  AHHHHHHHH!  Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!"
"Patrick"," "
"Patrick"," Put him through."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Patrick! Patrick Star!"
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy! You really need to get this place cleaned up."
"Squidward"," It's The Big One! It's the end of the world! Invest in gold! Hoard your drinking wa... I should've known.  What's going on in here?!"
"SpongeBob"," You're just in time to lend a hand, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Lend a hand? No! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, call Sandy! Tell her to get over here fast!"
"Patrick","  Say no more, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, Patrick! I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
"Patrick"," "
"Sandy"," Cheeks residence"
"Patrick"," Sandy, don't hang up!"
"Sandy"," What do you want?"
"Patrick"," Oh, nothing. I'm just hanging with the sponge. How about you?"
"Sandy"," Oh, you know. A little of this, a little of that, A little vacuuming..."
"Patrick","  Sounds like fun. I wish I was over there. SpongeBob's house is boring. There's nothing going on over here. "
"Sandy"," That sure don't sound like nothing. What's all the ruckus?"
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us... we're doomed."
"Sandy","  I'll be right over!"
"Patrick"," Oh take your time..."
"SpongeBob"," Holding steady Patrick. But, who knows how long this support system will last?"
"Squidward","  Ow"
"Sandy"," This place sure went to pot, quick. Knockity knock, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," No, Sandy don't! We must never, ever knock. This pineapple could topple over the slightest gesture. "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You were supposed to be at work two hours ago! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Your absence is costing me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I know. I'm sorry, but my hou..."
"Mr. Krabs"," And, Squidward! I expect more from you. Well, actually, no... I don't."
"Sandy"," Well, I'm with you SpongeBob. And I've got the toolbox to prove it!"
"Patrick","  I'm here because... wait a minute, why am I here? SpongeBob, I'm having another exit pencils crisis!"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. And Squidward has done a great job holding it up."
"Squidward"," Against my will, I might add."
"SpongeBob","  So what do you say Mr. Krabs? Will you help?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well... I suppose I could join the cause. But, it'll have to be our standard deal."
"SpongeBob"," A week of my wages per hour?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You got it kiddo!"
"Sandy"," Well what are we waiting for? Let's get this restoration underway! "
"Sandy","  Perfectly calibrated!  OW! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Not a bad bit of wooden starry if I do say so meself. Time to put the finishing touches on her.  Hm."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Uuummmmmm... excuse me, everyone? Not to micromanage or anything, but do any of you actually know how to build a pineapple?!"
"Sandy"," Well of course we do silly. Firstly, every pineapple needs a solid foundation to keep it firmly in place..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not exactly, Miss Cheeks. A pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly."
"Patrick"," Wrong! A pineapple needs a sweet, but tangy flavor. "
"SpongeBob"," Those are all very great ideas, but..."
"Sandy"," But, arguing ain't gonna get this pineapple fixed. Good point!  Okay, fellas! From now on, we incorporate everyone's ideas."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, that's not exactly what I had in mind, Sandy... "
"Sandy"," First thing you gotta do is clean out all this old junk."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, my furniture is perfectly fine."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heads up!  Careful, boy. I thought I'd install a grill in your TV room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I like to watch TV in my TV room."
"Sandy"," Well, this ain't the TV room, anymore. This is your indoor garden. "
"SpongeBob"," But, the sofa goes there."
"Sandy"," Oh, I know. But, isn't this better?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, do you ever feel like you are not being listened to?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, we need to talk."
"Sandy"," About these columns? Nice, huh? Gives the pineapple an intellectual flavor."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I kind of liked my pineapple the way it was. I don't need all these fancy- "
"Sandy"," Sorry, buddy. I-I can't understand you. You've got something in your mouth."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ho ho, kiddo. Look out. Just applying some plaster stucco exterior here."
"SpongeBob","  I guess what I'm trying to say is there's nothing wrong with a pineapple that looks like a pineapple."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, no, Gary! I still haven't fed you. Let's take care of that right now, little bud-"
"Patrick","  It's just not a house without a rock to sleep under."
"Sandy"," Well, what do you think, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," It's, uh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," It's, uh..."
"Sandy"," Fantastic?"
"SpongeBob"," It's, uh..."
"Patrick"," I'm hungry."
"SpongeBob"," You all worked very hard."
"Sandy"," Yee-haw!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And, since you're such a satisfied customer, I only charged you double. "
"Sandy"," Good job, fellers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good work, boy!"
"Patrick"," I'm starving. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Gary. Here it is. Our new home.  Hmmm. This must be Patrick's contribution to the living room. Hey, vintage condiment jugs! Thank you, Mr. Krabs!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!  Gary, where's the sink?!"
"SpongeBob","  Gary, I don't think that was the sink."
"SpongeBob","  Thanks for the futuristic bathroom, Sandy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, this isn't exactly home sweet pineapple, but I suppose it could be much worse. We still a roof over our heads and food on the table. Hey, that reminds me! You still haven't eaten today, have you? Sorry, buddy. You must be famished. "
"Squidward"," Ah! I'm unraveling!  If you ever, and I mean ever-  Ow! My neck. I'm gonna be in the chiropractor's for a week. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Gary. There's only one thing left to do  call and have this place condemned.  Hello, operator. City hall, please, Office of Broken Dreams."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, I'm sorry. With all this house ruckus, I completely forgot to feed you. Here you go, buddy.  ""Furnished Pineapple in a Can."" Oh, Gary! You are the best! "
"Plankton","  Almost done."
"Plankton"," What's this supposed to be?"
"Plankton"," Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry."
"Plankton"," Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you. FOOLPROOF!  Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well.  "
"Plankton"," Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife."
"Plankton"," Karen 2!"
"Plankton"," I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package."
"Plankton"," Well, I had to cut cost somewhere."
"Plankton"," Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine."
"Plankton"," Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler."
"Plankton"," And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?"
"Plankton"," Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret! "
"Plankton"," Huh, what happened?"
"Plankton"," Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard. Goodbye Karen Classic.  Hello Karen 2. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, the end of another lucrative work day SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear."
"Mr. Krabs"," Seriously son you gotta lighten up. Well good night kiddo. "
"SpongeBob"," Good night, sir.  See ya tomorrow."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet."
"SpongeBob"," Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye  Toodaloo! Whoa! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash. "
"SpongeBob"," This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system."
"Mr. Krabs","  Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?"
"SpongeBob"," Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh. He always has been a knucklehead."
"SpongeBob"," Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer?  Let's plug her in, see what she can do."
"Mr. Krabs"," She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works.  This thing does text mails right?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I think so."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that sounds promising."
"Mr. Krabs"," Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady."
"Mr. Krabs"," She's malfunctioning"
"SpongeBob"," Must be the dial-up thingy"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry "
"Mr. Krabs"," Help me out here, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back  together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean you guys were made for each other. Well you were made more for him and more specifically by him and now he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Where ya goin? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth.  Let's talk this out."
"SpongeBob"," Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what part of ""free computer"" are you not understanding?"
"Plankton"," Tonight we celebrate and tomorrow the secret formula. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well in the case, welcome aboard! "
"SpongeBob"," All right!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeehaw! "
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," My order?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly I don't have to pay her."
"Squidward"," So, I'm fired? No more taking orders?  No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob!? I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free!  Whoo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not so fast Mr. Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?"
"SpongeBob"," No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world The Krusty Krab."
"Plankton"," Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself you know."
"Plankton"," Yes I suppose that's true. All right I got this.  What's she doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Seriously? Did you just say money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?"
"Mr. Krabs"," ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?"
"Plankton"," Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula."
"Plankton"," Ow!"
"Plankton"," Take me home, baby..."
"Plankton"," Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again."
"Plankton"," I hope this works. Oh Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again."
"Plankton"," I had a reality check, that's what happened."
"Plankton"," Come on. let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey."
"Plankton"," Two of you? Heh, well that is strange."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, we could rebuild Karen 2."
"Squidward"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Keep it up, Mr Squidward. The kids love robots."
"Squidward"," Oh, well I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen.  We need another Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob","  Perfection. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't think so.  You used too much mustard!"
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," You obviously you didn't use your hydraulic mustard gauge.  You think mustard grows from seeds?  Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in  411 years!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Your skills are rusty, you're not your usual sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a neptune muffin."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm... well what about sleep, young man. Did you get enough sleep?"
"SpongeBob"," I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's it!  You're an insomniac!"
"SpongeBob"," An insomni-wha?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're a person who can't sleep and if you can't get enough sleep, your mind starts to go!  Here.  Come on, now, cook!  Ha! Ha ha! I knew it! You lifted a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?!  Now you go home and get some rest!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," No Krusty Krab?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right!  Now, get!"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come back tomorrow after a good night's sleep! "
"SpongeBob"," I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?"
"SpongeBob"," Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed."
"SpongeBob"," This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!"
"SpongeBob","  Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds!  What if I don't get to sleep at all?  Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right!  I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do?  I need some help.  Patrick, Patrick, wake up. "
"Patrick"," Uh huh.  Mmmm, spongecake. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help! Desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!"
"Patrick"," Say no more buddy, I know just the thing!  Get comfy!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! A bedtime story! "
"Patrick"," Okay. Once upon a time there was a sleepy little boy."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, yay!"
"Patrick"," The sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!"
"SpongeBob"," Mm, sounds like me."
"Patrick"," One night, he nestled into bed for a long slumber."
"SpongeBob"," Slumber!"
"Patrick"," And Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king, sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thank you Sir Cecil."
"Patrick"," He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, an exitable sea troll burst through the window. ""Wakey wakey sleepy doo!"" he bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night sky!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?"
"Patrick"," It's called The Land of Perpetual Excitement. You know, it's a ""get out of bed"" story!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep."
"Patrick"," Oh.  Right. Oh I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! ""Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Patrick, that's..."
"Patrick"," Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, be active! Get up, be active!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this isn't..."
"Patrick"," Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!"
"SpongeBob"," That's a catchy bit..."
"Patrick"," Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!"
"SpongeBob"," That's an excellent number, but..."
"Patrick"," Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! This isn't helping either!"
"Patrick"," Well, what-what abou- well, I don't know what you want from me. It's not like I have a magic wand to wave.  Or do I..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, barnacles."
"Patrick"," Hocus, pocus!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, get serious please!"
"Patrick"," Abra zeptabra!"
"SpongeBob"," I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles."
"SpongeBob"," Blech!"
"Patrick"," And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up."
"SpongeBob"," Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-"
"Patrick"," Drink it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, That wasn't too bad. What was it?"
"Patrick"," Coffee."
"SpongeBob"," C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep!"
"Patrick"," Oops.."
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding...  Uh oh.  N-no! No stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Mr. warm milk, you just tasted so good.  Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you."
"Patrick"," Spongecake!"
"SpongeBob"," What's this? Another vision?  Oh why, why? Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!"
"SpongeBob"," Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king!?"
"SpongeBob"," Hm.. it's getting all sleepish around here.  Oh, thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some shut-eye. Now to prepare for work.  Perfect.  Bye, Gary. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boyo...? "
"SpongeBob"," Hu-ee?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Y-Yes... SpongeBob reporting for sleepy and tired."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ew! You're stinking like Davy Jones' locker! You sure you didn't forget something, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Forget..? Oh, right, right, Mr. Krabs. How could I be so forgetful?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, that's my boy.  What the barnacles?!"
"SpongeBob"," Employees must wash their hands before cooking.  Oh, that's nice..."
"Mr. Krabs"," That ain't the sink, kiddo! "
"SpongeBob"," I know I know, I just need a quiet place... to nap."
"Mr. Krabs"," Me mustard!  You didn't heed my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Mr. Krabs! I tried, I really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now he's crying away me mustard. That's enough boy! Me profits!  Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, you're a natural born mustard dispenser!"
"SpongeBob"," Is that a good thing? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Dow, uh, nuh, Oh no, no boy. It's- It's terrible."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just terrible!"
"Squidward"," Best day at work ever!"
"Patrick"," Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way. I could've spent my lunch drink.  Ahh."
"Patrick"," That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out. "
"SpongeBob","  I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! "
"Patrick"," Oh, hey, how about this? "
"SpongeBob"," That's awesome! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I here are making faces at each other."
"Patrick"," Funny faces make me laugh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?"
"SpongeBob"," Why, is there something wrong?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Haven't ye ever heard the saying ""If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me tell you the story of face freeze.  It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Permanently!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good. I hope you've learned your lesson."
"SpongeBob"," I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again."
"Patrick"," Done and done."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face."
"Patrick"," Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all."
"SpongeBob"," No faces... at all. Yeah. This is...  easy. How you holding up?"
"Patrick"," Huh, fine. You?"
"Patrick","  Dun ah eeh."
"SpongeBob"," Hey!  Patrick.  Patrick!!!"
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze."
"Patrick"," Gosh, you're right."
"SpongeBob"," Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true. Let's make lots of faces."
"Patrick"," You mean like this?  Ree eeh eeh!"
"Patrick","  Aye yi yi yi!"
"SpongeBob","  Aw!"
"Patrick"," Phee!"
"SpongeBob"," Ay yi yi yi yi yi!"
"Patrick"," Dun ree ah yee!"
"SpongeBob"," Doy doy doy doy!"
"Patrick"," Ah ah ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Duh!"
"Patrick"," Aydh!"
"SpongeBob"," Awoot duh doo!"
"Patrick"," Looo ooo ooo!"
"SpongeBob"," Day ah dah da dah!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't breathe! Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time."
"Patrick"," Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross,  uh? And then slip into and overbite.  And the finishing touch. Gah lowh."
"SpongeBob","  Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one...  The Gary. Meow!"
"Patrick","  Gloriously disgusting, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share then with the whole wide sea. "
"Sandy"," You two need help. "
"Patrick"," Hey Spongebob! "
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob! "
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," It never gets so old! "
"Squidward"," Would You Mind?! "
"SpongeBob"," Mind What? Making Faces? Of course were don't."
"SpongeBob"," Your Turn Squidward let's see your Crazy Face."
"Squidward"," I don't wanna make faces I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That's a good one right there."
"Squidward"," Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!"
"SpongeBob"," Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!"
"Patrick"," Oh yeah? Watch me."
"Squidward"," Whatever works."
"SpongeBob","  Wow Patrick, you did hold that face all night!"
"Patrick"," Actually, I can't move my face at all "
"SpongeBob"," I can't move my face either!"
"Patrick"," All right! We did it!"
"SpongeBob","  No Patrick, It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! Patrick we have a Face Freeze!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!"
"Sandy"," Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage."
"SpongeBob"," And you're a licensed masseuse, right Sandy?"
"Sandy"," Well I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. "
"Sandy"," You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. Fell them nights just meltin away. Let's see if i can just get that jaw line back in place.  Phew! OK you two bad news first. That wicked Face Freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahoy, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, you all right boy, eh, look a little killy-wompish walking in here."
"SpongeBob"," Doing fine Mr. Krabs. Just grillin and grillin."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahem. But what's with this cubed posture"
"SpongeBob"," You hear that, someone just dropped a penny."
"Mr. Krabs","  Where?! Where?! "
"SpongeBob"," That'll buy me some time."
"Squidward"," Let's go SpongeBob, the orders are pouring out."
"SpongeBob"," On it, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Onion juice! Ah!"
"Squidward"," Come on SpongeBob! Chop, chop!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay."
"SpongeBob","  Phew. Order up."
"Squidward"," You deliver it, I'm on break."
"Mr. Krabs"," Penny, penny, penny, penny."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs is still distracted, now's my chance. Your order is served, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, dear."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, come back!"
"SpongeBob"," Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?"
"SpongeBob"," How should I know, I'm just the cook in these parts."
"Mr. Krabs"," Face me when I'm talking to you, boy.  So I can see your face."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs?  My impersonation of a burrito!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh? "
"Patrick"," Oh. Uh, is this a bad time, SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I see what's going on here.  Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, we thought it was one of your stories."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm losing business, because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah!  No! I can't move my face. I've got face freeze too!"
"Squidward"," What is the hold up in here?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait Squidward, don't get worked up you could get the face freeze!"
"Squidward"," Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too!  This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh.  Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Look! Squidward has it too!"
"Squidward"," Hey, it's not funny! Stop laughing!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Guests! May I offer you some lemonade?"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, did you just say Glove World!?"
"SpongeBob"," Close Glove World!? Has the world gone mad?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry I gotta go. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Patrick"," I can't come out. SpongeBob I'm taking a shower."
"SpongeBob"," But Patrick, it's Glove World!! They're gonna... "
"Patrick"," Glove World!? "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick wait! "
"SpongeBob"," There it is Patrick. Glove World!."
"Patrick"," Look at that guy, he must be the owner."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World! forever."
"Patrick"," Close Glove World!?! Has the world gone mad?! "
"Patrick"," Uh, it feels good."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, that looks Glovey on you Patrick."
"Patrick"," It fits like a glove."
"SpongeBob"," Glove size fits all."
"Patrick"," A penny saved is a penny gloved!"
"SpongeBob"," You can leave a glove to glove, but you can't make it glove."
"Patrick"," She gloves me, she gloves me not."
"SpongeBob"," All's fair in glove and war."
"Patrick"," Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove."
"SpongeBob"," Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World!. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time."
"Patrick"," For all time's right sake."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there she is Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl. "
"Patrick"," Goodbye Tilt-A-Hurl. "
"Patrick"," We'll miss you. "
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye Glove Drop."
"Patrick"," So many fun memories on this ride."
"SpongeBob"," I know Patrick but we have to be brave.  Where to next Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I think you know where pal. "
"SpongeBob"," The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in entire glove kingdom. This is the last time we'll ever ride it."
"Patrick"," Come on buddy. Let's take our seats. "
"SpongeBob"," I just don't get it, I mean why? Why must Glove World! close? "
"Patrick"," Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel. "
"SpongeBob"," Ew, did you hear that?"
"Patrick"," Excuse me."
"SpongeBob"," No not that it was... oh no Patrick look!"
"Patrick"," Oh no! What am I looking at?"
"SpongeBob"," The Ferris Wheel. It's free of it mornings! "
"Patrick"," Then you mean..."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Patrick"," It's free from it's mornings!  SpongeBob what are you doing? We must remain seated in all times!"
"SpongeBob"," We have to jump off this thing before it crashes! Come on! "
"Patrick"," Wh-wh-wh-wh? You know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!"
"Patrick"," I uh, oh if you say so. "
"SpongeBob"," Nice job Patrick."
"Patrick"," Thanks!"
"SpongeBob"," Look!  Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake."
"Patrick"," That's really gonna spoil the residents of Glove Castle."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality."
"Patrick"," We've come this far why start now?"
"SpongeBob"," All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World! is closing. I mean just look around you, open your eyes."
"Patrick"," Ok. "
"SpongeBob"," See what I mean Patrick. Glove world! is on it's last legs."
"Patrick"," Yeah, or on it's last finger."
"SpongeBob"," I just wish there was something we can do. "
"Patrick"," I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World! and cheers us up."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second.  That's it!"
"Patrick"," It is?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course, we just have to fix Glove World!."
"Patrick"," We do?"
"SpongeBob"," Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World! open. Are you with me?"
"Patrick"," I think so. Yeah, I'm here. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay Patrick, this is it you remember what to say?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved..."
"SpongeBob","  Hall of mirrors."
"Patrick"," Hall of Mirrors!"
"SpongeBob"," It's working."
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Patrick"," Mr.Owner Mr.Owner! Can I wear the glovey glove costume? Please, please? I just wanna try it on. And also this hat you let me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See? "
"Patrick"," Thanks! "
"Patrick"," Oh oh! Glove Ice cream!  Thanks! "
"Patrick"," I thought he gave it to me. "
"SpongeBob"," Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. Bet something I can fix. "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me.  Much better.  Ooh. "
"Patrick"," Come back here!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Stop! What are you doing?"
"Patrick"," I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer."
"SpongeBob"," Listen Patrick, did you hear that?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's the sound of total silence.  Plus tumbleweeds."
"SpongeBob"," Everybody's gone home Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World!, and now it's over. They're gonna close it, there's nothing we can do."
"Patrick"," Well, there is one thing we can do. "
"SpongeBob"," We're doing what any concern responsible person does when they're left no other choice."
"Patrick"," Yeah brother! We're chaining ourselves, through a gate."
"SpongeBob"," Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready Patrick?!"
"Patrick"," You bet!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key."
"Patrick"," What key?"
"SpongeBob"," The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains."
"Patrick"," Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah, you told me to keep in the safe place remember?"
"SpongeBob"," So where you keeping it?"
"Patrick"," At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will eeeeeeeeeveeerr find it!  SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," My, what a beautiful day it is outside.  Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Who are you talking to Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Just where I always seem to be on a nice sunny day."
"SpongeBob"," Look at it this way Squidward Things could always be worse."
"Squidward"," Worse? How?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, uh..."
"SpongeBob"," Uh...you could be sick."
"Squidward"," Sick? Is that really a ""worse""?"
"SpongeBob","  Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. That's not even the worst part."
"Squidward"," Oh, really."
"SpongeBob"," No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward. Squidward. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well. "
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter?"
"Squidward"," Uh, well. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh,  dry mouth, and my, uh, eyes are itchy. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what could it be?"
"Squidward"," I'm not sure. But I feel I might be coming down with a dreaded illness."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?"
"Squidward"," Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, square, uh, squid's disease."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Squid's disease."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Squid's disease!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob.  What are you doing back there?"
"SpongeBob"," I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for someone in your condition would be to  go home and not come back until you're fully recovered."
"Squidward"," Well, SpongeBob. I think you're probably right."
"SpongeBob","  I'm so sorry, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're sick?!"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do. You know what. I'm better give you the old navy whatsoever just to be sure."
"Squidward"," The what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now open wide."
"Mr. Krabs","  Tongue looks fine.  Eyes, check. "
"Squidward"," Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Forehead feels normal.  Now let's see those kneecaps.  Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you."
"Squidward"," Wonderful."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle."
"Squidward"," But Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Krabs nothing."
"Squidward"," But I..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Krabs nothing!"
"Squidward"," But..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it."
"Squidward"," But the customers. You don't want them to get sick, do you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No. And I don't want them to get hungry either.  Now step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon. "
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, please."
"SpongeBob"," Right away, Squidward."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob.  Turn around, please."
"SpongeBob","  Yes."
"Squidward"," And just what is that supposed to be?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh this. It's a number 2 Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink..."
"Squidward"," Not that. The thing on your face."
"SpongeBob","  Oh this."
"Squidward"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias."
"Squidward","  Hiiii, SpoooongeBooooob."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Could I see that?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, actually no."
"Squidward"," Because I find this all so very inte...  ...resting."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!"
"SpongeBob","  Mis...ter...Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's better. Now what can I do you for?"
"SpongeBob"," It's Squidward. He's sick."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that."
"SpongeBob"," Who was the first?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marbleway Mountain. That doesn't sound like a bad gig actually."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, got a minute?"
"Squidward"," Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything."
"Mr. Krabs","  We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked."
"Mr. Krabs"," He can't cook in this condition. No cooking, no patties. No patties, no money."
"Squidward"," And you're telling me this, why?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I need you to make yourself scarce for a while."
"Squidward"," So, you're telling me to go home?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!"
"Squidward"," Yippee! Thank you, Mr. Krabs! I mean "
"SpongeBob"," Poor Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  That's funny. My eyes feel itchy.  And my throat feels scratchy, too.  Itchy eyes, scratchy throat...  even my mouth feels dry!  I've contracted... Squid's Disease! "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, everything all right in here?"
"SpongeBob"," Everything's fine, captain. Just a little howl for pleasure."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well how about a little less pleasure and a little more work. "
"SpongeBob","  If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here.  Grandma always said If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.  Or was it cold water?  Something tells me it wwwasssnn't thhaat either. Of course. It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil.  Uh huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities.  Oh no!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, everything's fine in here.  Just dandy.  I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious.  This super hot spicy yellow mustard should do the trick. No, actually that burns real bad.  Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some—  pickles! Pickles, they're like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come.  Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!"
"SpongeBob"," But who's going to run the restaurant?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya."
"Squidward","  Who thought that having an illness could feel so good? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Oh, no. What happened to you?"
"SpongeBob"," I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right Squidward?  Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy  some afternoon tea."
"SpongeBob"," That seems like a great idea, Squidward."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?"
"SpongeBob"," I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to funny, but they always make me cry."
"Mr. Krabs"," 25 Krabby Patties!  Order up! Order up!"
"SpongeBob","  Wasn't that great, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Oh yeah howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next."
"Squidward"," Oh would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, Squidward wait. Squidward, you're not well enough to return to work. I can't let you."
"Squidward"," Please just stop. Stop following me."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease."
"SpongeBob"," Squid's Disease? I know just the cure! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Romantic Comedy, The Movie? No!  Ah! Get that thing away from me!"
"Squidward","  Let the madness begin."
"SpongeBob"," It's  driving test day!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Thanks?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it.  What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. It's a good thing too. One more crash and you would've popped for sure. Here, let me take that wheel."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mrs. Puff. How are you feeling?"
"SpongeBob"," Hm, from now on, I guess we'll have to call you Mrs. Pop! "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff! What are you doing!?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry! Stop, Mrs. Puff!  That tickles!"
"SpongeBob"," Sheesh! I don't know what she is so upset about!  I think she looks better this way! If I always say, it's duh doy.."
"SpongeBob","  Hello, Mrs. Puff. Are we feeling any better?"
"SpongeBob"," I see you got the flowers I sent"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, this room is so dark and depressing!  You need sunlight! ."
"SpongeBob","  Come on, Mrs. Puff! You need to get out of this stuffy, old room!"
"SpongeBob"," Up and at 'em!  Y'know what will make you feel better, Mrs. Puff? A nice peaceful stroll! ."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me! Doctor! What's up with those guys?"
"SpongeBob"," What's so funny?"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," Look out, extra credit! Here I come!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah! ."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Oh, dear. I think I'm in that fellow's way.  Engage turn signals. Adjust mirrors. Hands at ten and two, and finally floor it. ."
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff! What should I..."
"SpongeBob"," Put her in drive? Thanks, Mrs. Puff, you're the best!"
"SpongeBob","  What's that Mrs. Puff? ."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff! It's you!  And you're all ""puffy"" again! Now everything's back to normal!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward! What'cha watchin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh."
"Squidward"," Here, I'll change the channel."
"SpongeBob"," Don't change the channel!"
"SpongeBob"," Did you see that, Squidward?  Snail Bites."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, I'm home!  Oh, Gary! You've got a big surprise coming to you."
"SpongeBob"," Snail Bites. "
"SpongeBob"," It smells good? "
"SpongeBob"," Does somebody want another Snail Bite?  Can somebody roll over?  Roll over."
"SpongeBob"," We'll have some more of these a little later. "
"SpongeBob"," More treats?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I can't say no to my wittle Gare-Bear. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, that's an awful lot of Snail Bites for one evening. Are you sure you want more?  Well, I suppose one more couldn't hurt.  Whoops, looks like that was the last of them Gary. We're all out.  It's probably for the best.  I'm getting pretty tired anyway. I think I'll skip my nightly motivational exercise and go to straight to bed."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, please! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary Wilson, Junior, I promise you we will get more treats tomorrow! Now, please, let me  sleep. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary! It is 400 in the morning! What exactly do you want from me?! "
"SpongeBob","  Gary, this is ridiculous! See? The pet store won't be open for hours.  Not to mention it's freezing out here! Can't we just go home and come back in the morning?"
"SpongeBob"," I just can't say no to my little Gare-Bear.  Good night, Gary.  See ya in the morning!  "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you have any Snail Bites? We need some Snail Bites."
"SpongeBob","  Ok, Gary, I'm off to the Krusty Krab!  Hope your day is as fun-filled as mine! Whoa! Gary?!  Yes, so, I will see you tonight, Gary.  Gary, is that a box of Snail Bites in your teeth? He, he. That's funny, because I think I just saw a half-full box in the kitchen.   "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, what are you doing here? You're causing a scene! "
"SpongeBob"," I know, you want more Snail Bites. But the pet store was completely sold out of them!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, Gary..."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, I just said the pet store was completely sold out of Snail Bites! What am I supposed to do?"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks a lot.  You're what!"
"SpongeBob"," You see, Gary? There are no more..."
"SpongeBob"," So, you see, Gary, there..."
"SpongeBob"," Would you mind being quiet for one second, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, they're completely sold out. There are no more Snail Bites left in the entire world and there never will be!"
"SpongeBob","  What do you want me to do, Gary?  Travel the Earth, checking ever pet store in existence to see if they happen to have a box of Snail Bites left? Is that what you want?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, take a look at this map.  This is a map of every pet store in the entire world! We've been to every single one of them, Gary! And not one of them has the treats you are after! Not one! I can't keep looking, Gary. I just can't."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! Your snail's still meowing? I have experience with these situations. You're the sponge. He is the snail. You just have to say ""no"" in a very firm voice!"
"SpongeBob"," But I don't want to say no to my wittle Gare-Bear! I want him to be happy!"
"Patrick"," Well, you gotta be firm, SpongeBob! Sometimes, you have to no when to say know. Oh, wait, wait, wait, it's the other way around. You have to know when to say ""no"". Yeah, that's it!"
"SpongeBob"," But I don't know how to say no, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," No problem, SpongeBob! You can practice on me! Pretend I'm Gary and tell me ""no""."
"SpongeBob","  I can't! You're so cute!"
"Patrick","  Do it, SpongeBob!   Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick"," Stop it! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, this won't be easy, but the time has come when I must say nee, nn... Oh, Gary, It's a photo, it's a framed photo of the moment I picked you up at the pound.  I remember that day like it was yesterday. Oh, and a photo of the time you built me a castle made of glitter and lollipops.  Gary, this is the most special... Oh. Nice try, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Gare-Bear, we looked everywhere! There are no more Snail Bites! I'm sorry, Gary, but the answer is... no. "
"Patrick"," This last known box of Snail Bites sure is delicious!  Hey! It's empty! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Atten--  Attention, Krusty Krab  patrons. Behold!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Today only, the Krusty Krab presents our first annual bun seed guessing contest.  Guess how many seeds are in the jar and win a f-- f-- sorry, a f-- f-- I'll try again. A f-- f--  free Krabby Patty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Step right up.  Guess right and win.  They'll never guess it."
"Mr. Krabs"," No. Next, please."
"Mr. Krabs","  Nope."
"Mr. Krabs"," N-n-no."
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"Mr. Krabs","  That's not even a number."
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton, you  don't get to guess."
"Plankton"," Hey.  What? You can't do that. It's not fair."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please. Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formula."
"Plankton"," You'll pay for this, Krabs. I'm calling the Bogus Business Bureau."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, right. Like they would even take your call."
"Plankton"," Hello, yes. I have a complaint."
"Mr. Krabs"," That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, uh, no. He's out of town."
"SpongeBob"," Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs.  He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," New trainee."
"Plankton"," And I'm both of those things. You have to let me guess now,  Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm won't do it.  And you can't make me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, fine."
"Plankton"," This round goes to Plankton."
"SpongeBob"," Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance."
"Plankton"," Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, he's getting close."
"Plankton"," ...And one."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none. You are one over the mark. You lose."
"Plankton"," Yeah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," 500298, 500299, 500300.  I win."
"Plankton"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs. Plankton was right."
"Plankton"," Yes!"
"Plankton"," You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't."
"Plankton"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first."
"SpongeBob"," I cleaned it this morning."
"Mr. Krabs"," Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope, she's perfectly aligned."
"Mr. Krabs"," Drat your efficiency. Uh, oh, yeah.  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show."
"Plankton"," What show?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty.  See?"
"Plankton"," Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?"
"Plankton"," Drat."
"Plankton"," Is this part of  ""the show?"""
"Mr. Krabs"," No, this is isn't part of the show."
"Plankton"," Ugh."
"SpongeBob"," Puppets!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie."
"Mr. Krabs"," He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  Pl-- Flankton."
"SpongeBob"," Boo! Hiss!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face."
"Plankton"," Okay, we get it already."
"Mr. Krabs"," Unfortunately for Flankton,  the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventually he popped.  The end."
"Plankton","  Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make it a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook."
"SpongeBob"," I'll do my best, sir."
"Mr. Krabs","  Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy."
"Squidward"," Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. It's a death trap."
"Mr. Krabs"," There we go.  Ooh, that takes care of that.  And in three, two, one."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob.  "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, it's awful. We're all out of buns."
"Mr. Krabs"," No buns? Drat the luck."
"SpongeBob"," Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd."
"Plankton"," Finally. At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine. Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go."
"SpongeBob"," One Krabby Patty to go.   Here you are."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, you don't.  You have to eat it on the premises.  Them's the rules. "
"Plankton"," Yeah, that's what it says."
"Mr. Krabs"," So."
"Plankton"," Okay, okay. I will.  I bid you good day, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," You gotta swallow it here on the premises."
"Plankton"," Oh, come on."
"Plankton"," Fine.  Can I go now?"
"Plankton"," Karen, quick. You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat."
"Plankton"," There's no time. I can feel it digesting."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," What is it, lad?"
"SpongeBob"," Take a look."
"Plankton"," Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene, want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket."
"Plankton"," Wait, come back. Oh, come on, Karen. What happened?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It warms my heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over.  Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah  and put these seeds back on 'em."
"SpongeBob"," That's my Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Oh, it's drawing very near. My favorite time of the year.  The snow is falling and the cold wind blows.  Christmas is almost here.  And I know that Santa, Santa.

"Plankton"," I'm way ahead of you, Karen!  There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold!  Jerktonium!  I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all goodies. The fruitcake! Each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium!

"SpongeBob"," Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem."
"Sandy"," Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!"
"Sandy"," Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyser!  Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake!  This is terrible!"
"SpongeBob"," What is it, Sandy?"
"Sandy"," The fruitcake is contaminated with jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," From Plankton, he baked it."
"Sandy"," You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Sandy"," You're an idiot."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Sandy"," No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!"
"Sandy","  Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason it's not affecting you.  It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula.  Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!"

"Plankton"," Well, I'd like to take you up on your offer to make the Chum Bucket a success!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I don't know about that."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't value you at all! "
"Squidward"," I'll do it. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't you think that working at the Chum Bucket AND the Krusty Krab is a conflict of interest, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Geez SpongeBob, I hadn't thought of that! You're right! I quit.  Eh, a bit industrial, but I can make it work.  You call this a kitchen? We should start by tearing out this wall so the chef is visible to his adoring fans!"
"Squidward"," I don't see any use for all these old flap traps. We should just break them down for parts. "
"Plankton"," But, but that's my chum-fueled antennae massager!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry! Remind me, who's in complete creative control here?"
"Plankton"," Anyone can come in and redecorate, pal, but you still haven't proven how you're gonna make chum edible!"
"Squidward"," So I guess the proof is in the pudding, then, isn't it?"
"Plankton"," You're making chum pudding?"
"Squidward"," I'm making chum fricassee. "
"Plankton"," Frica-what?"
"Squidward"," See, Plankton, there's a trick to making chum edible.  We just have to follow old Grandma Tentacles's secret fricassee recipe."
"Plankton"," Secret recipe, you say, huh?  What's in it?"
"Squidward"," Nice try, tiny Cyclops. You won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily, but preparation cannot be rushed. Each batch must simmer for exactly 24 hours."
"Plankton"," Who took my blue blanky? Huh? This is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising."
"Squidward"," Oh, just taste it already!"
"Plankton","  Well, the smell doesn't make me wretch...  Hey, that ain't bad at all!  It's actually amazing!  This is gold in the form of chum! Squidward, my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star."
"Squidward"," A star."
"Plankton"," A star."
"Plankton"," Ha-ha-ha! That's right, Krabs! Now, we have a secret formula, and it's in a bottle, and you can't have it! Ha-ha!"
"Squidward"," Give that back, please!  Thank you!"
"Plankton"," Secret!!!!"
"Squidward"," Anything for my fans."
"Mr. Krabs"," This is mutiny! And the public is actually eating it! Well, at least our loyal clientele haven't jumped on the chum wagon."
"SpongeBob"," Don't speak too soon, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sooo, we're having a slow day. At least Old Jethra has stuck with us. That Krabby Patty hitting the spot, Jethra?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Time to get to the bottom of this.  Oohh, just act like your another fancy customer."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Shh!  What's gotten into you? High-faluting customers don't bark at the top of their lungs like a seadog."
"SpongeBob"," Oops, uh... I mean, I fancy a bit of the old chum. Indeed I do, Squire."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good evening, Madam. Table for two, please?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I be Eugene Krab....er....I mean, uh,  Sir Krumple O'Wrapper. Uh, that's my name. Don't wear it out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Reservation? In this sinkhole?!"
"Squidward"," What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well,  if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you.  Bon Appetit, Suckers!  See you in two years! "
"Plankton"," Yeah, see how you like it, Krabs! "
"Squidward"," One at a time, please."
"Squidward"," Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!"
"Plankton","  Yeah, what's up?"
"Squidward"," Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!"
"Plankton"," What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours. "
"Squidward"," I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!"
"Plankton"," But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty. "
"Plankton"," Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, this is great!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Better than a Krabby Patty?"
"SpongeBob"," A what?"
"Mr. Krabs","  This is delicious! No!!!!!! I'm ruined! "
"Squidward","  Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world famous Fricassee.  Grandma!"
"Squidward"," What are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him! "
"Plankton"," What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!"
"Squidward"," Ok, I admit it! I admit it! But—but what's the big deal?  Ow!"
"Plankton"," Not the napkins!!! "
"Plankton"," My restaurant! "
"Squidward"," My fan base! "
"Squidward"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob","  Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all."
"Mr. Krabs"," I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!"
"Squidward"," No!  Living the dream! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Gotcha! Whoa! You're a big one! Can't believe I've never seen you in the Krusty Krab before!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Hey, Squidward? Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I haven't seen Mr. Krabs all morning. Do you know where he is?"
"Squidward"," Don't know, don't care."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, there you are, Mr. Krabs! Where have you been?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've been conducting a little research! Where's Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Present!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You two! Follow me!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wow! You've been busy, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," I want you to take a look at these folks right here. Have you ever seen any of them in the Krusty Krab? Think hard?"
"SpongeBob"," Uuuummmmm, hmm. Um, no, no, no, possibly, no, maybe, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no! No, sir, I do not recognize any of them, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," How about you, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I try not to look directly at the customers."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab. That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket. And when I see that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!"
"SpongeBob"," When I see that 2%, I think of pie!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not talking about pie!  These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant! We need to find that 2% and reel them in. So I want you two to promote the Krusty Krab!"
"Squidward"," Will we get overtime pay?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Over-what who?"
"Squidward","  Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs! I'll get right on that, never."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! I'll promote the Krusty Krab and I know just where to start!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Bottomites!  Hello, sir! Have you ever heard of the most wonderful restaurant in all of Bikini Bottom, the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," Please accept one of our fliers and consider dining at our fine eating establishment the next time you're feeling hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, sir! Tell all your... friends. Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!"
"Patrick"," Oh, no! I knew this day would come! Invasion of the Giant Patties! There's only one thing to do! It's eat or be eaten!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! What are you doing? It's me, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," Oh, no! The giant patty has eaten my buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Relax, Patrick! It's me! This is just a cost.."
"Patrick"," Cough him up, you monster! Come here, you!  Die, giant patty, die! Patties should not eat my buddy! "
"Plankton"," Boy, I don't know what it is, but I feel like there's something in the air! Today is the day I finally get a Krabby Patty! "
"Patrick"," You okay, little buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I guess... so."
"Patrick"," What's this? "
"SpongeBob"," It's a flyer... to promote the Krusty Krab! Cause Mr. Krabs needs all the money!"
"Patrick"," Well, this will never do! You gotta think bigger! Everyone should know about the... uh... Krusty Krab. We need an ad blitz of monumental proportions! Everywhere you look, you should see the name... the Krabby Klam."
"SpongeBob"," Krusty Krab."
"Patrick"," Whatever!"
"SpongeBob","  That tickles!"
"Patrick"," Hold still! I'm almost through! Perfect!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't forget about the paint!"
"Patrick"," Hold on to your shorts! I got it! "
"SpongeBob","  It's cold!"
"Patrick"," Ok, now turn around! Open wide!  Wider!  Perfect!  Ready?"
"SpongeBob","  Ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, what are we doing here?"
"Patrick"," I hired a skywriter! Oh, there he is now!"
"Patrick"," Somehow, I thought that would be more effective."
"SpongeBob"," We left you a present in there! "
"Patrick"," Hey, I can see my house from here! "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Aaaaaaaahhhh!"
"Patrick"," Ooh, the Krusty Krab! "
"SpongeBob"," Phew!"
"Patrick"," Huh! Oh, it's SpongeBob!  Hey, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," I think the ad campaign is going really well."
"Patrick"," I agree! "
"SpongeBob"," Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know what you're doing, boy-o, but it's working like cake busters. This place is as packed as the trills-with-gills. In fact, I'm seeing some of the same holdouts I saw this morning "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I better get back to help with the crowd!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, don't worry about that, boy! Squidward's holdin' down the fort!  You just keep doing what you're doing and bring in that last 1%! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but how do we find that last 1%?"
"Patrick"," Well, there's one place we missed. That big pile of roads! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, uh, Patrick?  We're not supposed to play in traffic."
"Patrick"," Well, we're not playing! We're working!"
"SpongeBob"," But what if we get hit by a boat?"
"SpongeBob"," Tartar sauce!"
"Patrick","  I got this! "
"Patrick"," Your canvas awaits! "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Patrick!  That should do it! Let's go back to the Krusty Krab and greet that last 1%! "
"SpongeBob"," Here they come!  Let's go inside! We did it, Mr. Krabs! Soon, you'll have more customers than you'll know what to do with!"
"Squidward"," It's about time! Where have you been? I'm outta here! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! This is a dream come true! SpongeBob, get back behind the grill, and Patrick, buy something or get out!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! Here they come!  But they're not happy! We'll be bombarded! Patrick, help me hold the door shut!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's him! Let him in! It's the last 1%.  Gotcha! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That'll be 50 bucks!  This advertising campaign has really paid off! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?"
"Plankton","  This looks suspicious."
"Plankton","  99 feet!"
"Mr. Krabs","  It's true."
"Plankton","  Ah!  Oof!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm not going anywhere!. You're the one who is moving!"
"Plankton","  You are moving!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohoho! No, you are!"
"Plankton"," Oh, no I'm not!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Pack your bags pipsqueak!"
"Plankton","  You might as well close up shop right now, Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing."
"Mr. Krabs","  At least I have customers."
"Plankton","  Oh yeah!? Well I'm gonna put together a... uh... a petition of customer signatures."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Good luck with that ludicrous idea! .  Petition?  Squidward! SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!"
"SpongeBob","  Sir, yes, sir!"
"Squidward","  Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna do this."
"SpongeBob","  And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support?  Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!"
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?"
"SpongeBob"," Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab? "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this. "
"SpongeBob","  Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob","  Sir, where did you get this?"
"SpongeBob"," This must be Plankton's dirty plan.  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-"
"SpongeBob","  Delicious!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Thanks for saving me shell, boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty."
"Plankton","  That does it!"
"Plankton","  My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes.  Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we?  So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe. "
"SpongeBob","  Plankton, I'm sorry.  Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious. "
"Plankton","  Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here."
"SpongeBob"," But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be low enough to do that?"
"Plankton","  Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Plankton"," Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day."
"SpongeBob","  Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... money?! "
"Plankton"," You just got a steal, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number.  I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago.  Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!"
"Plankton"," How much you got?"
"Plankton"," All right. My wife's not for sale.  But everything else must go!  Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase.   Who wants free money? "
"Plankton","  Okay, okay. One at a time, please.  To receive your free money,  just sign this petition to save the Chum Bucket."
"Mr. Krabs","  This is outrageous!  You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom.  There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing.  But how can I compete with free money?  I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good. "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!"
"Squidward","  Whoo... priceless."
"Plankton","   Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need!  I got the signatures!  All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon.  But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need."
"Mr. Krabs","  It's time. "
"Plankton","  Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But... but...   No! I'm not going anywhere!"
"Mr. Krabs"," If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant,  it's gonna be long and painful!"
"SpongeBob","   Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward?  Squidward?"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!"
"Plankton","  Bring it on! Bring the destruction! "
"Mr. Krabs","   Goodbye, Krusty Krab!   Eh?"
"Plankton","  What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh...  you forgot to level the place!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Uhh... yeah."
"Plankton","  But that's not fair! "
"SpongeBob"," So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?"
"SpongeBob","  Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, dear. "
"Plankton","   Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction!  I think I've seen enough. "
"Squidward","  Maybe I'll...practice my clarinet."
"Squidward"," Ah-he-he-hem. "
"SpongeBob"," Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ...would want."
"SpongeBob"," Hi neighbor!"
"Squidward"," Gah! Dah! Dah! Dah!"
"SpongeBob"," Should we take it from the top?"
"Squidward"," The day I willingly practice my musical art with you is the day I grow hair on my..."
"Squidward"," And who might you be?"
"Squidward"," ♪Are you serious? Is this a dream?♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Did someone said money? I could swear that's what I heard! I got super sensitive hearing when it comes to that word!"
"Squidward"," ♪Yes he said money, but more importantly he said faaaannnnnnssss! And not the type that blows air if you're feeling too hot! The type that wants autographs on everything they got!♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪And when I heard the word ""Team"" which is special to meeee! 'Cause through the power of music there's no way we won't get. The bond together with this special duet!♪"
"Squidward"," Uh, excuse me? Is there anyway I get to do this tour as a soloist?"
"Squidward"," ♪A dream wrapped in pain. I don't know whether to smile or pout.♪"

"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Thanks for all the great tips! I think you should be on your way! Good bye! Good luck! Have a nice day! Sooo! What are we waiting for? It's high tide time we went on tour!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Up and at 'em boys! We got a tour to put on!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mornin' Squidward!  Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find..."
"Patrick","  Somebody left this thing laying around the parking lot."
"Mr. Krabs"," Roadie! Check!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here we are boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!"
"Squidward"," Sounds like a load of hooey..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright roadie, start unloading the hooey! "
"Patrick","  Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Anywhere is fine."
"Patrick"," Then what about this? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Look! It's Ned and the Needlefish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well that's very interesting Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahhhh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Deal!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top!  Doggonit..."
"SpongeBob"," It sure was nice of that Colonel Carper guy to let us borrow his entire wall of sound equipment! Wasn't it Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, here we are! Our next gig! "
"Squidward"," We're performing at a supermarket!? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry Squidward but that is physically impossible!"
"Squidward"," What!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because it's not there anymore!"
"SpongeBob"," The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!"
"SpongeBob","  You did what!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by."
"Plankton","  Gasp!  Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!"
"Squidward"," It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!"
"Squidward"," A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four!  Thank you! Thank you very much!  Oh come on! Nothing!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What a happy celebration!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you Mr......Supermarker Manager."
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this? Our pay check?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What!?"
"Squidward"," You're kidding me, right!? We're performing at a retirement home!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh don't worry Squidward! These geezers really know how to party!"
"Squidward","  Oh yeah...they got one foot in the rave. Heh heh...reaper jerks!"
"Squidward"," Two, three, four!  Two, three, four! "
"SpongeBob","  Sorry sir."
"Squidward","  Ok, two, three, four..."
"Squidward"," Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party!  This is our WORSE gig yet Children parties! Well if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to...Owww!  I am not donkey-fish!"
"Squidward","  Mr. Krabs, how much farther is it to the next town?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh...not too much farther Squidward! Uh...oh in fact, we're just entering it now! "
"Squidward"," Well if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last!  What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Good bye! "
"Mr. Krabs"," This ain't our next concert!"
"Squidward"," Well then, where is it!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's uh...uh...um... Well it's right over there obviously!  I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I some important tour management business to attend to if you know!"
"Squidward"," Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yeah...I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh? Are there people showing up?"
"Squidward"," Isn't that...what you were talking about?  Ah...just soak on in Squidy old boy! Pretty invigorating isn't it? Wait a minute...why are they chanting ""Ned and the Needlefish?"""
"SpongeBob"," No, can't you hear them Squidward? They're saying Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward..."
"Squidward"," Wait! I know what you came here for!  Well?"
"Squidward"," Uh oh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Do I know you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Were we in the Navy together?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Phew, that's good! 'Cause for a second there I thought that we maybe..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute! Where'd you think you're going with your own equipment!?"
"Patrick"," Hey thanks again fellas! Nice guys like them don't come around much these days. They even redecorated the tour busmobile for us! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh the crowd went wild sir!"
"Squidward"," In fact, they're still going wild..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Quick! On the bus! "
"Squidward"," Well, that wasn't a complete waste of time...Oh no wait, it was..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Now I'll never get me ol' Krusty Krab out of hog! "
"SpongeBob"," MR. KRABS!!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good news boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!"
"Patrick"," Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't."
"Squidward"," What do you mean you can't?"
"Patrick"," Well..."
"Squidward"," No no! Wait! Let me guess You ate the spare tire?"
"Patrick"," Wow...you're good at guessing..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, why didn't you just ask me?  You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually.  Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!"

"Patrick"," Extreme spots? Well, that's no fair. You're already covers in extreme spots. Ooh. Hold on a second.  Okay, let's do meet our new heroes."
"SpongeBob"," We want to join your extreme spots team, as you can see, we're also covered head to toe in the most extreme of spots."
"SpongeBob"," No problemo. I guess you just hop up like this...  Hey! Come back!  Heeeeyyy! "
"Patrick"," Hey! How'd we get up here? "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I know. How 'bout a little something called Jump rope?"
"SpongeBob"," Ready Patrick? On your mark, get set, jump rope!"
"Patrick"," Extreme!  Hey, who's holding the other end?"
"SpongeBob"," I am of course.  Hi Patrick!"
"Patrick"," D'uh.  My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! What?"
"Patrick"," That's weird, my face is leaking."
"SpongeBob"," You're face isn't leaking. You're just sweating from all the exercise."
"Patrick"," Exercise?!  Eww, I didn't sign up for this! "
"SpongeBob"," Extreme!"
"SpongeBob"," Explosive, huh? I know just the thing!  Boom!  Impressed?"
"SpongeBob"," I think I do. Is fighting extreme?"
"Patrick"," I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around.  Oohh...We give up! Fling  That was close."
"SpongeBob"," Noo! It's dry-clean only!"
"SpongeBob"," Brutal."
"Patrick"," Even more brutal!"
"SpongeBob"," Well there is one sport that Patrick's an expert at."
"Patrick"," Dumpster diving!"
"Patrick","  How revolting. "
"Patrick"," That is one tough elderly person."
"SpongeBob"," Well, there is a very extremely extreme sport we play if you're up to it."
"Patrick"," Hey, where are the Drasticals?  Here they come!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Patrick"," Amazing!"
"Patrick"," Who is that guy?"
"Squidward"," It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home.  Quitting time!  Go home! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?"
"SpongeBob","  What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away.  Bleh!  But I do have to throw away the trash."
"SpongeBob","  What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books.  Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?"
"Sandy"," Heck no. I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin. It's all right here in The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book Of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records.  Look-e here, SpongeBob. Staring Record. 5 days. Most fries up nose. Holding your breath."
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Sandy"," Yes siree! I swear by the power of Texas, I'm gonna break all the records in this here book!"
"Sandy"," What's the next challenge?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue."
"Sandy"," Well, that's easy.  106, 107..."
"SpongeBob"," Hold tight, Sandy."
"Sandy"," ...108, 109, 110!"
"SpongeBob"," That's it, Sandy! You did it!"
"Sandy"," Yeehaw! "
"SpongeBob"," Let's see... Yikes! Sweet mother of Pearl!"
"Sandy"," Is it dangerous?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can."
"Sandy"," Chum, huh? That's not too bad."
"SpongeBob"," Raw!"
"Sandy","  Raw?!"
"Plankton"," You want what?"
"SpongeBob"," One order of chum, please."
"Sandy"," Raw."
"Plankton"," Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did."
"Plankton"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," For 30 seconds."
"Plankton"," Well, it's your funeral."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Sandy, eat up."
"Sandy"," Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh...  must make world record!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, you did it! You survived!  Uh, oh. Hold on, Sandy!  I know just what you need!  A Krabby Patty! "
"Sandy"," I did it! I'm alive! I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record breaking feats."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! I forgot my camera!"
"Sandy"," What?! SpongeBob! I need photographic proof of my amazing deeds!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll go get the camera."
"Sandy"," Well, hurry up! I got record breaking to do!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh my. "
"Sandy"," Got your camera?"
"SpongeBob"," You bet ya! "
"Sandy"," Great! Take a picture of me chucking this last woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. Ready Cousin Earl?"
"Sandy"," Thanks for all your help, cousins!  See you all next Christmas! Bye! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Sandy! What is all this?"
"Sandy"," I've decided to go about this scientifically. I feel with careful planning an precise delication of appropriate tasks, I can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time! Book! Picture!"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go."
"Sandy"," Thank you.  So, what's next? Oh yeah, longest tooth. So hows the calcium fusion going?"

"Sandy"," Thank you. Next, spiciest chili gargle. "
"SpongeBob"," Got it! You OK?  Do you smell soup?"
"Sandy"," What's next?"
"Sandy"," Woohoo! What's next?"
"SpongeBob","  Say ""cheese""!"
"Sandy"," Cheese! "
"SpongeBob","  Nice snakes. "
"Sandy"," Next!"
"Sandy"," Just! One! More! Oh no!  Next!"
"Sandy"," Ok, shoot!"
"SpongeBob","  Got it! So uh how do you stop?"
"Sandy"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," I said ""How do you stop?"""
"Sandy"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," How do you stop?"
"Sandy"," Why that's easy I just stop and run like heck!  Not that way!  Come on, SpongeBob! Pull yourself together! We still got a ton of records to break! Oh yeah! You're gonna love this one!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know, Sandy. It is getting kinda dangerous."
"Sandy"," Come on, you don't need your helmet. This one's outside! Follow me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh my."
"Sandy"," There it is, the world's largest house of cards!"
"SpongeBob"," That's amazing! Get in front so I can take a picture."
"Sandy"," Nah, let's get a shot from the top!"
"Patrick"," What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown! "
"Sandy"," What's next?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox better go clean it. Now!  I think you broke a record today, Gary. World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww!  I'm worried about Sandy. She's got record-breaking fever!"
"SpongeBob"," You're right. She does need my help. I must stop this madness! It's all that book's fault! The book is evil! The book must be destroyed!"
"SpongeBob","  Why don't you take 5? I will hold the book."
"Sandy"," Hey! Where do you think you're going? Get back in line. I need every available robot for this one. Most Robots built and destroyed in a day."
"Sandy"," OK shut her down!"
"Sandy"," What's wrong with you?"
"Sandy"," Well, let's have a look. SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh hey, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," I came to save you from, from this book. I'm going to destroy it before someone gets killed! I don't wanna lose you, Sandy!  I don't wanna lose you!"
"Sandy"," Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob. I'm done with that book! I've beat every record in here. In fact, I've been finding the author who verified my evidence."
"Sandy"," Good for you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Um, hurray!"
"SpongeBob","  What's the matter, buddy? You seem so sad."
"Patrick","  Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This. "
"SpongeBob"," My hat is sad?"
"Patrick"," No! You have a special hat, which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay...  bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place too! "
"SpongeBob"," First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?"
"Patrick"," Uhhh...  Sand."
"SpongeBob"," Oof!  Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip,  but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it. "
"Patrick"," Think about it. Think, Patrick think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh!  Thinking is painful.  Break time. "
"Patrick","  I gotta figure out what to do in my life.  Awww I wish I was a superhero.  I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room!   Ahhhhh. ]His body fat then bursts in between his belly and his moobs. He then grabs a giant ice cream cone from SpongeBob's fridge, suddenly with two blue gloves on his hands, and eats the ice cream and a portion of the cone. With ice cream on his mouth, he then slips this cone on his head and bulges his eyes through it. He grabs a jar of seanut butter and writes a backwards P on his chest with seanut butter on his tongue] At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man defender of Bikini Bottom! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!"
"Squidward"," Where? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Where is everybody?"
"Patrick"," Fear not, Patrick-Man is here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down. "
"Patrick"," It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?"
"Squidward"," Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area?  Hey Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?"
"Patrick"," Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!!"
"SpongeBob","  That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar- "
"Patrick"," Shush SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help!  Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?"
"Patrick"," Just remember this Violence solves nothing!"
"Patrick"," No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Please ma'am, allow me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hehehehe, not a problem ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo!  Sorry, lady, you're on you're own. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy. "
"Patrick"," Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But I found that dollar!"
"Patrick"," Nah, enough! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs.  With Neptune's swiftness, away! "
"Patrick"," Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man!  I'll finish you off later, day-old donuts. Right now I must move rapidly and act heroically!  What's this?  Don't move, and freeze!"
"Patrick"," Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!"
"Patrick"," Jammed doors, huh?  A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness,  away! "
"SpongeBob"," Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far. "
"Patrick"," Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you. "
"SpongeBob"," What're you doing out there?"
"Patrick"," Something a non-hero civilian would never understand.  I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes! "
"SpongeBob"," You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?"
"Patrick"," Overboaaard?! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's  Swiftness!  Villains and criminals, beware!  Patrick-Man is here! "
"Patrick"," And he always finds out who hides under the mask! "
"Patrick"," Oh, right.  Gotcha!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whaaaaaaaat? Alright, that does it!"
"Patrick"," Admit it, masked marauder!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Enough!  We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!"
"Patrick"," But I was about to unmask a supervillain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure you were.  What the barnacles are you doing?"
"Patrick"," Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!"
"SpongeBob"," Let her go, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," No way!  Hey! Where'd he come from?"
"SpongeBob","  The Dirty Bubble?!"
"Patrick"," The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray."
"SpongeBob"," What now, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff! "
"Patrick"," Take this, beast! "
"SpongeBob"," Wha, no, Patrick! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?"
"Patrick"," I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! "
"Patrick"," Lunch! "
"SpongeBob"," Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?"
"Patrick"," Why of course, young man. That's uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?"
"SpongeBob"," What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?"
"Patrick"," Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time. "
"Patrick"," What's this?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. Gary, have you been chewing on my alarm clock again? Oh well.  Up and at 'em.  Eww. Gary, not my slippers, too! Huh, Nasty.  Eurgh. Oral hygiene to the rescue!  What the hey? Come on, Gary!  Let go!  Coochie coochie coo!  Golly, Gary, what's gotten into you? Are you bored? I'll play with you later.  Gary!  Gary, you are a nut. Sheesh!"
"SpongeBob","  That snail sure is acting weird. It's like he's teething again.  Hey, hold on a second...Gary, have you been chewing on my bowl?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm beginning to sense a pattern here.  Gary, are you trying to tell me something? Could it be that what you need is a new chew toy?  I thought so.  "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I bet they have lots of toys here. Hey look, there's Patrick! Howdy, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hey SpongeBob, Gareth."
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing here? You don't have a pet."
"Patrick"," Confidentially, I'm just here for the free samples.  Mmm, you can really taste the gourmet.  Oh Thank you, ma'am, I may consider purchasing this brand for my worms.  Want some?"
"SpongeBob"," No thanks, just had breakfast. We're here to buy Gary a new toy."
"Patrick"," They're on aisle 3, next to the most delicious snail treats. Follow me!  Here they are! Tasty Time snail treats. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, how about this one?  OK, how about this? Well?  Yeah, I don't think so. "
"Patrick"," Hey, guys, check this out!  A Pet Point 3000!"
"SpongeBob"," A pet toy that plays with your pet! What do you think, Gary?"
"Patrick"," It's so futuristic.  Look, a red dot!  Come back here!"
"SpongeBob"," That's brilliant! What will they think of next?"
"Patrick"," I love this thing! Let's turn it up!  Huh?  Where did it go?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Huh? Oh, there it is. Hey, do you smell something burning? "
"SpongeBob"," Here, you might need this. You know, I'm not sure that toy is safe for Gary. Where is Gary, anyway? Gary? "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary!  Hey, where'd you come from? I wonder if Gary would like this ball. Ga-  I guess you do. "
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to play with your new ball?  Here it is, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," You want it, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," OK, boy, go and get it! Go and get it! Go and get it! Fetch! "
"SpongeBob"," OK, Gary, bring it back!  C'mon, Gary, bring it back.  You're supposed to bring it … back … Ah well, as long as he's not chewing on my stuff.   I wonder how Gary's doing? I haven't heard a squeak out of him.  Gary? Hmm, where is that snail? Gary, where are you?  Gary, I- oh, there you are!  Oh, a tea party, cute! Do you mind if I join you? I just love a spot of tea.  What kind of tea is it? Green tea? Earl gray? Oolong? Slippery elm?  Gee, I think he likes that ball more than me.  Deugh! That is not tea."
"SpongeBob"," I know what will get Gary's attention. Good old Slimycan!  Here you go, Ga-  Darn it, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, dinner time! Gary!  Gary?  OK, that's just creepy. Gary, I think you need to spend some time away from this ball.  This isn't helping your case. "
"SpongeBob"," OK, Gary, fun is fun, now give me that ball, pronto! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, so you've hidden it?  Oh no you don't, come here! I bet I know where it is.  Hairball. Hairball. Wallet. Darn it, I thought I lost this … and I just cancelled my credit cards! Hairball. Toothbrush. Aha!  I knew it!  You'll see. Some time apart will do you good.  There we go, out of sight, out of mind. I know you're upset now but wait until tomorrow morning.  Why, you probably won't even remember that old ball. "
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Gary! I hope you're not still mad at me. Gary? The ball!  I will not tolerate this disobedience, Gary!  Gary, I'm not playing around, you had better show yourself this instant. OK, get down here! Hm.  Gary, give me that ball.  C'mon! Hnn! Get down!  Mother always said, “don't run with the broom”. I'll take that!  Gary, how could you! You are going to have to make a choice. It's either me, or the-  Ball. Fine. I hope you two will be very happy. Together. Without me. Goodbye. "
"SpongeBob"," And so it's come to this. No home, no best friend, and sleeping under a bus stop.  Hello, little nematode. Will you be my friend?  Atta boy.  Dahaha, that tickles!  Hey, my wallet! Good thing I cancelled those credit cards. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary! I mean, oh hey. What are you doing here, waiting for a bus?  Oh, Gary, does this mean you've come to love me more than that chew toy?"
"SpongeBob"," Yippee!  Look, we're closer than ever.  Come on, Gary, let's go home.  Do you smell something burning?  Hey, look, isn't that your ball? "
"SpongeBob","  Another order? Ok! Get ready Spaty! Time to grill up one more golden-piping hot Krabby Patt-wha? Double dipped milkshake? Gee! I haven't made one of those in awhile!  Order up!  One double dipped milkshake!  Wait! I almost forgot!  Cherry on top! There you are sir! A perfect double dipped milkshake! Enjoy!"
"SpongeBob"," A license to milkshake? Well of course I do silly!  And it doesn't expire until......seven years ago!?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey now! Let's not say things we might regret later! Tell you what,  you come back tomorrow and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake.  Alright! See you tomorrow! "
"SpongeBob"," Where are we going, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm taking you back to school!"
"Mr. Krabs","  There you are boy!  The Milkshake Academy! You know boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!"
"SpongeBob"," I shall do my best sir!"
"SpongeBob","  Mmmm!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir! Worthy and ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's easy! It's an ice cream spatula! "
"SpongeBob","  A few more bells and whistles than I'm used to. But I think I can work with this!  Oh dear! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! That's right! Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right.  Milkshaking has changed over the years. "
"SpongeBob"," That was fun! Can I go again?"
"SpongeBob"," I'll show you! I'll show you all I can make a milkshake! "
"SpongeBob"," Um... the printer ran out of ink?"
"SpongeBob","  Why not?"
"SpongeBob","  NO Captain Frostymug! I can do it! Let me show you! I just know I can! "
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong Captain Frostymug?"
"SpongeBob"," Captain Frostymug!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry sir! I'm coming!  Gotcha Captain!"
"SpongeBob"," No! I'm not leaving you behind! "
"SpongeBob"," Not at all..."
"SpongeBob"," One milkshake, coming right up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Gasp! My milkshake license! If only it were this easy to get a boating license! "
"Squidward"," What the! Barnacles!"
"Patrick"," How do you like that, baby?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh yeah. Well, what do ya think about this, baby? "
"Squidward"," Question. Are you two acting even more infantile than usual this morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh. Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes  me back. "
"Patrick","  Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby. "
"SpongeBob","  Babies don't talk like that Patrick. They talk like... "
"Squidward"," Just as the essential oils were kicking in.  Hey! I'd appreciate some quiet!  How dare you scoot away from me, I'm scolding here!  Would you two for once, act your age!  Fine! Act like infants you're whole life! See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down! "
"Patrick"," Hey, He's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. He should probably see a doctor. Come on let's take him to the hospital."
"Patrick"," Hang in there buddy. we'll have you fixed up in no time. "
"SpongeBob"," What's the prognosis doctor?"
"Patrick"," Hey little Squidward. Ready to have some fun? Woop-ee-doo! "
"SpongeBob"," Ok Squidie! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle?  Patrick how could you!  There! My little darling. Were supposed to protect his head remember?  Ok Squidie! I made your favorite. Grilled Tar Tar with a algae vinaigrette.  Here it comes, open wide!  Come on little buddy you got eat healthy so you can grow up to be big and cranky. Just like the airplane in the hanger.  See Patrick sometimes you have to out-think the baby.  You know Patrick maybe..."
"Patrick","  Ahh, Thanks for sharing baby"
"SpongeBob"," Ok. Time to lighten things up. Do you like games Squidie?"
"Patrick"," Games? Games is our middle name!"
"SpongeBob"," You like that Squidie?"
"Patrick"," He does. "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, This game's kinda dangerous. "
"Patrick"," Don't worry. I got this. "
"SpongeBob"," Hooray. Huh. Squidward!  Squidie are you ok?  We need to do a better job of protecting him. "
"SpongeBob"," There, there now, no need to cry about. "
"Patrick"," Don't worry he'll be settled down in couple of minutes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's 1 minute till opening. Where the barnacles are me employeries? I don't pay them to be late. "
"Patrick"," Taking care of a baby sure is hard."
"SpongeBob"," You said it! I'm exhausted! Hey, Patrick. I have to go to work. Would you mind holding Squidw....  I guess it's just you and me, little fella."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties.  The poor guy has the mind of an infant."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money. "
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"Mr. Krabs"," No buts! Get to work, you two!"
"SpongeBob","  All settled into your work station, I see. Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all! Now let's make it official!  Oh, how silly of me!  Squiddy needs a high chair!  And duct tape!  Oh, Squiddy! I'm so proud of you! Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me! And look at you now, working and sitting in a big boy seat! "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right! That's enough, you two. Time to serve some customers! "
"SpongeBob"," Remember, buddy! I'll be right behind you!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! That's not for eating!  There we are. Good as neww-!  That's not for eating either!  Sorry, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hop to it, boys. We haven't even taken our first order!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs.  You know what to do.  Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on huh...  Will this be for here or to goo?  We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What in blazes is going on around he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward!  Where are your manners?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, watch his head!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Watch his head? Why don't you watch his diaper?  And get it changed!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! Yes, sir!  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry!  Ok, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you out of your ever-living mind?! We can't change that baby out here in front of the customers! Take him in back where the food is prepared.  Oh, that's it! Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, if my poopy baby isn't welcome here, then I'm not staying either!  Squidward! "
"Squidward"," What the? Where am I? What's going on?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, you're back to your normal grown-up self."
"Squidward"," Of course I'm grown up! Why wouldn't I be?!  Am I wearing a diaper?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Is it full? "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward! I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra... "
"Squidward"," Stop! Not another word about this! Ever!"
"SpongeBob"," Kids, they grow up so fast."
"Squidward","  Ahhh, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty. "
"Squidward"," Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty. "
"Squidward","  Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the!  Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties.  SPONGEBOB!  Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers. "
"SpongeBob","  I got it. "
"Squidward"," Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there?  An old book?"
"SpongeBob","  Nothing."
"Squidward"," What's going on here?"
"Squidward"," Hmmm.  If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it. "
"SpongeBob"," I'll take that, thank you. "
"Squidward","  There he goes again, scribbling away in that little book.  I must admit, my curiosity is peaked... I guess I'm ""peaked"" to ""peek"" at that book.  Oh, puns. "
"Squidward","  Hey SpongeBob, you need to make a delivery."
"SpongeBob","  Okie-Dokie!"
"Squidward"," The address is on the bag."
"SpongeBob"," I got it. "
"Squidward","  It's a diary! Oh-ho-ho. This is gonna be good. Huh? Drat, it's locked.  Hmm. I need a hairpin.  And now... the diary of a moron. "
"SpongeBob"," ""Dear diary, what an amazing day I've...""  ...day I've had.  This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward.  He had some very important news he was just bursting to share.  He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet.  Specifically, what not to feed them.  The list was very thorough.  Needless to say, this is all very enlightening.  It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique--  Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are. ' Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short.  And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year,  cleaning day!  Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab,  and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots.  Ah yes, cleaning day. "
"Squidward"," Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right.  Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible. "
"Patrick","  Oh, boy!  A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been.  Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, uh, one of the customers dropped his watch in a toilet, and I need you to fish it out. "
"SpongeBob","  Duty calls."
"Squidward"," What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious."
"Squidward"," It says here, when SpongeBob see plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast.  I just got me new kilt today."
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?"
"SpongeBob","  I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--"
"SpongeBob"," And that guy."
"Squidward"," What do you think of Mr. Krabs' new plaid kilt?"
"SpongeBob"," P-p-p-p-plaid? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you don't have to be nasty about it!"
"SpongeBob","  Avert your eyes, SquarePants.  I have to take my break! "
"Squidward","  Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula ""Fifi."""
"Patrick","  Who ever heard of naming a spatula Fifi? It's a girl's name! Right, Frank? "
"SpongeBob","  I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, cook me up a Krabby Patty... with good old Fifi."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, sure thing.  Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?"
"Squidward"," Oh, oh, this is the best one yet. Get this ""If I hear the Bikini Bottom Municipal Anthem, I can't help but take off all my clothes and dance around in my underwear!""  Quiet, quiet, quiet. Watch this.  "
"SpongeBob"," My... DIARY! Squidward! How could you?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize."
"Squidward","  He'll get over it. "
"Squidward"," Oh boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm.  Taxi! "
"Squidward"," Yes, I am. "
"Squidward"," Morons. "
"Squidward","  What?"
"Squidward"," Ow! "
"Patrick"," Diary reader! "
"Squidward"," What!? You read it too!"
"Patrick"," Oh, sure, blame everyone but yourself. Oh, that is so you. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. How's it going?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me."
"SpongeBob"," What for?"
"Squidward"," For reading your diary."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you.  Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary.  Now, that would have been really embarrassing."
"SpongeBob"," People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! How could you?! "
"Squidward"," I don't care. This is so worth it! "
"SpongeBob","  Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test.  Mrs. Puff, you OK?"
"SpongeBob"," Right away, ma-am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control... , and crashing through the ramp and the flaming hoop]"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-"
"SpongeBob"," I...I...  I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth?  Come back later; I'm wallowing. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un- ] "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?"
"SpongeBob"," It's not working!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, where are we?"
"SpongeBob"," Dr-iving test?!"
"SpongeBob","  But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!"
"SpongeBob"," O-o-okay.  Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff."
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road, the open intimidating road."
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road."
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road."
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road! "
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road...  There is nothing but the road. "
"SpongeBob"," Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus...  on the...road? What happened to the road!?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh...  The road!"
"SpongeBob"," That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it. "
"SpongeBob"," Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?! "
"SpongeBob"," Right. ""Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road""  I can't even see the road! . "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes! "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Oh! Okay! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've made a mess. And that means...  ...Cleaning Time!  My eyes!  My spray...  Oh no, it rolled...  ...beneath the grill!  I can do this.  Nope!  Ah ha! Gotcha!  An urchin! "
"Squidward"," Nothing ever happens in this dump..."
"SpongeBob","  Squid!"
"Squidward"," Why did I say that?"
"SpongeBob","  Ward!"
"Squidward","  Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," Help!"
"Squidward","  What!?"
"Squidward","  What are you screaming about!?"
"SpongeBob","  Sea urchin! Geh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  What's all the ruckus!?"
"SpongeBob"," There's an urchin in the kitchen!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you talking about? The Krusty Krab is a standard in fast food cleanliness! An urchin wouldn't dare step hide into this establishment.   The grill is still on...isn't it?"
"SpongeBob"," There it is!  I'll get it!  Got it! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hold it right there!  Gotcha you prickly pest!  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Don't let it in the dining room! You're our last line of defense!"
"Squidward"," I'm on it. "
"SpongeBob"," This is terrible! You should never put that much ketchup on a Krabby Patty. "
"Squidward"," I think I'm gonna be sick!"
"SpongeBob"," Phew! That was close! Thank goodness no one noticed the urchin..."
"Plankton","  Heh! Heh! Finally! I have a fool-proof plan to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Krabs will never recognize me wearing......these glasses!  What in the seahorse is going on around here!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton!? Ah that's all we need. Beat it ya crook! We have enough pests already!"
"Plankton"," Pests!? What are you talking about?  An urchin!  I hate those things! This won't do at all. I can't steal the Secret Formula with that varmint running around!  I propose a truce Krabs I'll help you get rid of that creature and I'll promise not to steal the Secret Formula until it's gone. Crook's honor."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm...it may take a pest to catch a pest.  It's a deal! But no tricks, or you'll be the chef's special!"
"Plankton"," Don't worry.  Karen?  No I don't have it. Why do you even bother asking!?  Yeah, yeah...Look! Send over my killer-death robot would you?  No, the other one.  I love you too snookums...Help's on it's way!  Behold! Your champion!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That piece of junk!?"
"Plankton"," Hold on! You haven't seen it in action yet!  I'll just set it for our query.  No... Ignore that one... Ah ha! Bingo! You have your orders, attack!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no, you don't!  Grrrrr.....  Mallet please! "
"Plankton"," Ok. Maybe the Death Robot wasn't the best idea..."
"Mr. Krabs"," You think? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Here sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That little monster's still in there. You open the register, and I'll catch him in here "
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye captain! Here goes nothing..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Me money!  Did I get it!?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh...Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs","  "
"Squidward"," Oh no! Oh no! Oh no no no no no no!  Yes! Oh, my prized spiny succulent! Thank Neptune you're safe!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! Look!  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Plankton"," I'm not sure I like where this is heading..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Cactus?"
"SpongeBob","  Cactus."
"Mr. Krabs","  Spoon?"
"SpongeBob","  Spoon."
"Mr. Krabs","  Plankton?"
"SpongeBob","  Plankton."
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Plankton"," Oh, come on! There's gotta be a better way!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Spray can?"
"SpongeBob","  Spray can."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm...I think our darling little decoy still needs something..."
"Plankton","  Oh brother..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Now get in there, Planktonella, and lure that little rotten health hazard out of me livelihood! "
"Plankton"," I'm only helping you out so I can get back to robbing you blind!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Plankton! We're behind you one hundred percent!"
"Plankton","  This getup is one hundred percent humiliating. Here urchin, urchin, urchin!  Here you dirty filth-spreading porcupine. I'm wearing lipstick here. Come on, let's go!  Huh? What was that? Look sharp Planktonella. I think we're being watched  Ah!  Uh...hello?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Psst! Go on, Plankton! Make with the romance!"
"Plankton"," Fine  H-h-hey there handsome! You're cute!...for a parasite. Whoa there, buddy! Why don't we start with a nice romantic stroll? Outside, far away from the Krusty Krab! And the Secret Formula... Ok! Ouch!  Hey! What kind of an urchin do you think I am!?   What could be worse than being romantically pursued by a ravage sea urchin!?  A hundred urchins! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Get ready! Here they come!"
"Plankton"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Holy mother of Pearl! Batten down the hatches!  It's a stampede!"
"Plankton","  Come on! Let me out!  Mommy!  Come on! Open up!  Help! Get me out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Poor Plankton..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, who cares about Plankton? What about me restaurant?"
"Plankton"," I heard that!"
"Squidward"," Enough's enough!  It's time to end this madness! Let's put this freak show on ice! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! What do you know! That seems to be slowing 'em down! Better crank it all the way down, just to be on the safe side!  That outta do it! "
"SpongeBob"," Gasp! It's beautiful! "
"SpongeBob"," Ok, I'm ready!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here goes nothing! "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry Squidward!  We got them! Whoa! Got it!"
"Squidward"," Phew..."
"SpongeBob","  So where do we release them?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't care. As long it's far away from the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob","  How's this Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Keep going!"
"SpongeBob","  How about now!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Farther! "
"SpongeBob"," Is this far enough?"
"Mr. Krabs","  No! Farther!  Well, that takes care of that particular problem!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob","  Is this far enough?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not far enough! Keep going!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess this is far enough. Here you go little fellas! This will be your new home!  Run! Be free!  Uh oh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hiii... yah!  Squidward! Sorry, buddy, didn't see you. Are you okay?"
"Squidward","  What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. I'm just practicing my  karate chops. I'm going to have  an intense karate session with Sandy later. Sandy says you never know what creepy creeper could be creeping creepingly around any creepy corner."
"Squidward"," Paranoid much?"
"SpongeBob","  Hiyah!  Sorry, Squidward! I thought you were one of those creepy creepers. You know, Squidward, you really should know how to protect yourself. Maybe you'd like to join us."
"Squidward"," Well... no. I have more important things to do."
"SpongeBob"," Okey dokey, Squidward! Stop on by later if you change your mind about the karate."
"Squidward","  I won't.  Uh... hello? Is somebody there?  Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer!  Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your earholes?  I gotta get outta here!  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh wait, I don't get it."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Hurry, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? What's wrong?"
"Squidward"," You were rrrright!"
"SpongeBob"," I was? About what?"
"Squidward"," About the danger that lurks around every corner! "
"SpongeBob"," Um, Squidward?  It's just Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I should've named you ""Scary,"" eh buddy?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this is serious! I was just viciously attacked!"
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Squidward"," You gotta teach me, SpongeBob! Teach me the way! The way of tarake."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, don't you mean ""karate?"""
"Squidward"," Um... sure. Whatever."
"SpongeBob","  Hmm... hmm! Hmm... yes! You show potential young student!  But with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in this area  you obviously have our work cut out for us."
"Squidward"," Can't we just get on with this SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," See see ba ba!"
"Squidward"," Sigh... I mean can't get just get on with this ""O Great Sensei?"""
"SpongeBob"," Play close attention and you will receive the totality of my karate mastery! Handed down from Sensei Cheeks herself. Now watch! Watch and learn. "
"Squidward"," Uh huh. What else you got?"
"SpongeBob"," That's it."
"Squidward"," That's it!? THAT'S the ""totality"" of your karate mastery?"
"Squidward"," Oh boy..."
"Sandy"," I don't know, SpongeBob.  With the rubbery arms and doughiness in this area , we obviously-"
"Squidward"," -Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?"
"Sandy"," Whoa, oh, oh! Karate ain't for revenge. It's a delicate art that helps you protect yourself!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, fine."
"Sandy"," Great! Now repeat after me HIYAH!"
"SpongeBob"," HIYAH! "
"Squidward"," Oh...whatever. Hiyah..."
"Sandy"," ""I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."""
"Squidward"," ""I promise to use karate only for protection and not for revenge."" Or whatever..."
"Sandy"," Okay then! Let's get started with a little choppin'! Like so. HIYAH! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"Squidward"," A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!"
"Sandy"," The only way to protect yourself is if you know the basics. Now give it a chop!"
"Squidward"," Sigh...whatever you say Sensei..."
"SpongeBob"," This is a tough one Squidward. Don't feel bad if you can't do it."
"Squidward"," I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii-YAH! "
"Sandy"," Arms up Squidward! Block! Block!  Block! Block!"
"Squidward"," Arg! This is stupid! The only thing this maniac threw at me were his big, meaty fists! "
"SpongeBob","  Block!"
"Sandy"," Now that's how you do it!"
"Squidward"," Dimwits luck! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squiddy! Give it the ol' roundhouse!"
"Squidward"," Alright...  Hiyah!  This isn't working!  My assailant was twice as tall! And shoulders were twenty times as broad! The burrows of his brow with the size as biceps!"
"Sandy"," Hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you Squidward. So is to help you bring out your inner dragon! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey! Grocery boy! It is me! A big, scary miscreant! Now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly!"
"Squidward"," Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah!  Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH!  Got you... right where...I want you!  Vengeance... is... MINE!"
"Sandy"," Vengeance? Squidward Tentacles, I told ya at the beginning that karate ain't for revenge! Sorry Squidward. As of now, I ain't your sensei no more! "
"Squidward"," Sandy! Wait!  I need you to teach... ... this is pointless.  I'll never be able to protect myself.  I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal!  Take my unprocessed kale cream."
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Wait! Please! Help him! He just want to keep his organic, blue algae safe."
"Sandy"," He's going to use my teachings for revenge SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Please Sandy! I'll do anything!"
"Sandy"," Oh really? Well Squidward, a wise sensei once told me  ""One must first know the movements of everyday, to master ka-rah-tay!"
"Squidward"," Phew! All finished!"
"Sandy"," Wow! It looks great!"
"SpongeBob","  Psst! You missed a spot!"
"Sandy"," Alright! I reckon that yard is good and watered!"
"SpongeBob"," Psst! You missed a spot!"
"Squidward"," Shut up! Phew! "
"Sandy"," Atta boy Squiddy!  Be sure to twist that torso!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy?  I don't remember this being a part of my training."
"Sandy"," It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet! "
"Squidward"," That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time!  Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!"
"Sandy"," Ye-HAAA! I told y'all had to do is know the movements of everyday to master karate!"
"Squidward"," Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!"
"SpongeBob","  YEAH YEAH! Now try this!"
"Squidward"," Okay! Okay! Hee-YAH!  Hah hah hah! Oh, I did it!  Hee-YAH!  I can protect my groceries now! Hee-YAH!  I am a karate master! WOO HOO HOO!"
"Sandy"," Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of...  ...the Belt of Basic Competence!"
"Squidward"," Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to!  Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens!  This time!"
"Squidward"," Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store!  Hee-YAH!  HEE-YAH!  Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows!  Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you!  Okay buddy, I warned ya!  I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH! "
"Squidward"," Hah! Hah! How do you like them apples? YAH! "
"Squidward","  Hah! Feel my wrath!  How's your uncle!"
"Squidward"," My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH! "
"Squidward","  Uh, oh. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! I found him! He's over here!  You forgot your belt silly! "
"Sandy"," Gosh! What happened to you?"
"SpongeBob"," This guy's been... ka-rah-tayed!"
"Sandy"," After all I'd said about never using karate for revenge?"
"SpongeBob"," For shame, Squidward. For shame."
"Sandy"," Looks like he's not worthy of this belt after all.  Thanks for dishonoring our trust in you Squidward. ."
"Squidward"," Whatever! I'm still a karate master!"
"Squidward"," Yes I am!"
"Squidward"," And what is that suppose to mean?"
"Squidward"," Okay already! I get it!  What? Wait a second. Am I under arrest?"
"Plankton","  Yeah, yeah! Keep your shirt on!"
"SpongeBob"," Psst! Hey, Sheldon!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob?! What in the sea shell are you doing here?!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs arranged for me to work here on weekends. He wants me to keep an eye on you!"
"Plankton"," Excuse me. Doesn't this count as ""cruel and unusual punishment""?"
"SpongeBob","  Look! They even gave me a training baton! "
"SpongeBob","  Hi Karen!  Look Plankton! Karen came to visit and she brought you a cake! "
"Plankton"," Do you mind?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh uh, I'll be right over here. "
"Plankton"," So honey? Is ""you know what"" inside?"
"Plankton"," No! Uh, no. The ""secret ingredient."""
"Plankton"," I mean the file?"
"Plankton","  Karen, you got to get me out of here! "
"Plankton","  Phew..."
"Plankton"," I'm not even sure what ""that"" is..."
"Plankton"," Wait a second! I didn't say you could-"
"Plankton","  Hey! I need that! For my bones! "
"SpongeBob"," Tsk, tsk, tsk. Someone didn't finish their beans!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Well, enjoy! "
"Plankton","  Wait! Put me down!  Uh oh... You can't eat me! I'm Bikini Bottom's most evil genius!"
"Plankton","  I say I'm Plankton blast it!"
"Plankton","  Hey! I'm in here! I'm Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Are we at the airport?  Ahem! Hey! Gather 'round fellow convicts! It is I the one and only Sheldon J. Plankton, evil genius!"
"Plankton"," Now let me get this straight, you low-lives respect me?"
"Plankton","  With this pack of criminals, I can steal the Secret Formula like that!"
"Plankton"," Ok gang! We need to bust out of this joint! Any thoughts? "
"Plankton"," Yeah, I can see why you're still in jail. Think, people! We need a plan!"
"Plankton"," Yeah! Good old chum. Say what now?"
"Plankton"," Chum? What use is chum?"
"Plankton"," You ever tried eating it?"
"Plankton"," But have you tried it on a bun?"
"Plankton"," Really? Maybe I overlooked chum's hidden potential! Fellow ne'r-do-wells If its chum you want its chum you shall have! Luckily, I happen to know the recipe! It's time for a jailbreak! "
"Plankton"," Listen up reprobates! Chum requires specialized ingredients of the highest quality!"
"Plankton"," Hmm...you there!  Sniff this sock!  Yes...let us begin! Cultured fungus growth medium!"
"Plankton"," Subtropical, vegetal matter!"
"Plankton"," Organic filler."
"Plankton"," Hey you!  Blow.  Live bacterial culture.  Now, to secure the containment vessel.  Agitate primarily compound!  And quality inspection!  Ok boys! I think it's time we evacuated this institution! "
"Plankton"," Sigh. It's time to break out of prison, you dopes!"
"SpongeBob"," A jailbreak!? I got to warn Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Not bad. If only I could paint him smaller."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What is it!?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton is breaking out of jail tonight! And he's coming to the Krusty Krab with a bunch of criminals to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula!  What do we do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tonight eh? That doesn't leave me much time! This is gonna be close, but we'll be ready for them! "
"Plankton"," Chum!  Detonator!  Is this detonator made out of soap?"
"Plankton"," Launch me! "
"Plankton","  Uh oh... It worked! "
"Plankton"," What in the name of electrolysis!?"
"Plankton"," Oh my! That is a dilly of a pickle! Oh well, if you cannot escape through the back wall, I guess we have to leave through the front door!  Quickly my fellow felonons! Follow me to the Krusty Krab! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh Mr. Krabs! They're almost here! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry SpongeBob! We're ready for 'em!"
"Plankton"," I gave you your freedom, now bring me the Krabby Patty Formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," They got past me!  Me restaurant!"
"Plankton"," Yes! With my new gang of vicious convicts, you're no match for me now Krabs! Fellow jailbirds, bring me the Krabby Patty formula! "
"Plankton"," Did you tried looking in the safe?"
"Plankton"," Eureka! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton! Don't do it!"
"Plankton"," Sorry Krabs! Nothing can stop me now! "
"Plankton"," What's happening!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob warned me you're planning a jailbreak so I took the precaution of hiding the entire Bikini Bottom Police Force in me safe!"
"Plankton","  Hey! Watch where you're pointing that thing buster!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, thanks to your hard work, the Krabby Patty recipe is safe!"
"SpongeBob"," And you win again! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yep! I'm a winner!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just a couple more additives, SpongeBob.  Oh and try not to breathe the fumes."
"SpongeBob"," Is it toxic patty Tuesday?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Barnacles, no.  The customers keep passing off their dirty money. So we're cooking up the only solution powerful enough to clean it."
"SpongeBob"," Well then, let's get cleaning."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, kiddo. We still have one more ingredient. "
"SpongeBob"," How much do we need?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Careful, SpongeBob! Just two drops and that stuff could..."
"SpongeBob"," Got it. Two drops... "
"Mr. Krabs"," ...blow our faces off."
"SpongeBob"," Fax coming through, boss."
"Mr. Krabs"," We can get it later."
"Plankton","  Infiltration achieved. Phase one, complete.  Now for phase two.  Sabotage!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, my dependable spatula, shall we? "
"Plankton"," Wow, phase two is great! My favorite phase so far. "
"SpongeBob","  No pulse.  We're losing him! Hang in there, buddy!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What's all the ruckus?"
"SpongeBob","  Clear! Clear!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pull yourself together, boy. So your spatula snapped. Go get yourself a new one!"
"SpongeBob","  I'll never forget you."
"Mr. Krabs","  Quit that, boy. It's creepy. Spatulas can't talk.  And if I catch yous talking to your next one, I'll lock you up in a padded kitchen. "
"Plankton","  Just like clockwork. The twerp approaches.  Time for phase three. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh hi, Plankton!  What brings you to Harvey's Spatula Emporium?"
"Plankton"," Oh, just picking up one of these.  Not that you'd know what it is."
"SpongeBob"," Well, judging from its diameter and vermillion color, I am looking at the handle cap for a vintage Grill Force 700 Spatula."
"Plankton"," Wow! A fellow spatula enthusiast, I see. You're right, SpongeBob. But with a few modifications, it'll serve as the end-cap for my SizzleMaster."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I've never even heard of that model."
"Plankton"," Well, there is only one. And some say it has magical grilling powers."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I must know more."
"Plankton"," Well, you could come over and check it out."
"SpongeBob"," That sounds thrilling! But I do need to hurry back to work."
"Plankton","  SpongeBob, it's a magical spatula with a legend. This is a one-in-a-lifetime experience.  Onward to the Chum Bucket!  Hey it's this way, kid. "
"Plankton"," Feast your absorbent eyes on this! "
"SpongeBob","  Wow. This is the greatest spatula collection on the whole sea floor."
"Plankton"," These are nothing compared to......the majestic SizzleMaster! "
"Plankton"," Yes, SpongeBob. I believe the SizzleMaster has found its fry cook in you!  The legend of the SizzleMaster has been fulfilled.  And since you are its fry cook, it will reduce your workload tenfold!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that rhymes. Almost. "
"Plankton"," Yes, a legend has been fulfilled today. Go forth, SpongeBob. Wouldn't want you to miss the lunch rush.  Or as I like to call it, ""Phase 4."""
"Plankton"," Enough, my sarcastic wife. Enough to gain SpongeBob's trust, then steal the Krabby Patty formula right from under his dumb yellow nose!  Now to tune in SpongeBoob."
"SpongeBob","  I'm back, Mr. Krabs. Did I miss anything?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh! "
"SpongeBob"," These orders have really piled up. "
"Squidward"," And don't forget these. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, nothing me and the SizzleMaster can't handle."
"Plankton","  That's right, SpongeBob! Let's show this lunch rush what for!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. I must be hearing things, 'cause Mr. Krabs says spatulas can't talk."
"Plankton","  Well I can! The mystical SizzleMaster can do all!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs said he'd put me in a padded kitchen if he caught me talking to you."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  I wasn't talking to my spatula!"
"Squidward"," I don't care if you were. The customers are about to snap! "
"SpongeBob"," Time to focus. "
"Plankton","  You know, SpongeBob, there's a much faster way to do this."
"SpongeBob"," Oh?  Wow, pretty good. But we're a long, long way from filling all these orders."
"Plankton","  Hey Sponge, I know a way to double our productivity. I'll handle things here at the grill, alone, while you man the condiments, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That's a great idea! But you man the condiments, I'll take the grill. Sorry, but I don't trust anyone with this baby, but me."
"Plankton","  Drat!"
"Squidward"," Stay back, you ravenous brutes. Oh!"
"SpongeBob","  Orders, ahoy! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, SizzleMaster, you truly are magical. We're catching up. But we got an empty grill here."
"Plankton","  Leave it to me, kid. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, good night, boyo. Headin' home. Thanks for all the extra greenbacks you earned me today. "
"SpongeBob"," Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs.  Thank my new magic talking spatula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, that's great SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas? Only do it if it makes me money. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you can really do wonders, SizzleMaster. Today was great. "
"Plankton","  It sure was, SpongeBob. And maybe tomorrow I can even handle the grill for you, huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Unlikely. But a spatula can dream. See you tomorrow."
"Plankton","  Dang it! I need SpongeBob to trust me behind that grill for this plan to work. Hmm. Oh! Hey SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Plankton","  How about you take me back to your place tonight? I mean, I could help you around the house."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not going to be grilling tonight, but thank you."
"Plankton","  Oh, I am so much more than a patty flipper."
"Plankton","  I'm a multipurpose tool."
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Hey, do you clean snail litter boxes?"
"Plankton","  Sure!"
"Plankton"," It's not like it's actually me touching it, so..."
"SpongeBob"," Here she is. Home sweet pineapple."
"Plankton","  Infiltration complete. Time to execute phase five! "
"SpongeBob","  You're such a joyful being, SizzleMaster. Here's that litter box you said you'd clean. "
"Plankton","   Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoop! "
"SpongeBob"," Mmm, mmm. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow! I'm three hours early to work. Thanks to you, SizzleMaster."
"Plankton","  That's no problem, buddy.  Hey, why don't you take a seat while I get to work for you?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, don't mind if I do. "
"Plankton","  Would you like me to man the grill for you today?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, eh..."
"Plankton","   You deserve a break. And I've been able to handle everything else for you, so..."
"SpongeBob"," That is true. Well, I guess I can trust you with my grill while I take a brief respite."
"Plankton","   Yes! Phase five is finally complete! Time to kick phase six into overdrive!  Yes, burn patties, burn! "
"SpongeBob","  Charred Krabby Patty bits? SizzleMaster, what happened?"
"Plankton","  Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no!"
"Plankton","  Hey, I got an idea!  I can mix up some new patties in a jiff. If we just go get the Krabby Patty secret formula."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. Okay. It's just over here in the safe."
"Plankton"," Yes! Ye-e-es. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey, whatcha doin', boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my new magical talking spatula that I got from Plankton says it needs your Krabby Patty secret formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so?  Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think your blinker's broken."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just read it."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye! Okay SizzleMaster, the first ingredient is... five gallons combustible cooking oil."
"Plankton","  Yes! Karen, begin production! "
"SpongeBob"," One sack coral dust, extra spicy. One bucket fire algae paste. And the final ingredient, disulfide."
"Plankton"," Y-y-yes!  Wait how much disulfide?"
"SpongeBob","  The whole enchilada."
"Plankton","  I had no idea this stuff was approved for restaurant use."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, it's not... Plankton."
"Plankton"," Krabs?  Oh, no. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quite a volatile concoction, eh, Planky?"
"SpongeBob"," Must be explosive patty Wednesday, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You got that right, boyo. "
"Plankton","  Oh, hardy-har-har!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Do you know how to swim?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick"," Me neither."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon.  Patrick, you're floating!"
"Patrick"," Oh.  Hey, you're floating too! What happened?"
"SpongeBob","  These weird bubbles saved us."
"Patrick","  It's all purple and sticky."
"SpongeBob","  And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble."
"Patrick","  Well, the smell makes my nose tickle.  Hey, it bounces! "
"Patrick"," Sorry! "
"Plankton"," Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm,  beach-goers should be famished  and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people!  Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! "
"Squidward","  Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this. "
"Plankton"," I could think of a few."
"Squidward","  Hey, you're blocking my light.  SpongeBob. "
"Plankton"," Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places.  Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?"
"Squidward","  I don't know and I don't care!  Hold it!  What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool  goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon. "
"Sandy"," Stop!  Those bubbles are dangerous!"
"Plankton"," Dangerous?"
"SpongeBob","  Fascinating. Tell us more."
"Patrick"," Yeah, but with visual aids."
"Sandy"," O-kay...  ""BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR"" . The visual is of a normal undersea background] My scientific investigation has  revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo.  A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable. At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!"
"Plankton"," That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. "
"SpongeBob"," It's so gooey. "
"Patrick","  I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like liquorice."
"Squidward","  You idiots!  That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?"
"Patrick","  No, not really. I drifted off."
"SpongeBob"," But just look at all the cool stuff it can do.  You can make a hat.  Or a beard."
"Patrick","  Or an awesome toupée."
"Squidward"," Toupée? You mean hair?  How do I look?"
"Sandy"," What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!"
"Patrick","  Seems safe to me."
"Sandy"," That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!"
"SpongeBob"," See you later, Sandy."
"Patrick"," Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves. "
"Sandy"," You have been warned! "
"SpongeBob"," Why not try a goo bubble? "
"Squidward"," Thanks, goo!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm on TV!"
"Patrick","  It's awesome."
"Sandy"," I have a comment Super Goo is evil!  Stay in your homes!"
"Plankton","  I can't find this thing anywhere.  Come on, now. Think, Plankton.  If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? "
"Plankton"," That's great, sweetheart."
"Plankton"," All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled, Insignificant Things My Wife Told Me."
"Plankton"," What did you say?"
"Plankton"," That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship.  Yes!  Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power.  With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense.  Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath!  And now to get the ding-dang out of here! "
"SpongeBob"," Look!  Giant goo bubble! "
"Sandy"," See, I told ya!  Run for your lives!"
"Patrick"," Sandy's really getting out of hand. "
"Sandy"," Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, it's so big!"
"Sandy"," That there is a Texas-sized bubble!  First, we'll check its tensile strength.  Tight as a drum."
"Patrick","  Oh, I want to play the drum! "
"Sandy"," No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!"
"Patrick"," Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. "
"Sandy","  Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket.  Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer.  This is worse than I thought."
"SpongeBob"," Look, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands. "
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I have a better idea.  Hold out your hands. "
"Patrick"," Oh, they shine!"
"Sandy"," Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about.  That ain't good. "
"Sandy"," Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to--  --run like heck! "
"Patrick","  I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can! "
"SpongeBob","  Whoa! "
"Sandy"," Phew, that was a close one."
"Patrick"," Help, help! Help!  I'm out of toilet paper in here! "
"SpongeBob"," Look out!  Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more!  Gotcha!  I don't gotcha! Whoa! "
"Patrick"," Help! "
"SpongeBob"," Now what do we do?"
"Sandy"," We need to get to my submarine! Fast!  Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike!  Hop on, SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling.  I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut. "
"Patrick"," Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could stick around.  Glad. "
"Sandy","  Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!"
"Patrick"," Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob?  Don't worry. I'll never leave you.  Huh?  No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob!  Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy! "
"SpongeBob"," So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom."
"Sandy"," If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!"
"Sandy"," I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?"
"Sandy"," You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes!  Darn it!  Huh? What the--?"
"SpongeBob"," That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own."
"Sandy"," Or the mind of someone else. Look!  Plankton! I knew it!"
"Plankton"," Yeah, it's me."
"Sandy"," What are y'all up to this time?"
"Plankton"," Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!"
"SpongeBob","  Rude!"
"Plankton"," Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble.  Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go. "
"Sandy"," Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!"
"Plankton"," Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! "
"Sandy","  Oh, no, you don't!  Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now! "
"Plankton"," That's right, come to Papa."
"Sandy"," When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!"
"Patrick","  Hey again, SpongeBlob!"
"Sandy"," We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!"
"Plankton"," Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second--  No, you don't! "
"Sandy"," Retreat! Retreat!"
"Plankton"," Aw, don't go so soon.  I hope you brought your dancing shoes!  'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo! "
"Patrick","  Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, good thing. "
"Sandy"," Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub!  My sub!"
"SpongeBob"," There, there Sandy."
"Patrick"," Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!"
"SpongeBob"," Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!"
"Patrick"," Really?  Do I need deodorant?"
"SpongeBob"," No, but you're close. What we need is  liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!"
"Patrick","  Bubbles. That's your answer for everything. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you, come again!  Hey, who turned out the lights? "
"Plankton"," Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why in the world would I want to do that?"
"Plankton"," Cause if you don't,  I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom!  As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!"
"Plankton"," Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!"
"Plankton"," You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!"
"Plankton"," Eh, not again."
"SpongeBob"," Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! "
"Plankton","  Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes."
"Sandy"," Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount! "
"SpongeBob"," Here goes.  Geroni-blow!  Pretty slick, huh? Get him! "
"Plankton","  Uh-oh."
"Patrick","  Whoo!  Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser!  Whoo!  You're the man! Yay! "
"Plankton"," Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean.  Oh, no, he's coming back!"
"Sandy"," And he's headin' right for us! "
"Plankton"," That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But I don't wanna!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ok, I'll do it."
"Mr. Krabs","  Here. I hope you choke on it."
"Plankton","  I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine!  I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that dirty little double-timer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him."
"Plankton","  Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! ""Just one ingredient...""  Darn it, Krabs!  Ow. "
"Sandy","  Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, darlin', it's like this Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left?  Please have your money ready!  Thank you!  Right this way. "
"SpongeBob","  See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Instant interest""?! Well, that's practically giving money away!  SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough!  Money, here I co... Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'M IN MONEY HEAVEN!!! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Show me where the money lives! I'd bet you got a lot!  I'd like to see all of it! I'm a huge fan of money!  H-Hey! Get your hands off...   Anchovies..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Good day, madam! I would like to take a look at your safe, please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not again...  Scallops!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Good day, gentlemen!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hello,  young missy!"
"Mr. Krabs","  So far so good..."
"Mr. Krabs","  They haven't thrown me out yet..."
"Mr. Krabs","  It's all coming together now..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yes! I'll have that please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, of course!  Here's me prized penny deposit it into a new account!"
"Mr. Krabs","  WAIT!!!  Uh, what you're doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Can it...have one moment with me penny? Alone?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, penny...I'll miss... It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye.  It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gasp! This can't be true!  'Tis true! I landed in money nirvana!  Me wildest dreams finally come true! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Do you want me to... Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? MR. KRABS!"
"Squidward"," Would you pipe down!?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned..."
"Squidward"," That's nice...and...interesting..."
"SpongeBob"," I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him!  Hold on, Krabs! I'm coming for ya!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, time to head home!  Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside!  Balmy! I'm locked in!  I guess I'm trapped here all night!  With all of this moolah! Such much moolah...  I have no one to tell about it! Time to russel up me some friends!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?"
"SpongeBob"," Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this but Mr. Krabs is missing!"
"SpongeBob"," I know!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry! I'll find him!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter!   Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight?  The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not giving him a tip.  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's nice."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, and she's made entirely out of money."
"SpongeBob"," What? Where are you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind."
"SpongeBob"," I gotta save Mr. Krabs!  Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! ]"
"Patrick"," What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank?  Has to be the coolest!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah. This is the life.  Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh. Heh heh. So hungry."
"SpongeBob","  Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?"
"Patrick"," Okay. First we climb up the walls.  Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall."
"Patrick"," Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this? "
"SpongeBob"," A bunch of old shoelaces?"
"Patrick"," It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes."
"SpongeBob"," I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! "
"SpongeBob"," This vent will surely lead us to Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," Let's get him!  COOL! Let's do that again!"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ohhh! So hungry!  Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done?  Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback.  You're okay! I was so worried.  What's this?!! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?!!  A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight!  Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, you ready?"
"Patrick"," This lock won't know what hit it! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse."
"Patrick"," Oh, right!  I'll use the finesse. "
"Patrick"," We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mister Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I got you now, money sucker! That does it, Lizard-breath! It's you and me now! Just you and me!  I concurred the money dragon! Victory! Woo hoo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?"
"SpongeBob"," That you can't put a price on freedom?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit!  Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest!  Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi Squidward! Bet you can't guess what movie we're gonna see!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," That's okay. I'll tell you."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," It's Fisher..."
"Squidward","  Ah. You may speak."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick and I are gonna see Fisherman 4! "
"Squidward"," Ha! You two won't sleep a wink tonight if you see that movie."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Nothing can scare us."
"Squidward","  Boo."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie. "
"Patrick"," We're lost."
"SpongeBob"," I wish we had a flashlight. "
"SpongeBob"," Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry.  So, this isn't too scary.  The Fisherman's hook! Get off the teeter-totter!"
"Patrick"," You fools! "
"SpongeBob"," The Fisherman's got him!"
"Patrick"," And he'll fry them into fish sticks! I can't watch! Is the scary part over?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, hold on, I'll take a peek. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's okay."
"Patrick"," You sure?  It's worse!  They're kissing!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry! "
"Patrick"," See if it's safe. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, the movie's over. "
"Patrick"," Oh, dang. We hardly even saw it."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through.  Okay. Keep your eyes open."
"Patrick"," No problem."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open."
"Patrick"," I'm on it. "
"SpongeBob"," D'ohhhh! "
"SpongeBob"," Must close eyes! Too scary!"
"Patrick"," I can't hold your eyelids—they're too slippery!  Ow! "
"SpongeBob","   Oh, no, we missed the movie."
"Patrick"," What?! Not again!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, we'll just see the next one."
"SpongeBob"," Wow. Uh, what time is it?"
"SpongeBob"," One... minute... to midnight?! "
"Patrick"," But that's when the Fisherman comes out! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!"
"SpongeBob"," Phew. We made it."
"Patrick"," I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact."
"Patrick"," It's like we're heroes."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Patrick"," Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?"
"SpongeBob"," No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. "
"Patrick"," Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead?  Do you hear that?"
"SpongeBob","  I think it's coming from over there.  "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there.  Just a few steps that away.  In the dark? All alone?"
"Patrick"," Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?"
"Patrick"," Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.  "
"Squidward"," What is wrong with you?! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Squidward."
"Squidward"," What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!"
"Patrick"," We can't get home."
"SpongeBob"," We're too scared. "
"SpongeBob","  Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend. "
"Patrick"," Thanks, Squidwar... "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you."
"Squidward"," Hat."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. Here. "
"Squidward"," I told those muttonheads not to see that movie. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Are you okay?"
"Patrick"," Yeah! Are you okay?"
"SpongeBob"," I think so! Goodnight!"
"Patrick"," Yeah., goodnight! Just don't think about the Fisherman!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!"
"Squidward"," Oh, ""The Fisherman."" ""The Fisherman."" Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how!  No.  No.  Um... no.  Aha!  It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman.  This is gonna be good. "
"Patrick"," Uh, hello? Someone there?  Uh, uh? What's that?  There's something stuck...  Huh.  Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left.  Oh, yeah. All right. Right there. "
"Squidward"," Gotcha! "
"Patrick","  The Fisherman! "
"Squidward"," Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!"
"Patrick"," Oh.  There."
"SpongeBob"," Now who's here?"
"Patrick"," Uh, someone's here?"
"SpongeBob"," You just said."
"Patrick"," Oh. The Fisherman's here."
"SpongeBob"," The Fisherman!"
"Patrick"," The Fisherman!"
"Squidward"," Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I’m having too much fun.  Ha. It's almost too easy."
"SpongeBob"," Quick. Block the door."
"Squidward"," There's just no sport in it."
"SpongeBob","  Get everything?"
"Patrick"," What about this? "
"SpongeBob"," Not Gary. Think it'll hold?"
"Patrick"," I sure hope so. "
"Patrick"," Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away."
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah. Just like the movie. "
"Squidward"," I'm the Deadly Fisherman!"
"SpongeBob"," I guess this is the end, old buddy."
"Patrick"," I don't want to die in my underwear!"
"SpongeBob"," Here.  Die in mine."
"Patrick"," Hey. Good idea. Let's trade.  Here you go."
"SpongeBob"," And here you go.  Now where were we? Oh, yeah."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," That thing's eating Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, with 33. I need you to go long. You're going down, Fisherman!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window.  Okay! I think you got it!   There, there, no need to digest. We're only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. We don't have to be afraid of that old monster anymore."
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward","  How cheesy. Who would ever be frightened by that?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Squidward","  Hey! MoistBob DripPants, you mind?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward. I just never seen a séance before."
"Squidward"," Well, try to contain yourself. We have a customer."
"Squidward"," Charming colloquialism, but let's try something that's actually on the menu."
"SpongeBob"," Just leave it to me, old rusty one! Prepare for a... What the barnacles is a Rusty on Rye?  Let's see... R... R... R... Ramblin Ham, Red Herring, Rib Tickler, Rusty Penguin, Salty Steamer. Huh, guess I don't know how to make Rusty on Rye.  But I can certainly learn! Help me out, sir. Can you clue me in on what was on your beloved Rusty on Rye?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the big kurfuffle? Oh, it's you. Only what's on the menu, old-timer!"
"Squidward"," Hah hah hah. Well, that's a first for you. An unsatisfied customer."
"SpongeBob","  No!  Mr. Krabs! There was an unsatisfied customer! Why don't we serve the Rusty on Rye anymore?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Because we never did. That sandwich was on the menu of an old restaurant that lay here a long time ago! Twas' an old ramshackle shack called Rusty's Rib Eye, and the only one who ever knew how to make that sandwich was the owner, Rusty Rickets. However, old Rusty bought the farm 20 years ago."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope. You're not getting that recipe unless you're versed into talking with the unliving."
"SpongeBob"," I believe I've seen a program on this matter!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Err... Scram. This conversation's making me dizzy."
"SpongeBob"," I may be able to get that recipe after all. I just need to call in a favor.  Hi Patrick! SpongeBob here.  Yeah, the one with square pants. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, can you meet me after work? I need your help with something.  Your best friend SpongeBob SquarePants."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good night, kiddo."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, bossman. Patrick and I will lock up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine. But no eating me inventory."
"Patrick"," Okay."
"Mr. Krabs"," Or me furniture."
"Patrick"," What? Come on, bossman! If we can't eat anything, why are we here?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, simple, my five-pointed friend. Tonight, we shall make contact with the unliving!  By performing... a séance! "
"Patrick"," Then can we eat some furniture?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Patrick","  "
"SpongeBob"," As consort to the spirit world, I know commence this séance! I shall invoke the specter of Rusty Rickets by reading from The Sacred Text. ""Distilled vinegar, water, number one mustard seed, salt, tumeric, paprika, natural flavors."" I now summon the spirit of Rusty Rickets!  Know, too, that I beckon the spirit of Rusty's Rib-Eye!"
"SpongeBob","  Rusty's Rib Eye!"
"Patrick"," But where's Rusty?"
"SpongeBob"," Rusty Rickets!"
"Patrick"," A big ghost?! I thought we were- we were conjuring a rib roast! I'm outta here!  I'll get help buddy! Just get me away from this freak!"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, he means freak in the nicest possible way. Alright, enough of this hocus pocus hooey. Time to put in some work!  Say, uh, Rusty, how about spilling the beans for the old Rusty on Rye recipe?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, well that was... just gibberish. Hmm... I got it! How bout you write down the recipe for the classic #9? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh right. You're a ghost. Hmm... how about you just show me how to make one?"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Gee, Rusty. What a setup you got here. But where's all the sandwich bread, the condiments, the cold cuts?"
"SpongeBob"," A rye sandwich carved entirely out of driftwood? Mama mia!"
"SpongeBob"," Spackle, shellac."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you want me to try it?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay.  Hmm... smells industrial!  Ugh! Um... I'm sure it's an acquired taste. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! I didn't summon you guys!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh! It looks like were running low on shellac! I'll go get some more.  Boy, those guys can sure terrify."
"SpongeBob"," Alright guys, I hate to be a party pooper, but it's a little late for all this noise."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That is private property! Maybe you guys should leave!"
"SpongeBob"," Do I have to call--  Eww... ectoplasm."
"Mr. Krabs"," You better have a darn good reason for getting me outta bed! "
"Patrick"," That good enough for ya? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! Patrick! Help!"
"Patrick"," Sorry SpongeBob, but this is the part of the story where I run away again only this time I don't know where to run to, so I'm just gonna go circling around the building "
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks like a certain foolish sponge has been conversin' with the unliving! All right you floating nuisances! Time for the bossman to mop up!  Batter up! H'ya!  Yeah, and go back in which ye came! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs--"
"Mr. Krabs"," Never hold a séance boy-o... without me permission, because ghosts are like relatives. Once you let them in, they never leave! "
"SpongeBob"," Order up! Here's your #9 sir! "
"SpongeBob"," And everything was better! "
"Patrick"," "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Patties and less heavy breathing?"
"SpongeBob","  Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next. "
"Squidward"," Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness.  Tentacles crossed."
"SpongeBob","  Silly Squidward. I'm not going to-- "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's going on around here? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession...  ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... ""the cat""?"
"SpongeBob"," He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney.  And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat.  That's what he does he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality.  Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No."
"SpongeBob","  And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals?  Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, no."
"SpongeBob","  But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Never noticed it. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh. You haven't seen him in your wallet?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hundreds, you say?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe even a thousand! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?"
"SpongeBob"," I shall do my Krustiest, sir. "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet? "
"SpongeBob","  Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok. "
"Sandy","  Well, if you ain't going to use your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?"
"Sandy","  Cat?!  In what way am I kind of like a cat?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?"
"Sandy"," We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time."
"Sandy","  I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me! "
"SpongeBob"," Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could ""someone"" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day."
"SpongeBob"," You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe."
"Patrick"," Wow!  Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to--  Oh! Oh, oh, oh... Oh, there you are, pocket taco. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?"
"Patrick"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. "
"Patrick","  Uh... Nope, I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me!  Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny!  Perfect!  We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!"
"Patrick","  This, uh, is getting creepy."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, buddy. Check it out."
"Patrick","  Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird."
"SpongeBob"," But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo. "
"Patrick"," Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is.  1000! Kenny Time! "
"SpongeBob","  Kenny!"
"SpongeBob"," Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.  Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign!  Swoon! Swoon! "
"Mr. Krabs"," One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's.  And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars.  Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host.  Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. the Cat? Everything OK?  Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! ""A clean cat is a moneymaking cat,"" I always say. Please  yourself of the lounge facilities. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'd best get back manning the grill."
"SpongeBob","  Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to…  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!"
"SpongeBob"," There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore.  Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you?  You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get...  depressed."
"SpongeBob"," All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, really. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, the cat of the hour is back!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear."
"SpongeBob","  ""You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem.""  ""You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat""?"
"Sandy"," Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature?  Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here."
"Sandy"," Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? "
"SpongeBob","  Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy."
"Sandy"," I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic,  considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?"
"Sandy","  What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin,  followed by eventual unconsciousness."
"Sandy"," I knew Kenny was a fake! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Come back!  Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special."
"Sandy"," Just get out of here already.  You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What is your problem?"
"Mr. Krabs"," My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!"
"Squidward"," Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tentacles, I mean it!  You get back to mindin' that register!"
"Squidward"," Minding it for  which customer?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob's got that covered."
"SpongeBob","  Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!"
"Squidward"," I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!"
"SpongeBob"," Already done, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep-- "
"SpongeBob"," Done and dusted! "
"Squidward"," Nice working conditions, but, no thanks! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!"
"Squidward"," Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes."
"SpongeBob","  Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!"
"Squidward"," Sorry, all out of polish."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'm not!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another."
"Squidward"," It doesn't matter what you ""want"" me to do, I won't do it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible."
"SpongeBob","  Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab."
"SpongeBob","  The Yeti Krab?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You will be eaten!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward and I are as close as brothers!"
"Squidward"," Ludicrous."
"Mr. Krabs"," You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or..."
"SpongeBob"," Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Precisely. See ya, boys! "
"Squidward"," Whatever. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!"
"Squidward","  You sure it's not these you're smelling?"
"SpongeBob"," If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!"
"Squidward"," Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!"
"Squidward"," You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay. "
"SpongeBob","  Good day, sir. Are you Yeti to order?  Oh, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What? What? What? Wha... huh?"
"SpongeBob"," You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!"
"Squidward","  Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?"
"SpongeBob"," Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!"
"Squidward","  Oh, yes I am."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!"
"Squidward","  I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?"
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!"
"Squidward","  Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!"
"SpongeBob"," Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant! "
"Squidward"," Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say! "
"Squidward","  Guess I'm down to the comic section. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!! "
"Squidward"," That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witless, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too! "
"SpongeBob","  T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs! "
"Squidward","  Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm back, fellas!"
"Squidward","  Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What? "
"Mr. Krabs"," We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Guys, do you hear that?"
"Squidward"," You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp? "
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idol? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Done! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Refinish me floors!"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Done!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Build me a new safe!"
"Squidward"," Nuh-uh."
"SpongeBob"," Consider it done!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh-wah!  where the real SpongeBob is reconstructed with his spatula in his hand.] Oh! "
"Squidward"," Hmm? Who's that? "
"SpongeBob","  Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr.-  what?"
"Squidward"," Fired?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you see, I've been doin' some calculatin' and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely."
"SpongeBob","  But how about if I work for free?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's  ""illegal"". And I'll lose my ""vendor's license"". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Maybe.  Take it."
"Mr. Krabs","  You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel."
"SpongeBob"," But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but."
"Squidward"," Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority."
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned.  Here's your pink slip.  I'm giving you the ax.  You're fired."
"SpongeBob","  No! Not that! Anything but that! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that. "
"SpongeBob"," Here, I'll get that for you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll also need the hat. Allow me.  Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need. "
"Squidward","  Okay, that's enough. It's closing time.  You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime...  As a customer.  Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance.  Man, is it gonna be sweet without that pest around!  This day couldn't get any better.  Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times ""golden spatula"" in the navy,  so I'll be runnin' the grill.  Ooh!"
"Squidward"," I can smell the grease fires already."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Gary, I'm home. "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore."
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime.  I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom.  Now I just feed you.  Oh, thanks, Gary."
"SpongeBob","  That's how I used to hold my spatula.  Patrick, what's wrong?"
"Patrick","  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad. "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?"
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f..."
"Patrick"," Free French fries?"
"SpongeBob"," F-f-f-f-f-f-f..."
"Patrick"," Fried Frittatas?"
"SpongeBob"," F-f-f-f-f-f-f..."
"Patrick"," Frothy frappe?"
"SpongeBob"," F-f-f-f..."
"Patrick"," I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter ""c"", SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," It's not food, Patrick. I got fired."
"Patrick"," Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know!  I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay."
"Patrick","  Great. See you then. "
"Patrick","  Oh!  Hey, buddy! Are you ready? Ready for your first day of glorious unemployment? Or as I like to call it, ""fun-employment""! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, sure.  Whatever."
"Patrick"," That's the spirit!  Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward.  Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning? "
"Squidward","  How many times do I have to tell you... Keep..  Off...  My... ... Petunias?!"
"Patrick","  I'll just save this for later.  Now you try."
"SpongeBob","  Uh...  Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed! "
"Patrick"," Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick","  Are you feelin' any better yet?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh-uh."
"Patrick"," Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up? "
"SpongeBob","  Nope."
"Patrick"," Free lunch with friends!"
"SpongeBob","  Yippee."
"Sandy"," Okay, let's begin the experiment.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, next."
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, lunch! "
"Sandy"," Very interesting.  Okay, next.  SpongeBob! I almost didn't recognize you.  You look awful! What are you doin' with these here freeloaders?"
"SpongeBob"," I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed.  Whoo-hoo. "
"Sandy"," Whoa, there. You do not want to eat that."
"SpongeBob"," Why? What is it?"
"Sandy"," Heck if I know.  this here's a psychological test to see how much weird gunk folks will eat... if it's free.  Who's for seconds?"
"Patrick","  Here ya go, little buddy.  Ahh. Mmm!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart.  Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life.  What you need is a new job."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job."
"Patrick"," Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that! "
"Patrick"," Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick.  It's time to rejoin the workforce. Gainful employment, here I come!  Yah! I'm ready! Whoo-hoo!  ♪I'm ready, I'm ready for a new job, for a new job, I'm ready for a new job; I'm ready♪ "
"SpongeBob","  Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm.  This grill is not in very good shape."
"SpongeBob","  Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is.  Aha! "
"SpongeBob"," Your weenies, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," They're weenie patties."
"SpongeBob"," Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?"
"SpongeBob"," I mean, Mr. Wiener!"
"SpongeBob","  Well that was a setback.  Hello, Pizza Piehole!"
"SpongeBob","  Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man.  You need a fry-cook? "
"SpongeBob","  Eh... probably. "
"SpongeBob"," Cool.  Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... Perhaps I'll find contentment."
"SpongeBob"," Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, of deliciousness!"
"SpongeBob"," But who'll make the Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob","  Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off.  Hey, taco man, may I have a job, por favour?"
"SpongeBob","  How about that?"
"SpongeBob","  But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Aah! "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home."
"SpongeBob","  For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day.  Who are you gonna cook for now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Gary, you must be starving.  Don't worry gare-bear.  I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you.  Oh, no.  We're all out of Snailpo.  We'll just have to make our own.  Perfect! "
"SpongeBob","  One homemade can of Snailpo! "
"SpongeBob","  What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?"
"Patrick","  Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?"
"SpongeBob","  Only satisfaction.  If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do.  I mean three.  Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Weenie?"
"SpongeBob"," But you just fired me."
"SpongeBob","  I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?"
"SpongeBob"," Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill,  and he really seems to be relishing it."
"SpongeBob"," Pizza sauce?  I'm free!"
"SpongeBob"," What?  Parmesan-crusted breadstick!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, thank you, Señor Taco!  Oh, no! Not you too! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  Krabby Patty! You saved me!  Well, here we go again."
"Mr. Krabs","  Wait! Come back!  That was me last customer.  SpongeBob?  Squidward, you found him!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward?"
"Squidward","  I'm afraid so.  SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," You know I hate you, right?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes.  Yes, I do."
"Squidward"," Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more.  Please come back and be the fry cook again. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, laddy.  I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy."
"SpongeBob","  All right! Now my life has purpose again!  Let's get this place cleaned up. "
"Squidward"," Hmm.  Not exactly my color."
"SpongeBob","  The Krusty Krab is back in business!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet. "
"Squidward","  20 minutes in the bath seems like enough.   Another day!  Another day."
"SpongeBob","  Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I...   Not ready for work! "
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"SpongeBob","  Thanks for waiting, Squidward."
"Squidward"," I wasn't waiting."
"SpongeBob","  I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants."
"Squidward"," Yes, I saw that."
"SpongeBob"," I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?"
"Squidward"," Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!"
"SpongeBob"," I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!   Squidward, what are you doing?! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, look.  We're walking in a straight line."
"SpongeBob"," I don't follow."
"Squidward"," A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!"
"SpongeBob"," Speak English, brainiac! "
"Squidward"," Well, see, you have point A , where you start, and then there's point...  point... I don't even know what I'm talking about!"
"SpongeBob","  Mmm, strawberry!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work!  Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!"
"Squidward"," Oh, for the last time  straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!"
"SpongeBob"," There is always a shortcut!"
"Squidward"," What moron told you that?"
"Patrick","  There's always a shortcut!"
"Squidward"," Huh."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!"
"Squidward"," Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yoo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob","  You're not going to come with me?"
"Squidward"," No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there!  That's the face! That's the look!    First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut!  Huh?"
"Squidward"," Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged!  First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut!  There, that's better.   Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! "
"Sandy","  First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!"
"SpongeBob"," Local landmarks...  A-ha!  Right at this large and unusual shell.  Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant.  There it is, the Krusty Krab! "
"Squidward"," Ahhhh.... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, look at this. Lazing about.  Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?"
"Squidward"," No thanks, I got one!  Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause."
"SpongeBob","  The Krabby Krust?!  Is that the name of a restaurant?"
"SpongeBob"," Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom!  Here, take this coupons!"
"SpongeBob"," I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now?  "
"Sandy","  Remember, your landmarks!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money!  Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came...  I'M LOST!  Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant!  Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant!  So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out.  Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone.  Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it.  My last dime.  I hope this works. "
"Squidward"," Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?"
"SpongeBob"," It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone."
"Squidward"," You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?"
"SpongeBob"," Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, hold on! . He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels] Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!"
"SpongeBob"," What ya doing there, drinking soda?"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, you drive a pedicab?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! "
"SpongeBob","  Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school!  Krusty Klam?!  Wait, Scott, come back!  TARTER SAUCE!!! "
"SpongeBob"," No! Over the cliff!  Through the toxic runoff!  Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe!  Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire!  Up this massive hill!  That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early!  I made it! I made it!  Oh, random Krusty Krab patrients! How I've missed out!  Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces!  I missed the bathroom, too!   But most of all, I missed you, choking guy!   Patrick? How did you get here?"
"Patrick"," Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?! "
"Squidward"," Congratulations. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that!  You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! "
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir!"
"Squidward"," What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!"
"Squidward"," I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin!  Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There you go!  Now get to work! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh no! It says ""Buy one for a fee!"""
"Mr. Krabs","   And how is everything for you today, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine, fine."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, okay, always nice to hear. "
"Mr. Krabs","  You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Argh!  Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?! "
"Squidward"," I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors...  ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!"
"Squidward"," What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offence."
"Squidward"," None taken."
"Mr. Krabs"," Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it. "
"Squidward"," Let me grab a pencil.  Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha."
"Mr. Krabs","  Avast there, lad!  You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  Oh, I can't even cry right! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!"
"Mr. Krabs"," How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, about $100 a semester."
"Mr. Krabs"," $100 a semester?!  Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!"
"SpongeBob","  Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a...  ""professional"" to teach you how to drive."
"SpongeBob"," You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket."
"SpongeBob","  It is?"
"Mr. Krabs","  And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time."
"SpongeBob"," It does?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, but you got the right fire in your belly."
"SpongeBob"," I do?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue."
"Mr. Krabs"," This empty parking lot is just the ticket.  Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you're so wise."
"Mr. Krabs","  Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear!  Hmm."
"SpongeBob"," Rookie mistake, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage."
"SpongeBob"," Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand.  Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh.   All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face.  Bleah! Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'll say."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just take a look around, boy-o home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night.  Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple a little trip down the street to Patrick's house. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick's house! "
"Squidward"," Okay."
"Mr. Krabs","  Upsell!"
"Squidward","   Would you like fries with that?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Better."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, ""Put 'er into gear."" "
"Squidward"," You missed one. "
"Mr. Krabs","  A simple trip to Patrick's house a line so straight and true."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat.  Or can ye?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now hand me one of them tokens.  You'll need your protective headgear. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat!  Uh-oh. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great job, boy. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Saw that coming."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... ]"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?"
"SpongeBob"," You never!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. "
"SpongeBob","  Snapping!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my gosh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!"
"SpongeBob","  Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go!  Atta boy!  There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, yeah, some of it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Buck up, me boy-o.  It's your turn next."
"SpongeBob","  My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me."
"Mr. Krabs","  Not really."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is."
"Mr. Krabs","  You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example a colorful example.  I was teaching the lad to drive."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel."
"SpongeBob"," Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Quiet, boy! Let me handle this."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together."
"Mr. Krabs","  This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa! My first real traffic ticket."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! What could be worse than spending money? "
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes."
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha doing?"
"Squidward"," I'm busy."
"SpongeBob"," How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?"
"Squidward","  Fourteen!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!"
"Squidward","  It is!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?"
"Squidward"," What's ""busy busy?"""
"Squidward"," No no no no no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!"
"SpongeBob","  I found a jump rope!"
"Squidward","  I said not to tell me!  You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Who's the lucky..."
"Squidward","  Perfectly brown toast points.   Sparkling kelp juice.   Here's to me!  D'oh! That simpering buffoon!"
"Squidward"," I know."
"Squidward","  Go away!"
"Squidward"," Wait. I thought you were some other idiot."
"Squidward"," ""You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season The opening of Galleria Diphtheria."" Oh, I've heard of that! ""Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--""  ""--Squidward Tentacles...""  ""...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"""
"Squidward"," Ahh! What are you still doing here?"
"Squidward"," Plus one! Oh yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?"
"Squidward"," Do you have to do it?"
"Squidward"," What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?"
"SpongeBob","  Somebody like me?"
"SpongeBob"," I like openings."
"Squidward"," No, not like you!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me."
"Squidward"," Let's see here. Friends... "
"Squidward","  Friends, friends..."
"Squidward"," Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  TONIGHT?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?"
"Squidward"," But, of course! It's so simple."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I have something to ask you."
"SpongeBob"," Of course I'll go to the opening with you!"
"Squidward"," That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went..."
"Squidward"," Hey, there you are!"
"Squidward"," What? What are you... Oh!  You always were a big kidder, huh?  Mailman  guy?"
"Squidward"," I love introverts! Why I'm an introvert!"
"Squidward"," Say, I bet we have a lot in common."
"Squidward"," That's me!"
"Squidward"," Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can..."
"Squidward"," Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, I know it... What?"
"Squidward"," Oh, you think you know a guy?  Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend."
"SpongeBob","  I'll be your friend."
"Squidward","  Who is this?"
"SpongeBob"," It's me, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes? I'm still here."
"Squidward"," I need to ask you something important."
"SpongeBob"," You don't have to ask me three times."
"Squidward"," Will you tell Larry I wanna talk to him?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Okey-doke."
"Squidward"," Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words."
"Squidward"," You have?"
"Squidward"," Um, no. The.. They always seemed a little sporty for me."
"Squidward"," What the heck?"
"Squidward"," We make quite a team!"
"Squidward"," You know, earlier today I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music."
"Squidward"," You know, you're alright, Lester."
"Squidward"," Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?"
"Squidward"," What?! You don't need that glop!"
"Squidward"," Oh, come on. It's a fat. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. ""I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."""
"Squidward","  I mean..."
"Squidward"," So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?"
"Squidward","  I guess it's just you and me again."
"Squidward","  What are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob","  Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you like this. Wanna play?"
"Squidward"," Just get me out of here!"
"SpongeBob","  Will do."
"Squidward"," Thanks."
"SpongeBob"," Anything for a friend."
"Squidward"," Friend?"
"Squidward"," Would you be my plus one?"
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Aww!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, hold on a second there free-loader! What are you doing here?"
"Patrick"," I'm here for lunch."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you bring money this time?"
"Patrick","  Yes! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see that.  Alright. Pay is real. Now get in line!"
"Patrick","  Yes, sir! "
"Patrick","  Mmm, Quadrants!"
"Patrick","  These guys talk funny words."
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?"
"Patrick"," I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about."
"Squidward"," Ah, the executive treatment."
"Patrick"," Is that what you call it?"
"Squidward"," Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it."
"Patrick"," Oh, wow! I'll take seven!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry."
"Patrick"," But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the ""Donut"" and it was great! The donut is gone!  The donut is gone!"
"Squidward","  First of all a lot of that donut, it's still on your face! "
"Patrick"," Now, where's my executive treatment?"
"Squidward"," I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you  the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars."
"Patrick"," Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?"
"Squidward"," Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of  business glasses for additional 10 dollars."
"Patrick","  Well, I'd be stupid not to!"
"Squidward"," Well, you're half right."
"Patrick"," Here's your 20 bucks. "
"Squidward"," Here's your glasses. "
"Patrick"," Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment my good man. "
"SpongeBob"," Here's your executive treatment!"
"Squidward","  Here you go."
"Patrick"," Oh man!  It looks executively delicious! "
"Patrick"," But! But!  Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!"
"Squidward","  I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!"
"Patrick"," No!  No!!!  No!!!  Not 4-B!!! NO!!!!!"
"Patrick"," He’d be given a sandwich and sent on his way?"
"Patrick"," I think I’ve forgot to water my manatee I'll just--? "
"Patrick","  Where am I?"
"Patrick"," A sandwich? "
"Patrick","  No I don’t! "
"Patrick"," What if I had a meaningless chart?"
"Patrick"," Oh, wait!  And here’s a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean?  I guess he likes my chart, 'cause he’s smiling."
"Patrick"," Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?"
"Patrick"," Oh."
"Patrick"," Well, uh, let’s see. Uh, don’t tell me! I-I know it’s not sandwiches. They don’t get sandwiches. Do they?"
"Patrick","  And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report. "
"Patrick"," You do? "
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you.  You can’t fire me! I’m not an executive at all! I’m just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say! "
"Patrick"," Who is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I heard you’re in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. That’s nice."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Well, it’s pretty nice I guess."
"SpongeBob"," You know what that makes you?"
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh."
"SpongeBob","  An executive!"
"Patrick"," Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh! An executive treatment! "
"Patrick"," Let’s go home, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, but who are you?  No seriously. Who are you?"
"Squidward"," Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is..."
"Squidward","  PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," I smell something burning."
"Squidward"," Yeah. Probably my eye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, stop your drama, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You missed a spot."
"Mr. Krabs"," What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive."
"SpongeBob"," Like what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!"
"SpongeBob"," At this point it would be ketchuping up the water."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe Pete is just tired."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-"
"Mr. Krabs","  No! Not his productivity!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Company picnic?"
"SpongeBob"," See, look! He's already perking up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?"
"SpongeBob"," Definitely!"
"Squidward","  What's going on in here?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!"
"Plankton"," A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea."
"Squidward"," This is the greatest company picnic ever?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes it is."
"SpongeBob"," Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started."
"Squidward"," Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses."
"SpongeBob"," Here's one!"
"Squidward"," Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Right you are! Here's the food! "
"Squidward","  What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around."
"Mr. Krabs"," Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Going long!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ho, ho. This is so much fun."
"SpongeBob"," Is this far enough?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere."
"Squidward"," I'm going home."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, ""This was the greatest..."""
"Squidward"," Do not say it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," ""The greatest comp..."""
"Squidward"," Don't!"
"Mr. Krabs","  ""The greatest company picnic ever!"""
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, looks like we've got company."
"SpongeBob"," Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic. "
"Squidward"," Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil."
"Mr. Krabs","  I have? Wait. Oh yeah."
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Chumpany Picnic""? That's not how you spell ""Company Picnic""!"
"Plankton","  Guess who?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?"
"Plankton"," Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!"
"Plankton"," Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day."
"SpongeBob","  Aww!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You don't even have any employees!"
"SpongeBob","  Aww!"
"Plankton"," Sure I do."
"Plankton"," Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around."
"SpongeBob"," A real disk?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!"
"SpongeBob"," Well. Eh."
"Plankton"," You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?"
"Plankton"," Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities."
"Plankton"," The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies..."
"Squidward"," Delicacies?"
"Plankton"," And of course, the dunking booth!"
"Plankton","  Have you seen the calliope?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display..."
"Squidward"," One side, Goopy!"
"SpongeBob"," Yum."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either."
"Plankton"," You were saying, Krabs? "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?"
"SpongeBob"," Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure."
"Squidward","  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob","  You want me to paint your face?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't know."
"SpongeBob"," Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?"
"SpongeBob"," No. Course not."
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure you don't want to?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You sure?"
"SpongeBob"," 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You can never have too many!"
"Squidward"," Whoo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Squiddie-bird!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!"
"SpongeBob"," It's a paper plate. Whoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me."
"Squidward"," I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees..."
"Plankton"," Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh!  Me first! Me first!"
"Plankton"," Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's such great advice!"
"Plankton"," This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more! "
"SpongeBob"," Ahem! Hello, Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Uh oh."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," My candied pen!"
"SpongeBob","  Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!"
"SpongeBob","  No!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means..."
"Squidward"," I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whew! That was a cl..."
"Mr. Krabs"," You saved me, boy. How did you do it?"
"SpongeBob"," I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton"," Unbelievable!"
"Plankton"," Uh oh."
"SpongeBob","  The greatest company picnic ever!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope. Nothing.  I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early.  Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal."
"Squidward"," You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?"
"Mr. Krabs"," When he goes, you can go. "
"Squidward"," Grr!  Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you.  What? No tip? Finally! Yes!  Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening!  Cause it's not."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days."
"SpongeBob"," Old navy days?! Ohh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past.  There, now. The lights are properly dimmed.  Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies  as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest."
"Squidward"," I don't want any hair on my chest."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I do! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling!  And me ship was being tossed about,  like a rag doll on a trampoline!  I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall!  It was just then that he bursts into the galley!"
"SpongeBob"," Who he?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare!  The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman!  They called him,  Captain Scarfish!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," But that's... That's madness! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But I don't know how!"
"Squidward"," Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion?  What SPF? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  Chafed, Mr. Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Chafed! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye-aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye-aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, don't ""huzzah"" yet, boys."
"Mr. Krabs"," Slop. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, sorry boys.  Captain's orders.  Oh, I can't stand it!  I don't care what the captain says! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Cherries jubilee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, flaming cherries jubilee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and...  And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move.  The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare! "
"Mr. Krabs"," But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise. "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball."
"Mr. Krabs"," I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say.  I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention.  He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wise lad.  And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off.  And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom.  But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me.  Pirates! We were under attack!  I had to act fast!  Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations!  I was on me own.  I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates!  And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn!  The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?"
"Mr. Krabs","  That's it!  Come with me, lad!  Direct hit!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain!  Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo!  Close one! Ha-ha! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me!  Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade!  Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar! "
"Squidward"," What are we all winking about?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know! "
"SpongeBob","  Ah, I tell you Gary, there is nothing better on a sunny day than a fresh walk."
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, pal? Walking too fast for ya?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? What is it, boy? Is someone in danger?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww. Come here, little fella. I won't hurt ya."
"SpongeBob"," Aww. I'm gonna called you, Señor Poopus. Good job, Gary. Let's get him home so he can eat. He's almost all shell."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, Señor Poopus sure is hungry."
"SpongeBob"," Aww. He wants to play."
"Patrick"," Ha. Whatcha doing, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary found this stray snail and I'm nursing him back to health."
"Patrick"," Huh. Well, what about those baby snails?"
"Patrick"," They're over here."
"SpongeBob"," Aww. So tiny and hungry. They have nobody to take care of them. I'm gonna take 'em home and feed 'em."
"Patrick"," Feed 'em to who?"
"SpongeBob"," It is important to keep baby snails warm at all times."
"Patrick"," My mouth is warm."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, good suggestion, Patrick. But I got this."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," There we go."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. Perfect temperature. Time to eat my little snaily poos."
"SpongeBob"," Eat up, you little cuties."
"Patrick"," So... I guess I'll be going then."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? What? Did you guys lose your bottle?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! You must be the snail mom."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! This guy found this snail in his garden and he didn't know what to do. So, I told him how you take care of snails."
"Patrick"," That's a pretty good thing I thought of. Huh? Well..."
"SpongeBob"," I'll call you..."
"SpongeBob"," Donnie."
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Uh, excuse me. Pardon me. Uh, just a minute!"
"SpongeBob"," Three bags of snail chow. Four bags of snail litter."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, you're welcome?"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Donnie, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting."
"SpongeBob"," Geez, my pants are getting ruined and my head is sticky. I gotta do something about that."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?"
"Squidward"," I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food."
"Mr. Krabs","  What?! Where's SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," Let me think. No idea."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!"
"Squidward"," I can't do that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a eye poppin' south sea hula gal?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. But I'm so busy taking care of these snails. I'll try to come in tomorrow."
"Mr. Krabs"," You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...!"
"SpongeBob"," Down, Vince! You leave Electric Ronnie alone! Mr. Buster, get off that shelf! Nothing today, thank you! Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward","  I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's. "
"Squidward"," What the?  Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies."
"Squidward"," Hey, lady!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, is that you?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. "
"Squidward"," What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry. I'm taking very good care of all my snails. "
"Squidward"," I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!"
"SpongeBob"," Even Gary? "
"Squidward"," One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Let's count them shall we. One, two, three, Mary, Donnie, Carmela, Señor Poopus, Jack, twenty-four, Paul, Brenda, Cheryl, Steve, One that keeps barfing on the floor, forty-eight,  Obulax, Vince, Mavis, Mavis Jr. Electric Ronnie, Dianne, Pam, Ninety-seven, Walter, Sarah, Bugaloo Shrimp,  a hundred forty-one, Viva, Tom, Thea, Ava, that's a hundred sixty-four, Old Ironsides, , Rhonda, Papa Pup, He Who Shall Not Be Named, two hundred thirty-three, Sean, Andy, Mr. Buster, Mrs. Buster, I'll say two hundred fifty-eight!"
"Squidward","  Enough! You have to get rid of those snails and get back to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Work? But I've found my life's work. Taking care of wayward snails. "
"Squidward","  That's it!! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!"
"Squidward"," He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes!  Oh, my allergies are killing me."
"Squidward"," Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy."
"Squidward"," That's it. I'm done."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!"
"Squidward","  Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right."
"Patrick"," Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get."
"Patrick"," Meow."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, another little stray friend. What is your name little fellow?"
"Patrick"," It's Patrick! Um, Meow!"
"SpongeBob"," I think I'll call you Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, you dirty boy. You need a bath."
"Patrick"," Meow, no! No, meow!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, hello, police."
"SpongeBob","  No, thank you, please.  Oh no, Patrick. No outsidies for you. "
"Patrick"," Meow, help! Meow, help! "
"Squidward"," He said, ""No, thank you, please""? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!"
"Squidward"," Oh, this has got to stop!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, the bad men want to take you away from me. But I won't let them."
"SpongeBob","  Sanctuary! Sanctuary!  Everybody in! Everybody in!"
"Squidward","  Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello."
"SpongeBob"," Hello."
"SpongeBob"," Esmerelda?"
"SpongeBob","  Señor Poopus. "
"SpongeBob"," So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Señor Poopus.  I mean Señorita Esmerelda."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Bob. We will. But I'm going back to being a one snail guy. That's the way I like it."
"Patrick"," Bye, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! Patrick!  Don't worry! I'm going to adopt you!"
"SpongeBob"," Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?"
"Squidward","  A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left. Ha- Perfect!  Oww."
"SpongeBob","  Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!"
"Squidward"," No he doesn't!"
"SpongeBob"," But just look at him go!"
"Squidward"," This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year."
"SpongeBob"," Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, it's good as that. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators!. I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sure thing Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Oh, I wonder how many Krabby Patties I can sell!♪"
"Squidward"," Wonder no longer, you only need one."
"Mr. Krabs","  ♪!lles nac I seittaP ybbarK ynam woh rednow I ,ho♪ What do you mean one!"
"Squidward"," Didn't you see today's newspaper?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No takers for ""McNulty Challenge"". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?"
"Squidward"," He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win."
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey at least we have Founders Day!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty."
"Patrick"," I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry.  Squidward did you get a new haircut?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!"
"Patrick"," I isn't Patrick?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town."
"Patrick"," I like the first part but I don't understand the second part."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!"
"Patrick"," Ah! Oh no that's gonna hurt!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more."
"Patrick"," I like to eat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat."
"Patrick","  Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy."
"SpongeBob"," Tummies! Ha-ha-ha "
"Patrick"," I like whistles!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!"
"Patrick"," Gotta warm up my taste buds first. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Son, can you eat faster?"
"Patrick"," Oh, faster? "
"Patrick"," Oh, why didn't you say so. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth."
"Patrick","  I don't"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!"
"Patrick"," His homework?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing."
"SpongeBob"," His taxes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys,  That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on  You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!"
"Patrick"," I don't get to taste?"
"SpongeBob"," This feels wrong Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need  a hundred more patties."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, i'll get right on it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!"
"Patrick"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!"
"Patrick"," Hey."
"SpongeBob"," Who's ready!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this."
"SpongeBob"," Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand."
"Mr. Krabs","  I smell mutiny, what's going on here?"
"Patrick"," I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no problem, "
"Patrick"," What's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training. "
"Patrick"," But I didn't know I had to pay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son. "
"Patrick"," Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot."
"Mr. Krabs","  You made the right choice kid! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!"
"Patrick"," It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on."
"SpongeBob"," The taste, Patrick,  Remember the taste!"
"Patrick"," The taste. "
"Patrick"," No, this thing doesn't even fit! "
"Patrick"," I don't get it! What's an audit?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!"
"Patrick","  I am rolling the dice!  Now I am moving!  ""Run...Spreadsheets""?"
"SpongeBob"," What does that even mean?! "
"Patrick"," Well, maybe I'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, that sounds right to me!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward. Wanna play ""Certified Public Accountant"" with us?"
"Squidward"," Oh, let me think. That sounds so no!"
"Patrick"," I don't think this game is ripe."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon."
"Squidward","  What? Do you think that games grow on trees? "
"Patrick"," Doesn't everything grow on trees?"
"Squidward"," No, you ninny! Somebody makes them."
"Patrick"," Makes them?"
"Squidward"," Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game."
"Patrick"," Then I could make a game?"
"Squidward"," No, you couldn't. You would be incapable."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I think Patrick could make up a game."
"Squidward"," Your operative word there is think."
"Patrick"," Yeah! The opernive... word is think!  Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!"
"SpongeBob"," Go get'em, Patrick!"
"Squidward","  Double morons."
"Patrick"," I invented a game! I invented a game!"
"Squidward"," Whoopee. Do tell."
"Patrick"," Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?"
"Squidward"," Uh-huh."
"Patrick"," Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!"
"Squidward","  I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?"
"Patrick"," It's called...  ""Tic-Tac""! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh... "
"Squidward"," O?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, ""Tic-Tac""!.  You start!"
"Squidward"," Tic-Tac."
"Patrick"," Uh...  Best two out of four?"
"Squidward"," Tic and Tac."
"Patrick"," I should've gone with my first idea ""Tic""."
"Patrick"," Squidward, I got a new game! It's called ""Rock, Paper, Butter""!"
"Squidward"," Butterin' than the different game? "
"Patrick"," Squidward, I got it!  Whose rope is longer? You...  Aww! You played this before!"
"Patrick"," Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure."
"Sandy","  If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them.  Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. "
"Patrick","  I know what to do!"
"Patrick"," And so it begins."
"Patrick","  It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!"
"Squidward"," I don't see the point to this game night. Every game that Patrick has ""invented"" is more pointless and boring than the last."
"Sandy"," This time, he did research."
"Squidward"," Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored."
"Sandy"," Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!"
"SpongeBob"," This is gonna be written about it in the history book someday."
"Squidward"," Yeah. In crayon."
"Patrick"," Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium."
"Squidward"," More like a lamatourium. Ha."
"Patrick"," Welcome, gamers! And behold!  My game!"
"SpongeBob"," It's beautiful!"
"Squidward","  Are we finished? Who won? "
"Patrick","  No, my friend. We have only just begun."
"Sandy"," What's it called, Patrick?"
"Squidward"," Might I suggest ""garbage""?  What?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?"
"Patrick"," It's called... Patrick! The Game! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Squidward"," Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. "
"Patrick"," Alright!  I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be..."
"Squidward"," Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?"
"Patrick"," You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?"
"Squidward","  Both!"
"Patrick"," Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game."
"Squidward"," I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play."
"Patrick"," Hmm...  Okay!  Oh, money!! "
"Sandy"," Yee-haw! Beach broad property! "
"SpongeBob"," Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?"
"Patrick"," Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?"
"Squidward"," Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!"
"Squidward"," Uh-huh."
"Patrick"," You go to jail."
"Patrick"," My turn!  One... two..."
"Squidward"," Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished."
"Sandy"," Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!"
"SpongeBob"," Twelve. I'll... drive the car!"
"Patrick"," Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail."
"Squidward"," Well, what do I do to get out of jail?"
"Patrick"," You have to roll a six."
"Patrick"," Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, play by the rules."
"Squidward"," Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six! And I can't roll if I'm in jail! Just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!"
"Patrick","  Ah, here it is!  The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name."
"Squidward","  Fine. Someone say my name."
"Patrick"," Oh boy! You landed on ""Do a Surgery""!  Now, pick a surgery card."
"Sandy","  Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left."
"Squidward"," What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!"
"Sandy"," Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit."
"Sandy"," Got it."
"Patrick"," Now, sit back down, you criminal!"
"Squidward"," Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!"
"SpongeBob"," Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved."
"Squidward"," Well, neither have you."
"Squidward","  That's it! I've had enough!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward! Wait!"
"Sandy"," Don't go, Squidward!"
"Patrick"," No wait, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Wait, how'd he get out of jail?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward made us say his name."
"Sandy"," That was a smart move, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Huh? Oh. Hmm... "
"SpongeBob"," Now you roll after me."
"SpongeBob"," Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll..."
"Squidward"," Race the car."
"SpongeBob"," I'll..."
"Squidward"," Race the car!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll... race the car!"
"Squidward"," Oh boy! Snacks!"
"Patrick"," Jail for Squidward!"
"Squidward"," But I was on snacks!"
"Patrick"," Tell it to the judge!"
"Squidward"," Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!"
"Patrick"," Starving! Starving sea star time!"
"Squidward","  Okay, I'm going outside."
"Patrick","  If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside."
"Squidward"," But I didn't say ""outsidies"" I said..."
"Patrick"," Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!"
"Squidward"," Ha."
"SpongeBob"," Two.  Silly face! Silly face!"
"Sandy"," Now, that's a silly face!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means!  So, I could just roll the dice and say, ""Automatic Winner!"""
"SpongeBob"," Good job, Squidward! You've won!"
"Sandy"," Nice play, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play."
"Patrick"," Not so fast!  No player may declare himself ""Automatic Winner."""
"Squidward"," You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!"
"Squidward"," Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!"
"Squidward"," Somebody say my name!"
"Patrick"," Game over!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up crew, I have an announcement! Bikini Bottom's new sports stadium will officially be named after this restaurant!"
"SpongeBob"," ""The Krusty Krab Stadium."" Wow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Soon we'll have all the concessions in the stadium! Paying for the naming rights will make me millions!"
"SpongeBob","  Opening day is today! Tailgate party! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Not for you! Your tails have to stay here and pay me back some of that money I spent."
"SpongeBob","  Hurray for Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," While I'm gone, Squidward mans the helm."
"SpongeBob"," Psst. Hey, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh, Teddy. You're my favorite snuggle buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, boss. Give me a job to do. Please?"
"Squidward"," Well, why don't you clean the... uh... "
"Squidward"," We can always clean the... uh... "
"Squidward"," Why don't you clean your own... uh... "
"Squidward"," Alright, alright. Um... Ring everything one more time."
"SpongeBob"," Got it!"
"SpongeBob"," Done! More please!"
"Squidward"," Two more times."
"SpongeBob"," Done! Done!"
"Squidward"," Ah, but did you clean down to the subatomic particles?"
"SpongeBob","  I knew I missed something."
"SpongeBob"," Done! Even the theoretical particles are clean. Theoretically. "
"Squidward","  I don't know. Why don't you just, I don't know, see how many things you can flush down the toilet."
"SpongeBob","  Um... are you sure about that boss?"
"Squidward"," Are you questioning my orders?"
"SpongeBob"," I hear and obey my liege."
"Squidward"," Ahh!! What have I done?!"
"SpongeBob"," How am I doing boss? "
"Squidward"," This is a completely irresponsible thing to do!  But I must admit, it looks amazing!"
"SpongeBob"," How about this?"
"Squidward"," And try this!"
"Squidward"," Here they go!"
"SpongeBob"," This will go down good!  Oops."
"Squidward"," That was funny. It almost looked like Mr. Krabs' safe. You know. The one with the secret Krabby Patty formula inside?"
"SpongeBob","  What's really funny is that it was Mr. Krabs' safe. The one with the..."
"Squidward"," How could you?"
"SpongeBob"," You ordered me to!"
"Squidward"," I didn't say the safe!"
"SpongeBob"," You didn't say ""not the safe""!"
"Squidward"," Well, I order you to go get it!"
"SpongeBob"," One second.  Employees must wash hands before leaving."
"Squidward"," What have I done? I flushed SpongeBob down a toilet. Why that's despicable. Even for me."
"Squidward"," Alright! As soon as I get the fry cook out of the toilet, you can all have your Krabby Patties!"
"Squidward"," Ew! Yuck. It's so unsanitary. Can't believe I'm doing this."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I sure hope you're right."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uh, hi."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh! I like that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, relax. That's what my grandma's dentures are made of."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Are you down here?"
"SpongeBob"," Hiya, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Do not touch me! I am way out of my comfort zone!"
"Squidward"," Alright, you've been down here longer than me. Which way?"
"SpongeBob"," Pull my finger."
"SpongeBob"," That way."
"Squidward"," Figures."
"SpongeBob","  Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha! Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha! Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha!"
"SpongeBob"," Look at these strange etchings, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Looks like snakes."
"SpongeBob"," I hope we don't run into anything like that down here."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Over there!"
"SpongeBob"," It's stuck on the pipe!"
"Squidward"," We need to get up there!"
"SpongeBob","  Sewer, sewer! Cha-cha-cha!"
"Squidward"," There it is!"
"Squidward"," Darn it! I missed again!"
"Squidward"," AHH! Leapin' lampreys! They're biting me!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, bite 'em back!"
"Squidward"," Ahh! Ahh! My eyes!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look! There's the safe!"
"Squidward"," Where? Where?"
"SpongeBob"," There it is!"
"SpongeBob","  O Sole Mio."
"Squidward"," Silencio."
"SpongeBob"," Yay! Whoo hoo!"
"Squidward"," What the?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh-heh. Sure do. The Bikini Bottom Mets."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok! But you're gonna miss the cheerleaders!"
"Squidward"," In here!"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh! Look! You are here!"
"Squidward"," Why is the diagram shaped like a giant sewer snake with an arrow pointed to its stomach?"
"Squidward"," What are you doing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Crossing digested by a giant sewer snake off of my to-do list. "
"Squidward"," Oh. That makes sense."
"Squidward"," Snake food!"
"SpongeBob"," Good going, Squidward! You're tickling him! I'll help ya!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, the safe! Squidward! Safe!"
"Squidward"," Don't bother me while I'm hysterical!"
"Squidward"," I'm alive? I'm alive!"
"SpongeBob"," I guess we're just lucky."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, look! You found the safe!"
"Squidward"," Just my luck."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. Is that bad?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What a bunch of malarkey."
"Squidward"," Hey, everybody. The cook's back from the toilet."
"SpongeBob"," Who's hungry?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, cold knees!"
"SpongeBob"," Longpants?  Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants."
"SpongeBob"," Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay!  How do I look?"
"SpongeBob"," You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?"
"Patrick"," Hey man!"
"SpongeBob","  He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, excuse me sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob!  There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied."
"SpongeBob"," Yah, it must be the long pants! "
"Mr. Krabs"," So they are! You'll run the register today!  Into the galley with you Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!"
"Squidward"," But Mr. Krabs? Why? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none! "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?"
"Squidward"," Nothing, there is never a sale."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, how much is the senior discount?"
"Squidward"," There's no senior discount! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward","  What?!"
"SpongeBob"," What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright, alright, that's enough!  I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! Your just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," You should be the maitre' d! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay!  How is that patty treating you sir? "
"SpongeBob"," No, merely a man, a man in longpants.  Oh, my precious longpants!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre' d material."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place. "
"SpongeBob"," As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on! "
"Squidward"," Where's he going?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A place called... manhood. "
"SpongeBob"," Allow me ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing..."
"SpongeBob","  AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour! "
"SpongeBob"," Has it all ready been one hour? One more time!  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," You know, I've never took the drivers test with long pants! I'll do it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this! "
"SpongeBob"," I finally got my drivers license!"
"SpongeBob"," Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment!   Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae."
"SpongeBob"," Breeches?  Oh, oh, these old things?"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," 'Oh,  SpongeRobert."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, would I! I love parties!  "
"SpongeBob"," I'm looking for the party!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, were's all the party hats, where's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, what's that?  The Mermaidman and Barnacleboy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot!  Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaidman movie!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning."
"Squidward"," SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?"
"Squidward"," Nobody does, it's art, now sit down!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward?"
"Squidward"," WHAT?!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you remembering to flip the patties clockwise, it's very important because.."
"Squidward","  PLEASE SIT DOWN! "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," But wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out.  Squidward!"
"Sandy"," Hey SpongeBob, y'all going to see the Mermaidman movie with us?"
"Sandy"," Wow, that sounds pretty grown up, SpongeRobert! "
"SpongeBob"," My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaidman movie!"
"SpongeBob"," Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there! "
"Sandy"," That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!"
"SpongeBob","  Really! "
"SpongeBob"," What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants!   Get off!  Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, for Pete's sake.  Sorry 'bout the legs boyo."
"SpongeBob","  It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!"
"SpongeBob"," Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Is it true that everything is free?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Aah! Thanks, Larry!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You said everything was free."
"Mr. Krabs"," So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?"
"SpongeBob","  Squishy."
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir!"
"SpongeBob"," Ok, I will!"
"SpongeBob"," Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers.  Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, ""Beautiful Angel"". That's normal, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these...  really heavy... pieces of metal for free!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things."
"SpongeBob"," How am I doing?"
"SpongeBob","  Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll be there!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh.  Only now, I'll do it on my back."
"SpongeBob"," I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not. "
"SpongeBob"," Always be hydrating."
"Mr. Krabs"," Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes! Yes I do!  Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice potbelly!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Squidward"," What are you... Whoa! You've been working out."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I hope you have some glue for my because I am ripped!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!"
"SpongeBob"," Larry?"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today."
"SpongeBob"," I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back. "
"SpongeBob","  Walk on your back."
"SpongeBob"," And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water."
"SpongeBob"," I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker."
"SpongeBob"," You wanted to see me, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty..."
"SpongeBob"," This sounds great."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!"
"SpongeBob"," You mean a brug?"
"SpongeBob"," Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, what happened?"
"SpongeBob"," Larry, your brug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!"
"SpongeBob","  Brug. "
"Squidward"," Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what a great day."
"Squidward"," And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up."
"Mr. Krabs"," I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Sandy","  It's here! Yee-Haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month!  Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day keeps getting better!  Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!"
"Sandy"," Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations,  now!"
"Sandy"," Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter."
"Sandy"," Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from."
"Sandy"," Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably burrowed."
"Sandy"," I gotta find new subjects."
"Sandy"," Who won't mind being observed."
"Sandy"," Eureka!"
"Sandy"," Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?"
"Patrick"," Ooh! I could use a mint! Mmm!"
"Sandy"," No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology."
"Patrick"," That doesn't sound tasty."
"SpongeBob"," What do we have to do?"
"Sandy"," It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal."
"SpongeBob"," Act normal?"
"Sandy"," Yeah. Just do what you naturally do.  Be natural. Starting now!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, natural greeting to you, friend."
"Patrick"," Natural greeting returned."
"SpongeBob"," Would you like to have some natural fun?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yes. Please."
"SpongeBob"," Naturally. "
"Sandy"," Aww. Alright. Experiment's done."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?"
"Patrick","  Hey, did we do good?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, can I have an A+?"
"Patrick"," Oh! Oh! Yeah!  I want an A+ too!"
"Patrick"," Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?"
"SpongeBob","  Pretty please with sugar on top?"
"Sandy"," Yes, yes. You both get an A+."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!!!"
"Patrick"," I knew it!"
"Sandy"," Subjects acting natural. Resume observation."
"SpongeBob"," I got an A+!"
"Sandy"," Oh, forget it."
"Sandy"," When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm..."
"Sandy"," Double eureka!"
"Sandy"," Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or. Or expose us to gamma rays?"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"Sandy"," It's a guaranteed A+."
"Patrick"," Oh! It's like a dream!"
"Sandy"," Ok. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Easy sneezy!"
"Sandy","  Eew."
"Patrick"," Hey, yeah. Whatever he said."
"Sandy"," Then off you go."
"Sandy"," Time to get to work."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy!"
"SpongeBob"," We're back!"
"Sandy"," Good job, fellers!"
"Patrick"," We're an awesome team!"
"SpongeBob"," We sure are, buddy!"
"Sandy"," Ok, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount. Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later. "
"SpongeBob","  Aye-aye, Captain Sandy."
"Sandy"," Oh. And Patrick, you're in charge."
"Sandy","  All systems check."
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?"
"Patrick","  I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge."
"SpongeBob"," So, what's it gonna be boss?"
"Patrick"," Uh, the first one?"
"SpongeBob","  You're in charge."
"Patrick","  I'm in charge."
"SpongeBob"," One."
"SpongeBob"," Ahem."
"Patrick","  I'm in charge."
"Patrick"," Two."
"SpongeBob"," Three."
"Patrick","  I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge."
"SpongeBob"," Forty-seven. Forty-seven?"
"Patrick"," Uh. Huh? What?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven."
"Patrick","  I don't know if I wanna do it this way."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, boss man. How do you wanna do it?"
"Patrick"," Uh... "
"SpongeBob"," How about you count the white and I count the black sand."
"Patrick"," Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha."
"Patrick"," Forty-eight, forty-... nine,  Oh! Oh, fifty!"
"SpongeBob","  One, two, three, four, five. six,..."
"Sandy"," Time to initiate the first variable. One big bowl. One small bowl. Exactly eight ounces per bowl.  Free ice cream! Free ice cream! One day only! Get your free ice cream!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy! Let's go!"
"SpongeBob"," You're the boss!"
"Sandy"," Free ice cream!"
"Squidward"," Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!"
"Sandy","  Hey, boys! How'd ya like a nice free bowl of tootsie frootsie ice cream?"
"Sandy"," Okie dokie!"
"Squidward"," One free ice cream, please?"
"Sandy","  All sold out. Maybe I'll get some later."
"Patrick"," Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you wanna trade?"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"Patrick"," You got more ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big."
"Patrick"," Well, I wanna trade back!"
"Patrick"," There's only one fair thing to do."
"SpongeBob"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you call that fair?"
"Patrick"," I'm in charge!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh... Oh. Yeah."
"Sandy"," Time for variable two. More free ice cream here! Now, with the same size cones!"
"Squidward"," Huh? I just got my slippers on!"
"Sandy"," Here ya go!"
"Patrick"," I'll take those my good man."
"SpongeBob"," But Patrick, I..."
"Patrick"," I'm in charge."
"Squidward"," One free cone, please?"
"Sandy"," All gone!"
"Squidward"," For the love of Pete!"
"SpongeBob"," Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?"
"Patrick"," Hmmm...  Rub my feet first!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on!"
"Patrick"," Who's in charge?"
"SpongeBob"," Alright, I'll rub your feet."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!"
"Patrick"," Oh... I'll fix that."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you are making very poor choices!"
"Patrick"," Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now, count that bucket of white sand."
"SpongeBob"," Alright, I will!"
"SpongeBob"," One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three."
"SpongeBob"," Done! Now to count the black sand."
"Patrick"," Oh, that's a pity."
"Patrick"," Looks like you'll have to start over."
"SpongeBob"," Aahh!  Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Yes I am."
"SpongeBob"," Would you like sprinkles on it?"
"Patrick"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," Jeepers! I didn't see that comin'!"
"Patrick"," You're not leaving until I say so!"
"Sandy","  Sandy to Gary! Sandy to Gary! How serious is the situation?"
"Sandy"," Oh, I didn't think this all the way through! I've gotta shut this down!"
"Squidward"," Ah-ha!"
"Squidward"," I want my free..."
"Sandy","  Open the door! The experiment is over!  Open the door!"
"Patrick"," You heard Sandy! Open the door!"
"SpongeBob"," You open it!"
"Patrick"," No, you open it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, you open it!"
"Patrick"," Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!"
"Sandy","  It's me! Sandy!"
"Sandy"," The experiment is over!"
"SpongeBob"," But we didn't even finish counting the sand!"
"Sandy"," I didn't care about the sand! I just wanted to observe you acting naturally. So, I hid microphones and cameras around your house..."
"SpongeBob","  Et tu, Gary?"
"Patrick"," I was a monster! I deserve a Z-!  "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk."
"Patrick"," I blame science! Stupid science!"
"Sandy"," Everybody gets an A+ and ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah!"
"Patrick"," "
"Squidward"," What is going on?"
"Squidward"," I know it's a stupid question but is there any ice cream left?"
"Sandy","  Sorry. We're all out."
"Squidward","  You ate it all! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?!  There's gotta be some left in here!"
"Sandy"," Now, let the real experiment begin."
"Squidward"," Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!"
"Plankton"," Why couldn't I see it before?  The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious!  Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up!  Nothing can turn them from their central purpose!"
"SpongeBob","  Yoo-hoo!  Who wants their tummies tickled? "
"Plankton"," No...  My weapons!  Ouch!"
"SpongeBob","  Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton.  They're furry buckets of love.  See?  And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles?  Jellyfish honey!"
"SpongeBob","  Come and get it! "
"Plankton","  No! Come back! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?"
"Plankton","  Heh-heh-heh... "
"Mr. Krabs","  When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money! "
"Plankton","  Er, money's not everything, you know. "
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Course it is!  Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound. "
"Plankton","  Well, if you love money so much,  why don't you marry it?"
"Mr. Krabs","  If I could, I would."
"Plankton","  Would you now...? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You still here? "
"Plankton","  Yuhh!  This gives me an idea.  Owww!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash...  ...alone.  Huh?  Umm...  Hello? Miss?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh, careful now, careful.  Your ink will run."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh.  Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like youuu  doin'... on a bench like this?"
"Mr. Krabs","  What??  Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down.  Dooh! "
"Mr. Krabs","  The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs.  And yours?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know somethin'?  You look like a million bucks when you smile.  Cashina, would you make this old crab's day  and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner? "
"Plankton","  ...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! Oof!  Allow me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh. I do have a very special recipe..."
"Mr. Krabs","  ...for delicious kisses!  Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?"
"Plankton","  ...just as I planned. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Wow, what a woman!"
"Plankton"," Ugh. Well, I finally did it— I kissed a crab!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, Cashina... "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, no, no!  I was, uh...  I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see.  Like this!  Right, hmm... "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl, me little beluga...  I never thought I'd say this, but...  I may have found you a new mom."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, she's...  ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us.  She's here! Out of me way!  Hello, me little money stack.  I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl. "
"Plankton","  Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk...  Ah. Girls like shoes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me talk to her."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Cashina, you know I love ya.  And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?"
"Plankton","  Eeeeeeee..."
"Plankton"," Perfect!  When we're married, he'll have to tell me the secret formula!  Yeah!"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner."
"SpongeBob","  I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great!  Here's your budget."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy!  No... disrespect for your new bride."
"Patrick","  Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you like our house red or or house yellow? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all If money can't buy you love, it can give you love."
"SpongeBob"," Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs "
"Patrick","  Hooray! I win! "
"SpongeBob","  It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here."
"Plankton","  Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I went to bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tarter sauce when I'm afraid."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask."
"Mr. Krabs"," The what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, anything for you, baby.  I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there."
"Plankton"," Oh boy, here it comes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, me sweet. Here it is.  Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before.  So, here goes.  Erngh. "
"Plankton","  Come on, Krabs  Let it all out! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton?!"
"Plankton"," No, no, I'm not Plankton  I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You... monster! "
"Plankton"," You're not gonna crush me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?"
"Plankton"," Get a hold of yourself, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?"
"Plankton"," You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  I have no idea, Pearly."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now instead of wasting my precious money on your ""clothes"" and your ""school supplies""...  You can waste your own."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's the spirit."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll miss you around the house."
"Mr. Krabs"," I was talkin' to the money."
"SpongeBob","  You dropped this."
"Patrick"," I declare a thumb war! "
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yah!"
"Patrick"," Now that was a great thumb war, mister!"
"SpongeBob"," It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony."
"SpongeBob"," Great job, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you guys are stupendous customers. "
"SpongeBob"," Flipping."
"Mr. Krabs"," Spongebob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like i told to do?"
"SpongeBob"," I sure have, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now back to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! "
"SpongeBob"," ... "
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you."
"SpongeBob"," I've got two thumbs-up! "
"Squidward"," Oh. That's...thank you. I think."
"SpongeBob","  Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up. "
"Sandy","  This old thing? It's just something I threw on."
"SpongeBob"," Well, girl, you really make it work. "
"Sandy"," Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions. "
"SpongeBob"," You got the right stuff, golden boys. "
"Sandy"," Spongebob, don't you think that you may be using the thumbs-up just a teensy bit too much?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you kidding? "
"SpongeBob"," The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!"
"Sandy"," Yeah, I know. But when you do it all the the thumbs-up loses its meaning. It becomes not special."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up. "
"Sandy"," I don't know, SpongeBob. I think you should be careful."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale."
"SpongeBob"," What could do wrong?  "
"SpongeBob"," Ah.  Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, guy. Way to wait. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, guy. Way to walk. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this feels great."
"SpongeBob"," Way to flick that eye booger--  "
"SpongeBob"," my thumbs. My thumbs! MY THUMBS!!!!"
"SpongeBob"," How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?"
"SpongeBob"," An action like a thumbs-up?"
"SpongeBob"," But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you boneless invertebrate lazy bones...  Come on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days."
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Uh, let me give you a hand. My thumbs work."
"SpongeBob"," No! I can do it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm sorry, son, but I have a business to run. I'm gonna have to let you go."
"SpongeBob"," That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I understand."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now where's me new fry cook?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There he is. Come on in here."
"Patrick"," Uh, sorry, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?"
"Patrick"," Uh, yeah, I guess. I probably won't even be able to do good flipping."
"SpongeBob"," With a little practice, you could do anything.   Oh..."
"SpongeBob"," OI' Patty flippin' patties. Who'd a' thunk it, huh?"
"Sandy","  SpongeBob! It's me, Sandy!  Hey SpongeBob! I haven't seen you in days, whatcha doin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Waiting for autumn."
"Sandy"," Come now, it can't be that bad!"
"SpongeBob"," Leave me Sandra, forget you ever knew me! Erase from your memory the face of this useless sponge! With these......mutilated thumbs!"
"Sandy","  Don't give up SpongeBob! You have to find something you love! Something to live for! "
"SpongeBob"," And what might that be?"
"Sandy","  I don't know SpongeBob! That's a question you have to answer for yourself. "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy? Sandy! Sandy come back!  I need you to help me open this jar of peanut butter!  Enough sitting around feeling sorry for myself!  "
"Patrick"," Uhhhhhh, turn over. "
"SpongeBob"," My thumbs are better and I am ready to work!"
"Patrick"," The job's taken."
"SpongeBob"," Well I'm taking it back."
"Patrick"," Just how are you gonna do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Thumb war."
"Patrick","  Ungaw!"
"Patrick"," Admit it! You have been bested!"
"SpongeBob"," Never! "
"Patrick"," Then prepare to be pinned!"
"Sandy"," Don't give up! Something to live for! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeeeaaahh!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob wins! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you old patty junkie! Welcome home son! "
"Patrick"," It's okay, I hate work anyway. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh Patrick!"
"Patrick"," No really, I do hate work!  Everybody's laughing! Oh hey SpongeBob, I got something for ya!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, maybe I could use a little music to make my work even more fun!"
"SpongeBob"," Wah! Ah ha! There you are."
"SpongeBob"," I just mopped the floor with you. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, goodnight Krusty Krab. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello Sharkface, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants."
"SpongeBob","  I am? Oh, thank you, Mr. Sharkface. Who are your friends?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, fancy stitching."
"SpongeBob"," Do I get a jacket?"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! I mean, hey, new friends."
"SpongeBob","  Are they okay?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but what if they're hurt?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess so."
"SpongeBob","  That guy seemed really scared of us."
"SpongeBob"," Wah! Who's a baby?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, you know maybe we should let it slide, there are plenty of clubs in the sea."
"SpongeBob"," The whats?"
"SpongeBob"," The cops! "
"SpongeBob"," Well I'm glad that's all cleared up."
"SpongeBob"," Oh uh, didn't you hear, the nice officers said there won't be a showdown."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, me? You know I'm not really the showdown type."
"SpongeBob","  I was just caught up in the moment, I just love making new friends."
"SpongeBob"," Um,  oh okay see you guys there. Bye."
"SpongeBob"," Showdown? I can't fight in a showdown! I'll have to go into the Witness Protection program,  I'll have to quit working at The Krusty Krab, I'll never flip a succulent Krabby Patty ever again. Oh what have I done?  Hey yo Sponge-o, we were in your neck of the woods and decided to pickup your beloved pet Gary, if you wanna see him you better hightail your porous caboose over to the showdown, sincerely Sharkface and the other Sharks, Gary! No!  I have to save Gary, I have to go to the showdown! I have to get ready to fight! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Back up Pods, don't make me hurt you!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?! Oh no, I accidentally joined this bad boy gang and I'm supposed to fight in the showdown so I get to save Gary, and I don't wanna go into the Witness Protection program, but I can't fight cause you're my friend."
"Squidward"," What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe. "
"SpongeBob"," A troupe? What do you mean?"
"Squidward"," A dance troupe, you numb-skull! This is a dance showdown. No one is going to fight!"
"SpongeBob","  But what about those girls that screamed and fainted?"
"SpongeBob"," What about the fruit vendor? He just gave you his fruit and ran away!"
"SpongeBob"," But what about the club? The bouncer said you destroyed the place."
"Squidward"," Oh brother."
"SpongeBob"," But, you Sharks kidnapped Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! I'm not a criminal by association."
"Squidward"," Will you stop yapping already?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right Squidward, Gary, lay down some tunes!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! It's the coppers!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm so sorry officer, we were just dancing."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, leave it to the sponge. Hey yo. "
"Mr. Krabs"," And the winner is... SpongeBob Squarepants and the Sharks! "
"Patrick"," We saved the rec center!"
"Squidward"," What rec center?"
"SpongeBob"," Now everybody's a winner."
"Squidward"," I didn't win anything."
"Plankton"," More fruit punch, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," You know Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!"
"Plankton"," Oh I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?"
"Plankton"," Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough."
"SpongeBob"," How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?"
"Plankton"," Just lay face-down and keep still. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Plankton"," Alright. Party's over. Go home!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch."
"Plankton"," No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow."
"SpongeBob"," Nah! I feel fine!"
"Plankton"," Are you sure?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!"
"Plankton"," You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off.  Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say ""Secret formula""?"
"Plankton","  ""Se-cret Form-ula"""
"Plankton"," Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula."
"Plankton"," Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait!  Just keeping track of my copy."
"Plankton"," What are you doing here!? You said you would take today off."
"SpongeBob"," But I feel great today."
"Plankton"," Are you sure? Because you're sweating. "
"Plankton"," But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. "
"Squidward"," Whatever. "
"SpongeBob"," Morning."
"Squidward"," I said ""Whatever.""  Wait, didn't I just... Didn't I..."
"Squidward"," There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare!  Wake up!  "
"Squidward"," Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!"
"Squidward"," If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything!  I really am dreaming! "
"SpongeBob"," What's your name, handsome stranger?"
"SpongeBob","  Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common!  I always wanted a twin brother!  How do you feel about bubbles?"
"SpongeBob"," Jelly fishing?"
"SpongeBob"," How about Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," I think I'll nickname you... Me two! "
"Plankton"," Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?"
"Plankton"," Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula.  Time to adjust my plan. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two."
"Plankton","  Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?"
"Plankton"," Now where was I? Oh yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. "
"Plankton"," Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs  and ask him for the secret formula."
"Plankton"," And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!"
"Plankton"," You see, this is why I never had children."
"Squidward"," Yup. I'm still dreaming.  Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream?  I heard you like your patties ""Ground""! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!"
"Squidward"," Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming!  What's that under there?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Under where?"
"Squidward"," That's right.  ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! "
"Plankton","  He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, No! No!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look. Another handsome devil.  We'll call you Me Three  Aww. Let's go flip some patties."
"Plankton"," Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs.  March! March my pretties and learn the formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only gonna tell you the secret formula one more time!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks."
"Plankton"," They all know the formula!"
"SpongeBob"," OK. Thanks."
"SpongeBob"," Sure."
"SpongeBob","  Looks like you sponges have everything covered."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?"
"SpongeBob"," The Chum Bucket?"
"Plankton"," ♪I'm gonna know the formula! I'm gonna know the formula...♪"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula."
"Plankton"," Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!"
"SpongeBob"," You gotta help him! I think he's sick or something."
"SpongeBob"," Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!"
"Plankton"," I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner."
"SpongeBob"," What does that mean?"
"Plankton"," It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!"
"SpongeBob"," Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't!  No! Don't disappear! "
"Plankton"," Quickly man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!"
"Plankton"," Wait no! "
"Patrick"," Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... "
"Plankton"," What's the formula?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here."
"Plankton"," Geez, What a cheapskate. I can't believe I failed again!"
"SpongeBob"," I can believe it."
"Plankton"," Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you see, its... Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge.  I can't believe they're all gone."
"Plankton"," You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, those imitations were my friends."
"Plankton"," One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around."
"Plankton"," Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip "
"Plankton"," Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!"
"Squidward"," Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!"
"Plankton"," Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three. two...  OW! Right on my keys!"
"Patrick"," "
"Patrick","  What?"
"Patrick"," But my home's not for sale."
"Patrick","  Sold? Where am I gonna live now?"
"SpongeBob"," What's happening, Patrick, you going on a hike?"
"Patrick"," It's a forever hike."
"SpongeBob"," A forever hike?"
"Patrick"," Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins."
"SpongeBob"," Who's Nick Fishkins?"
"Patrick"," He shows up on television, and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it.  Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!"
"Patrick"," Wow!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, we might as well spend the night here. It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!"
"Patrick","  Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat! "
"Squidward","  Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively... happy!  ♪Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!♪ "
"SpongeBob","  Morning, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Good morning, SpongeBob!  Oh, that's why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob."
"Patrick","  Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?"
"SpongeBob","  Built a house. "
"Squidward"," What the-- why?"
"Patrick"," Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home."
"SpongeBob"," So now we live here."
"Squidward"," Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?"
"Patrick"," Well, he hasn't paid us yet!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, he said it right on the TV, ""I wanna buy your home!"" But we haven't seen any money!"
"Squidward"," Ohhh... let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?"
"Patrick"," Really weird!"
"Squidward"," Oh, listen you dumb--  Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that! "
"SpongeBob"," Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy?  You look like you slept in a pile of trash!"
"SpongeBob"," A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!"
"Mr. Krabs"," With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee."
"SpongeBob","  How much?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm... your paycheck oughtta cover it!"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive."
"Squidward","  Ah, work is done!  Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!"
"SpongeBob","  I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!"
"Squidward"," Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!"
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Squidward"," Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed."
"SpongeBob"," How many's a lot?"
"Squidward"," Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!"
"SpongeBob"," But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--"
"Squidward"," And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak... German!"
"Patrick","  Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, uh, a band lives there now!"
"Patrick"," A rock band?"
"Squidward"," Um, yes."
"Patrick"," Cause my house is a rock?"
"Squidward"," Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I could learn German!"
"Patrick"," And I could learn what ""learn"" is."
"Squidward"," Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation!  What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German!  Uh, German, hallo?"
"SpongeBob"," Ach! Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," Say what?"
"SpongeBob"," Guten Morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen, um mein alte Heimat besuchen. (Good morning! My name is SpongeBob! I have come to visit my old home."
"Squidward"," Uh, please, vould you speaken-zee English, I need za bractize!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Oh, ja, I mean, sure, good morning! My name is SpongeBob, what is your name?"
"Squidward"," Umm... Gerhard."
"SpongeBob"," Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home."
"Squidward"," Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!"
"SpongeBob","  Wife? Where is she?"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob."
"Squidward","  She's shy... well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, would you mind if I stay for zupper?  Whatchya having?"
"Squidward"," Umm... kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz."
"SpongeBob"," Kerglooginpfiefer, that's my favorite! Uh, what's your wife's name?"
"Squidward"," I don't know... Hedvig!  Dunt movin! Not a schtepp!  Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz!  Hey, man, like, what's happening?"
"Patrick"," I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in."
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments."
"Patrick"," What do you play?"
"Squidward"," Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet."
"Patrick"," There's no such thing!"
"Squidward","  Sure there is."
"Patrick"," Prove it!"
"Squidward"," I'll be right back! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Hello!  You must be Hedvig!"
"Squidward"," Hedvig?  Oh, oh yeah, that's me, Hedvig!"
"SpongeBob"," I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it."
"Squidward"," One--  One second!  Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!"
"SpongeBob"," Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?"
"Squidward"," I don't have children!  I mean- I mean, yeah, yeah, outside please! "
"SpongeBob"," I love outdoor concerts."
"Squidward"," Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?"
"Patrick"," That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!"
"Patrick"," What's going on?"
"SpongeBob"," Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!"
"Squidward","  ♪Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!♪"
"SpongeBob","  I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key."
"Patrick"," They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward","  That's it, I'm done! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!? What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?"
"Squidward"," You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial-- that's all!"
"Patrick"," So... is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?"
"Squidward","  He doesn't live in the houses he buys."
"SpongeBob"," Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?"
"Squidward"," He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!"
"Patrick"," He flips houses for a living?"
"Squidward"," Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away! "
"SpongeBob"," Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!"
"Patrick","  I know!"
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One... two... three! "
"SpongeBob"," Sure is!"
"Squidward","  What happened?"
"SpongeBob"," We flipped your house for ya."
"Squidward"," Who's that driving away?"
"Patrick"," That was Nick Fishkins."
"Squidward"," And what did he say?"
"Patrick"," He said ""Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!"""
"Squidward"," I... I can't believe you did that!"
"Squidward"," Ow! Ach du lieber... "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary! It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and—"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all."
"SpongeBob"," Let's see what's inside."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!"
"SpongeBob"," ""A great fortune has fallen upon you.""  Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future.  ""Happy trails will follow you always.""  Your fortune came true too!"
"SpongeBob"," Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward","  Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one. "
"Squidward","  No.  Way."
"Squidward"," ""You will be rewarded for your particular talent."" Right. "
"Squidward"," Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Me cash register, me money. "
"Squidward"," And that's why my depression is award-winning."
"SpongeBob","  Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You know, you're right, SpongeBob.  We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me."
"SpongeBob","  All right!"
"Squidward","  Hooray. "
"SpongeBob"," Those fortune cookies are a hit."
"Plankton"," Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese! "
"Plankton"," Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes!"
"Plankton","  Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?"
"Plankton"," No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So..."
"Plankton","  Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic."
"Plankton"," This will be a good one, ""You stink."" "
"Plankton"," Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!"
"SpongeBob","  Time for a refill."
"Squidward"," My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs. "
"Plankton"," Let the wave of misfortune begin."
"Mr. Krabs"," What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before.  Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck."
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!"""
"Plankton","  Hello! Did someone say copepod?"
"Plankton"," Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!"
"Mr. Krabs","  J-just how true are these cookie fortunes SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ""You will die."" "
"Mr. Krabs","  Me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're right me boy-o,  I've got to face me fortune. "
"Plankton"," The scheme is working perfectly, and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula. I promised myself I wouldn't cry. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, this crowd is impossible!"
"SpongeBob","  Leave it to me Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours.  Hot stuff comin' through! "
"Plankton"," Don't worry secret formula, I'm comin' baby!"
"SpongeBob","  Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this."
"Plankton","  Finally!  No!  Ah-hah.  I have had enough!  Get out of my restaurant you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes,  they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you out! "
"Plankton"," I guess I didn't really think that through."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I figured the funeral fortune was phony Plankton."
"Plankton"," Oh yeah?! What are you going to do about it Eugene?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing Sheldon. Here, have a fortune cookie."
"Plankton","  ""You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve.""  Hey!"
"Plankton"," Ahh! Hey! Ooh! Mommy! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh."
"Patrick"," No, no, just—"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. "
"Patrick"," It's harder to walk, but worth it."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day buying ourselves the perfect ice cream."
"Patrick"," So many flavors."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?"
"Patrick"," No, that's too fancy."
"Patrick"," With real rocks!"
"SpongeBob"," Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps."
"Mr. Krabs"," Bump.  When did food get so ugly?"
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Lonely Krab Dinner for One Now 30% lonelier."" Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient."
"SpongeBob"," Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh. Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, ""Krabby Patties Taste so nice that they... taste nice."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o."
"SpongeBob"," Me!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, me, me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And I've got the perfect guy for the job."
"Patrick"," Krabby Patties They taste so nice, that they taste nice."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that was my slogan."
"Patrick"," I'm already a star."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," I—oh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don, will this commercial really help me make money?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How much ""a lot more""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, then let's fill her up with filler!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy."
"SpongeBob"," But what is ""filler""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ho-ho, that sounds great!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, why does that barrel say ""sand""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's imported. It's spelled ""sand"" but it's pronounced, ""filler."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm rich, boy-o, rich!"
"SpongeBob"," Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes, we can."
"SpongeBob"," Hooray, finally!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whatcha doing, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Making Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," You mean my last one for the morning rush?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, ever."
"SpongeBob"," You mean my last one for today-ever?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired."
"SpongeBob","  Fired?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But I'm ready to re-hire you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything."
"Mr. Krabs"," Then follow me."
"SpongeBob"," You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer."
"Mr. Krabs"," You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, it's so convenient, see? "
"Squidward"," And what about me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired."
"Squidward"," Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh! No, you're just fired."
"Squidward"," What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  ""Dear Mr. Krabs—"""
"Mr. Krabs"," Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket."
"Squidward"," What the—what?!  ""I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel 'Dial D for Doily!"""
"SpongeBob"," Ahem,  ""hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."""
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop."
"Mr. Krabs"," Atta boy, embrace the future!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial."
"SpongeBob"," I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I don't know."
"SpongeBob"," I'll come with you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Aww."
"Patrick","  Aww."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, oof!"
"Squidward"," Ow."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams."
"Squidward"," I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum."
"SpongeBob"," I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off."
"Squidward"," Totally out of character."
"Squidward","  I hate everyone.  Huh, much better."
"Patrick","  ""Tastes so nice that they—"""
"Squidward"," They taste like lice!"
"Patrick"," Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot."
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," What are you doing with this—ow!"
"Patrick","  ""Tastes so nice that they taste nice."""
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, sure. I get it."
"Patrick"," But he's my friend."
"Patrick","  What am I doing again?"
"Patrick"," Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!"
"Patrick","  See you later, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Aww."
"Plankton"," Finally, now is my chance to strike."
"SpongeBob"," Welcome to the original Krusty—"
"Plankton"," Pfft, never happened."
"Plankton"," Now to make my escape."
"Plankton"," Aren't you gonna try and stop me?"
"SpongeBob"," That'll be $1.99, please."
"Plankton"," What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know."
"SpongeBob"," Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop."
"SpongeBob"," See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!"
"Plankton"," Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go."
"Plankton","  Yes, you fools!"
"Squidward"," Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?"
"SpongeBob"," Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either."
"Squidward"," Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?"
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love."
"SpongeBob"," Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick."
"Patrick"," That's it. I can't take it anymore. Everybody out!"
"Patrick"," I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers."
"SpongeBob"," Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what?"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!"
"Patrick","  I thought they tasted familiar!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Missed you."
"Patrick"," I missed you too."
"SpongeBob","  I got something for you, from one friend to another."
"Patrick"," No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!"
"Patrick"," Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship."
"SpongeBob"," Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty."
"Patrick"," But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach."
"Mr. Krabs"," And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say..."
"Patrick"," That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are..."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
"Patrick"," ...Made with sand!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, no!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's strange."
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?"
"Squidward"," Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, did you do all this?"
"SpongeBob"," Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped."
"Patrick"," A friend always helps. It's called ""frelping,"" and I was very frelpful."
"Mr. Krabs"," But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand."
"SpongeBob"," The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh."
"Mr. Krabs","  Fresh?"
"SpongeBob"," Go on, have a bite."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, no I—"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, just a nibble."
"Mr. Krabs"," Here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing, we're not selling them."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we just give them away."
"Mr. Krabs","  Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great, now get back to work! "
"Patrick"," Watch this. "
"SpongeBob"," Mmm-hey!"
"Sandy"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," Hiyah, hiyah! Hiyah!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's only, um...  June o'clock. "
"Sandy"," It ain't autumn!   Oh, my tree is dying!"
"Patrick","  Good, we can use the wood."
"Sandy"," Patrick, stop! I can save it with science."
"Patrick"," Okay. Hmm. "
"Sandy"," "
"Sandy"," "
"Sandy"," Jumpin' beans on a trampoline! You're starvin'! I got to make you the best fertilizer known to critter-kind!"
"Sandy","     Ah, growth pills.  Hi!  Nuts.  Ah-ha!  Yee-haw!"
"Sandy","  Aw, I hope this is the pick-me-up you needed ole' girl.  Well, kiss my grits! This here's the biggest acorn I ever did see!  And so are those! I'd better start storing these for winter.  I might need an alternate storage solution."
"Sandy"," Hey there, SpongeBob? Could you swing by my place?"
"Sandy"," I love squirreling away nuts, but this is just too much!"
"SpongeBob"," I'd say you've certainly got a real nutmare on your hands."
"Sandy"," Just dump these somewhere! I'm gonna put more under my bed."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, ma'am!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. Who are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's."
"SpongeBob"," Meant to be eatin' eh?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow. It's coming in great."
"SpongeBob"," Even better!"
"Sandy"," So some Shalmon guy told you people would want to eat my nuts and you believe it?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham."
"Sandy"," Shertainly not! I mean certainly not!  Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make."
"Sandy"," Woo-hoo! That's delicious!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! Patrick would wanna try this."
"Patrick","  Try what?"
"Sandy"," Patrick, that Nutty Butter is for eating."
"Patrick"," I know.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!"
"Sandy"," Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?"
"Patrick"," Can I have some more?  It's hard to eat off this side of me. "
"Sandy"," Sure, Patrick! Here's the last of it!"
"Patrick"," Thanks, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," There. Everything is back to normal.  What in tarnation?"
"Patrick"," Hey, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Patrick, what's going on here?"
"Patrick"," I want more Nutty Butter."
"Sandy"," Who are all these people?"
"Patrick"," Oh.  They licked the Nutty Butter off my back.  And now they're here for more."
"Sandy"," Aw, gosh Patrick. I don't have enough to feed everyone."
"Sandy"," Well, I don't want to let anyone down. I can make some more acorns!"
"Sandy"," Making everyone's day with my Nutty Butter really gives me the warm and tinglies!"
"Patrick"," Uh huh."
"Sandy"," In fact, demands have been so high, I scienced up a way to increase my production."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt.  Then the tubes take them inside  where I turn them into Nutty Butter."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able."
"Sandy"," Don't worry about my tree, SpongeBob. Worry about the crowd of Nutty Butter fans outside."
"Sandy"," We're gonna need a lot more acorns to feed them all."
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, ""Something, something, something, science."" And who are we to argue with science?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! The nuts stopped!"
"Patrick"," Hold on! I got this!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!"
"Patrick"," And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!"
"Sandy"," Please, please no pushing! I'll make more! Remember, Sandy's the squirrel you can count on!"
"Sandy"," Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?"
"SpongeBob"," The tree got real sick!"
"Patrick"," Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts."
"Sandy"," You used all the nuts? Jumpin' Jiminy! Time for another dose of fertilizer!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!"
"SpongeBob"," Shalmon?"
"Sandy"," Wait, you're the one who said I should feed my nuts to the people?"
"Patrick","  I didn't know there was gonna be a test!"
"Sandy"," Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends."
"Sandy"," Thanks, Shammy. But I'm a one tree kind of squirrel. I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place. Order the ole' girl some nutritious new dirt from Texas!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And how was your meal today, ma'am?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that's the way you want it."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community."
"SpongeBob","  Community!"
"SpongeBob"," See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see what other nice people are saying."
"SpongeBob"," Nothing! I just love to shriek!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Not on my bulletin board!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected."
"SpongeBob"," Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? ""Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted."" Signed, Guybesideu3?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  ""Dumb-blurted! LOL!""?, ""What's the Point""?, ""I could make a better patty out of mud""?! Where are all these notes coming from?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!"
"Squidward"," Huh?  Hmm."
"SpongeBob"," If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is."
"Patrick","  Hello!"
"Patrick"," Hey, that's me!"
"Patrick"," But I wasn't com..."
"Patrick","  Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse."
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here."
"SpongeBob"," No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here."
"SpongeBob"," Now it's smaller than that one!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?"
"Squidward"," Oh, he responded hours ago."
"SpongeBob"," Well, why didn't you tell me?"
"Squidward"," Because I don't care."
"SpongeBob"," That's for me! ""Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139!"" Cordially, P-Star7."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, why did you have to say that?"
"SpongeBob"," You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not true!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And does anyone need to buy a pen?"
"Mr. Krabs"," How about some paper?"
"Patrick"," What's wrong?"
"SpongeBob"," It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab."
"Patrick"," Oh, I think they were all good things."
"SpongeBob"," Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside."
"Patrick"," Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more."
"SpongeBob"," No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139."
"Patrick","  You were Fry-Banshee?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"Patrick"," Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves..."
"SpongeBob"," He said that?!"
"Patrick"," Oh, not yet!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?"
"Squidward","  I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!"
"Mr. Krabs"," He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!"
"Patrick","  No, I'm not."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!"
"SpongeBob"," You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!"
"Squidward"," Huh?  ""Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register."" P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yocals understand I'm working here? Ironically!"
"Squidward"," I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!"
"SpongeBob"," People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, that's it! Everybody out!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message."
"Mr. Krabs"," We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!"
"SpongeBob"," A lesson in polite manners."
"Squidward"," Or we could push him off a cliff."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!"
"SpongeBob","  Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy."
"Mr. Krabs","  This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?"
"SpongeBob","  Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower."
"Squidward","  I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something."
"SpongeBob"," So that's what happens to the ketchup stains."
"SpongeBob"," Surprise, P-Star7!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'll tear ya to pieces!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you're P-Star7?"
"Patrick"," Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way."
"SpongeBob"," So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth."
"Patrick"," Yeah, I think."
"SpongeBob"," You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower."
"Squidward","  Oh, ratfish!"
"SpongeBob","  Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn? "
"Squidward"," Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7."
"Mr. Krabs","  Rev your excitement engines, Mr. Squidward!  Do you not know what tomorrow is?"
"Squidward"," Another monotonous day I spend walking in slow motion towards an empty horizon?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, that's today! Tomorrow is Food Con!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoo! Food Con! Wait, what's a Food Con?"
"Squidward"," Additionally, who cares?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward! Food Con is the biggest convention of food fans in the entire ocean!  The best chefs and cooks gather together and compete for the top prize The Golden Cornucopia! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! The Krabby Patty is a sure bet to win the Golden Cornucopia!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You darn tootin' it is! And you two will be me right claw men! Eh, could use some extra muscle to set up the booth.  Perfect! Let's hit the road!"
"Mr. Krabs"," As you can see gentlemen, I have spared no expense on our transportation! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ta da!"
"SpongeBob"," Woo!"
"Patrick"," What a ride!"
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs","  And I brought plenty of free samples to sell!"
"SpongeBob"," This is the best day ever!"
"SpongeBob","  I spy with my little eye..."
"Patrick"," Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes!"
"Patrick","  I spy with my little eye... "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Patrick"," Oh ho! Yes! Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," I spy with my little eye..."
"Patrick"," Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, how did you know?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Enough!! You both are barnacles on me brain!"
"SpongeBob"," The world's second biggest lump is only 50 miles away! We gotta see it!"
"Patrick"," The world's least exciting sweater! My parents fell in love there! We gotta go!"
"Mr. Krabs"," We are not stoppin' 'til we get to Food Con!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Hey!"
"Squidward"," Grr!! For the last time, we get it! Trucks have horns!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward! Give it a try!"
"Squidward"," If I do, will you promise to stop?"
"Squidward"," Alright. Hey!"
"Squidward"," Typical."
"Patrick"," You did it wrong, Squidward."
"Squidward","  I did it exactly the way you did it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Everybody pipe down!!! I don't wanna hear another peep from anyone until we get to Food Con!"
"SpongeBob"," Peep!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not a peep!"
"SpongeBob"," Peep!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not a peep!"
"SpongeBob"," Peep! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?  Blink if you're alive."
"SpongeBob"," Whew! Thank Neptune, we're ok!"
"Squidward"," Well, at least we have plenty of food while we're stuck out here."
"Patrick","  It was an accident that it fell into my mouth!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, guys. We can still win Food Con. There's one patty left."
"Mr. Krabs"," We gotta get movin'! The judgin' starts tomorrow! Now, since you boys caused the accident, you'll be haulin' the trailer."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, are you ok? "
"Patrick"," 100%."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, we've got to stop for the night if you want SpongeBob and Patrick to live! I'm not saying that's what I want, I'm just telling you the facts."
"SpongeBob"," We must guard this last patty with our very lives! It's the only way to win Food Con! And who knows what scary, hungry things are out there in the woods waiting to gobble it up!"
"SpongeBob"," Positions everyone!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww. Hey, little fella."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what are we gonna do?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't eat my patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you've saved the Krabby Patty!"
"Squidward"," Whoopee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe I could just eat a pickle."
"Squidward"," Maybe I could just eat the corner of the lettuce."
"Patrick"," I don't wanna be a hog. I'll just eat what's leftover."
"SpongeBob"," No, we can't do that! I know we're all hungry, but we must stay focused! Remember Food Con! Remember the cornucopia!"
"Mr. Krabs","  He says ""Food Con"". But all I hear is ""food""."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob. You look tired. You want me to guard the patty for a bit?"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks, Patrick. That'll be great."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no!"
"Patrick"," I can't believe you thought I would eat it!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you. I'm just hungry and tired and I feel like I'm all alone doing the right thing and I..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," But I'm hungry!"
"Patrick"," Ow! "
"Squidward"," I'll lure him to sleep with a lovely lullaby."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, good idea. Music soothes the savage beast."
"Squidward"," What the? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Did I say ""soothe""? I guess I meant enrages."
"Squidward"," Everybody's a critic."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey there, boy-oh! I've taken the liberty of creatin' a safe to secure our precious patty."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Just put in right in here. I'll even step away while you do it."
"SpongeBob"," Pew, it smells really bad in there."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ok, just do it already!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Enough of this! I am your boss and I order you to give me that patty!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs! I will not! But I will give you these."
"SpongeBob"," Nature Patties!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy!"
"Squidward"," How delightful!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Dig in, boys!"
"Squidward"," Oh! It's like eating the inside of a lawn mower!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I think mine is mostly stones!"
"SpongeBob","  Out here, we call them forest tomatoes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Enough of this! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, remember Food Con!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You can't win Food Con if you starve to death! Now, give me that Krabby Patty boy-oh!"
"SpongeBob"," No! I'm doing this for your own good! I'm protecting you all from yourselves!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, in that case, you leave me no choice. Get him!!!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeow!!"
"Patrick"," Hunger!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi."
"SpongeBob"," What about Food Con?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe you're right."
"SpongeBob","  Yes, a sandwich has no reason to lie."
"SpongeBob","  No! I made a vow! I will not eat you!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Shh! Shh! I hear him over there! He's arguing with the patty! Get him!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't let him get away!"
"SpongeBob"," What?  Food Con!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get him!"
"SpongeBob"," Guys, we're here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry!"
"SpongeBob"," You're all not eating the patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Please! Try a delicious Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  Nature Patty?!"
"Patrick","  Mmm! Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, excuse me, sir. That's not the real Krabby..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Put your truth in, boy! We won!"
"Patrick"," The Krabby Patty won! It won! "
"Squidward"," Yes!"
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," All alone? No one to talk to? Why not write to a total stranger? Connect with other Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Pen Pals Today! Oh, I've never had a pen pal!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... ""Dear Pen Pal, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants..."" Oh, that's great! ""I work at a restaurant. I love frying and I'm very good at it. Sincerely, your new best friend!"" Behold, the perfect letter! Now for the envelope."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, get off of that! You'll spot my masterpiece!"
"SpongeBob"," Nah, it's just a little slime."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, perfect!"
"SpongeBob"," ""Dear SpongeBob, Wow! You know how to fly?"" Fly? What does he mean by... "
"SpongeBob"," Gary, my pen pal thinks I can fly!"
"SpongeBob"," Ha! What a silly misunderstanding. ""I can't believe I know a real life pilot! I wish I could watch you fly, because I am dying!""  Dying?! Not Pen Pal! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't want to let him down and say that I can't fly! 'Cause then, his dying wish will never come true!"
"SpongeBob"," Time to make Pen Pal's wish come true with a tiny white lie!"
"SpongeBob"," ""Dearest Pen Pal, yes, I can fly! Boy, do I love flying! Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!"""
"SpongeBob"," ""Dear SpongeBob, I'll be at the Bikini Bottom Air Show tomorrow. Please meet me there so I can finally see you fly?!""  Oh no! What have I done? What have I done? What have I done? I can't fly, Gary! I'm not a flier! I'm a liar!"
"SpongeBob"," Good thinking, Gary.  Sandy will know just what to do."
"Sandy"," What can I do ya for, SquarePants?"
"SpongeBob"," I did a bad thing, Sandy! I did a very bad thing!"
"Sandy"," Here. Take these. They're clean."
"SpongeBob"," No, no. It's not that. It's... it's..."
"SpongeBob"," I lied!  I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied! "
"Sandy"," Relax, SpongeBob. You're twitchin' like a prairie dog on a cow-skin rug."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, what on a which?"
"Sandy"," What's got your behind a-buzzin'?"
"SpongeBob"," By who I've a where's in?"
"Sandy","  What did you lie about, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, there was this big misunderstanding and now my pen pal thinks I can fly! And I don't think I ever mean it, but now I have to! He doesn't see me fly and I don't know how! If I don't fly, he'll die disappointed! I made a horrible mistake, Sandy! Please help!"
"Sandy"," Well, it ain't no lie if you actually learn how to fly. And I can help you with that!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Sandy"," Sure."
"SpongeBob"," Seatbelt, check. Controls, check."
"Sandy"," Proper take off, check. How are ya doing in there?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm good."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, there's my house!"
"SpongeBob"," Oop. I've forgot to feed Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi Gary."
"Sandy","  Failed. Alright, let's try that again! SpongeBob? Hmm?"
"Sandy"," Alright, SpongeBob. I tied ya up to a rope so you won't be able to go too far off course."
"Sandy"," Contact!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm doing it! I'm actually doing it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Did I do it?"
"Sandy"," Hmm. Good enough."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you must be Pen Pal!"
"SpongeBob"," What an honor it is to finally meet you! Oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you."
"SpongeBob"," I just wanted to say that today... Today...  ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you."" Oh, I will not let you down."
"SpongeBob"," My heart is full too, Pen Pal.  My heart is full too."
"SpongeBob"," Take off. Don't die. Fly a few seconds lower to the ground. Don't die. Slam. Don't die. So simple."
"Sandy"," Get outta here, Steve!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, I'm nervous."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's still not that."
"Sandy"," Don't worry, SpongeBob. You'll be, uh, just fine. Yeah."
"Sandy"," Get ready, boys! The bronco is loose! I repeat, the bronco is loose!"
"SpongeBob","  Just fine."
"SpongeBob"," Pen Pal, this one's for you."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo! I'm flying! Yee-haw!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob! I can't believe you can actually fly like you said in your letter!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? You're Pen Pal?"
"Patrick","  Duh! "
"SpongeBob"," But... but you said you were dying! You're not dying!"
"Patrick"," Dying? Oh, oh! You didn't read the whole letter!"
"SpongeBob","  See? It says, ""I wish I could watch you fly because I am dying!"""
"Patrick","  And here's the second page! ""To see you as a real pilot, SpongeBob. Here are some other things I like to see candy rain, a firetruck full of clowns, and... a bunch of other stuff."""
"SpongeBob"," It all makes sense now!  Oh, Patrick! "
"Patrick","  You thought I was dying!"
"Patrick"," Watch out!"
"Patrick"," Candy rain, check!"
"Patrick"," Firetruck clowns, check!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me!"
"Patrick"," Fly first class, check!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, something's wrong with the plane! Here, take the controls!"
"Patrick"," Take what now?"
"Patrick"," Whoo-hoo! Check and check!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Patrick. Who's flying the plane?!"
"Patrick"," I am!"
"Patrick"," No, wait."
"SpongeBob"," Hold on! We're going down!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew! We ran out of gas."
"Patrick"," Uh, don't worry! I've got this!  Yep!"
"Patrick"," Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it was my pleasure."
"Patrick"," Really? Well, if you don't mind, I have a couple of other things I'd like to see. "
"SpongeBob"," Let's hear 'em."
"Patrick","  ""An edible balloon, a skateboarding snail, a tower of loose meat that tastes like ice cream, some ghosts..."""
"Plankton"," I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?"
"Plankton"," Say what?"
"Plankton"," That formula will be mine!"
"Plankton","  Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it!  Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!"
"Plankton"," That's right, everyone. Gather in real close.  Time to trigger the stench!  Yoink!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  No, no, no, no, no, no!"
"SpongeBob"," Not the patties! I'll save you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's all the racket out here?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know. Me eyes were burnin'! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  Plankton!  He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it!  He could be reading it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Give me your hand, boy-oh!  I need to borrow this.  Ok, I'm going in!"
"SpongeBob"," Good luck, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why you little..."
"Plankton"," I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo! "
"Plankton"," What? The old safe in the safe routine?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!"
"Plankton"," I'm not hungry!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eww.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. I see the problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks like I'm gonna have to beef up security around here."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddie."
"Mr. Krabs","  Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate."
"Mr. Krabs","  He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!"
"Plankton","  Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there! "
"Plankton"," Hey, there."
"Plankton"," Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie."
"Plankton"," Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula.  Hair! Hair! I gotta go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton."
"Plankton"," Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place."
"SpongeBob","  Okay, bye!"
"SpongeBob"," Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula."
"SpongeBob"," Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Gary!"
"Plankton"," Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob..  I mean your master at home?  Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products."
"Plankton"," Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys..."
"Plankton"," My leg!"
"Plankton"," Your friends won't tell ya this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, Smelly!"
"Plankton"," Hello, sir...  Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors."
"Plankton"," How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them.  If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help."
"Plankton","  Note to self Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract. "
"Plankton"," I forgot how much I hate pineapple."
"Plankton","  Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple.  Now, where is that secret formula?"
"Plankton"," Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere."
"Plankton"," Nothin' in there.  Ooh, look at that."
"Plankton"," Hello!"
"Plankton"," Where the barnacles is it?"
"Plankton"," Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not foolin' anybody! I went to college!"
"Plankton"," Nope, nope, nope."
"Plankton"," Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!"
"Plankton"," Put 'em up! Put 'em up!"
"Plankton"," Of course! What a fool I've been!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh?  Aye yae yae!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, I'm home!"
"SpongeBob"," What happened here?  My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren!  My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times!  My glass of water!  I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew! It's safe and right where I left it."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, did you do this?"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?"
"SpongeBob"," Something's not right, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," I'd better get you to the vet."
"Plankton"," Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!"
"Plankton"," Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell.  What's that?  This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!"
"Plankton"," The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's Plankton."
"SpongeBob"," Looks like one of my old grocery lists."
"Plankton"," Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!"
"Plankton"," I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!"
"Sandy"," Hmm?  Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again."
"Plankton","  I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!"
"Sandy"," You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick."
"Plankton","  Yes.  Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick! "
"Plankton"," One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it."
"Plankton"," Nagging Neptune!  Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!"
"Plankton"," Sweet gashes molasses!"
"Plankton"," I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce.  But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus."
"Plankton"," Idiot sauce!  I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?"
"Plankton"," Leave me be woman!"
"Plankton"," Oh no."
"Squidward"," I've got the best taste in town! Duh! "
"Sandy"," I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones."
"Sandy"," What happened to your head, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, me make Krabby Patties."
"Sandy"," Uh, that's mud."
"Sandy"," Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?"
"Patrick"," I don't understand the question."
"Sandy"," What in Sam Hill?"
"Sandy"," Hey, don't do that!"
"Sandy"," Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero."
"Sandy","  Zero as being everyone's collected by goo."
"Sandy"," And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy."
"Plankton"," You not Plankton! Me Plankton! "
"Sandy"," Bright."
"Sandy"," Nuts?"
"Sandy"," Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change? "
"Sandy"," Wise up!"
"Sandy"," No things!"
"Sandy","  That gives me an idea."
"Sandy"," Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up all you morons! Classes are now beginning!"
"Sandy"," Aww! This isn't working!"
"Sandy"," Good mornin', students."
"Sandy"," A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us."
"Sandy"," And don't forget your last homework assignment!"
"Sandy"," Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well."
"Plankton","  Yeah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," School is dumb? You've misspelled every word."
"Plankton"," Shut up, dweeb!"
"Plankton"," Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!"
"Plankton"," I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Plankton, can I come out now?"
"Plankton"," Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn."
"Plankton"," I'll never learn!"
"Plankton"," Not again!"
"Sandy"," This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet."
"SpongeBob"," Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula!  Yes! That's it!"
"SpongeBob"," Great! Well, see ya out there."
"Plankton"," Somethin' smells good!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?"
"Plankton"," It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon.  Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, please! Not that! Anything but that!"
"Plankton"," Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.  Let me have that diploma!"
"Patrick"," Uh, hey. No running in the halls!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go, Plankton."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, your diploma!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!"
"Plankton"," What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!"
"Plankton"," But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!"
"Sandy"," Excellent, Mr. Krabs!  Here's your final grade for acting class. A+.  I've really felt the fear."
"Plankton"," Wait, what?! Acting class?!  No!!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You've finally been schooled, drop-out!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, rip current, schmip current! Ain't nothin'."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Mr. Krabs, do you think the rip current will hit the Krusty Krab?"
"Squidward"," Uh, shouldn't we clear the docks? Or batten down the patches? Or whatever people say?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Calm your waters.  Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," As soon as you buy some patties to go, you can go."
"Mr. Krabs"," No takie-backsies! Three Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs","  Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen up, everybody! New store policy! All money brought into this store must be spent here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, tyrant am I? Alright, I'm a tyrant! The worst in all the seven seas! One of 'em! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, why is Mr. Krabs so crabby today?"
"Squidward"," Probably because it's pay day."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pay day's been canceled! Now, hear this! I'm captain of the ship! Captain Krabs! And I say no rip current will ever harm the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Darn arthritis!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, while I steer you tell everyone we're safe."
"Squidward","  It's alright now, everybody! Everything's under control now! And whatever!"
"SpongeBob"," Congratulations, Squidward! Uh, I mean Captain Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the meanin' of this?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Captain Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's put the past behind us and start all over!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This is mutiny! Listen here, Squidward! Fun is fun, but get me outta here!"
"Squidward"," Sorry. I don't think that's the captain's job. You're on your own."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, everybody, can we take a time out? This is Mr. Krabs we're talking about. The worst tyrant in the seven seas."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're not helpin', boy."
"SpongeBob"," You remember Mr. Krabs. He's the man who brought you the Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," And he's the man who brought you the Double Krabby Patty. And the Krabby Patty with cheese. And the Bratty Patty for kids."
"Mr. Krabs"," Um, little help here!"
"SpongeBob"," He also created the Chatty Patty for teens. And who can forget the Hatty Patty. The patty you wear as a hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! Man overboard! "
"SpongeBob"," NO! MR. KRABS!"
"Squidward"," Well, I guess that solves that problem."
"SpongeBob"," I know you'll come back to us, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Until then,  I'll leave a dollar in the window for ya."
"Squidward"," Uh, uh, don't be hasty! Remember, I'm... I'm still the captain! The Hatty Patty was my idea!"
"Squidward"," Oh, barnacles!"
"Squidward"," Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Where are we?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm calling the local Krusty Krab right now."
"Squidward"," Hello, Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, I'd like to place an order."
"SpongeBob","  Captain Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, I know where he is."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them."
"Squidward"," Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm afraid the crew insists, sir."
"Squidward"," I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, somebody has to step up, fight that monster, and become captain! And that somebody is me!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what was I doing now?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you're alive! Oh, welcome back, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, uh. The monster ate him. We need a captain and that's you! Isn't that right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And that's comin' out of your pay!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, this job calls for a dictator like you!"
"SpongeBob"," Do something, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Beg me."
"SpongeBob"," We're begging you! Please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not buyin' it."
"SpongeBob"," Got it!  Do you know what this is, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't care."
"SpongeBob"," It's the first dime you ever earned and I'm going to tear it up if you don't go back to being the meanie we need!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I said I don't care."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, here goes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! You lose!"
"SpongeBob"," Well then, I'm gonna do the worst thing I can do to your old dime!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh yeah? What's that?"
"SpongeBob","  Spend it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no you don't! Come here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, everybody! What am I?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on! It starts with a T!"
"SpongeBob"," A tree?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't hear you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Correct! Alright, I'll save ya. But you gotta promise to spend most of your, all of your money right here! Got it?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hold on to me dime, boy-yo."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute! Gimme that!"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Mr. Krabs. You earned it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, boy-yo, you believed in me. So, today will be a pay day for you."
"Squidward"," What about me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You, Ex-Captain Squidward, have gone from pay day to mayday! Mush! Every last one of ya! All the way back to Bikini Bottom! "
"SpongeBob"," Mmm! Isn't this salt water taffy just tafflicious?"
"Patrick"," Mmm! Stickerific!"
"Patrick"," Oww!"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," I have a headache inside of my tooth!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe you should do something about that."
"Patrick"," Okay, I will!"
"SpongeBob"," How does that help?"
"Patrick"," Well, now that my all over hurts, I'm not thinking about my mouth.  Ow! I guess that didn't work!"
"SpongeBob"," That's it! I'm taking you to the dentist, Patrick."
"Patrick"," No way! I've heard horror stories!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry, Patrick. Dentists are our friends.  Huh? Patrick? Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you!"
"Patrick"," Aww, darn it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Aren't dentist offices fun?  Oh, they've got colorful wooden beads on wires!  Whoa, look at it go!"
"Patrick"," Slow down, SpongeBob! This place is scary enough without you going crazy with the beads!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, come on, Patrick.  The doctor will fix you right up."
"Patrick"," No problem. I was just leaving."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick! Sit!"
"SpongeBob"," Good boy. Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I wanna see!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww. Coochie coo!"
"Patrick"," I still have a baby tooth?"
"Patrick","  That's not right!"
"Patrick"," You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, come back!"
"Patrick"," Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island."
"Patrick"," Tooth Island?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows."
"SpongeBob"," Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can bee free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities."
"SpongeBob"," Of course, I guess your baby tooth could be happy in your mouth all alone by itself."
"Patrick"," I don't care, SpongeBob! I know what's best for my tooth! I can make it happy."
"Patrick"," ♪Rock a bye baby on the treetop♪"
"Patrick"," Oops."
"Patrick"," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. My friendship sense is tingling. Patrick must be in trouble."
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, pal?"
"Patrick","  Nothing! Just, uh, practicing being a seal! "
"Patrick"," Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says, ""If you can't bite, things ain't right."""
"Patrick"," Okay, SpongeBob. I guess I have to get my tooth to the Tooth Fairy."
"Squidward"," Ha! You rube. There's no such thing as a Tooth Fairy."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Squidward"," It's all a bunch of made up baloney."
"SpongeBob"," It is not baloney!"
"Squidward"," It is baloney!"
"Patrick"," Who's got baloney?"
"Squidward","  There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, why would you want to do that?"
"Squidward"," I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy."
"Patrick"," That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage."
"SpongeBob"," You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out."
"Patrick"," You'll have to catch me first!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, wait!"
"Squidward"," Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!"
"Patrick"," The worms!"
"Patrick"," Not wanted. That fixes it."
"Patrick"," You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, they weren't mine."
"Patrick"," A likely story!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, can I show you something?"
"Patrick"," What's that?"
"SpongeBob"," It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth.  Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart."
"Patrick","  I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?"
"Patrick"," Okay, SpongeBob. We can go."
"Patrick"," I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do."
"Patrick"," That's it?"
"Patrick"," You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"Squidward","  Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!"
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you don't understand! I'm just helping to get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy!"
"Squidward"," Oh, that's a good one."
"SpongeBob"," It's true!"
"Patrick"," How can I believe you? All the lies!  The chicanery! "
"Squidward","  Look at how betrayed Patrick feels! Oh, this was totally worth staying up all night."
"SpongeBob"," You don't believe there's a Tooth Fairy? Well, follow me and I'll show ya."
"SpongeBob"," Behold, the Tooth Ferry!"
"SpongeBob"," This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island."
"Patrick"," There really is a Tooth Ferry!"
"SpongeBob"," Of course."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, here. This is yours."
"Patrick"," Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?"
"SpongeBob"," Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal."
"Patrick"," Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?"
"Squidward"," Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!"
"SpongeBob"," Open wide, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Your turn. "
"Patrick"," Now you. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Yes, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with...  two sticks?"
"Patrick"," Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing ""Stick in a Cup."""
"SpongeBob"," Free my mind! Free my mind! Free my mind! "
"SpongeBob"," I want it!"
"Patrick"," No, I want it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I want it!"
"Patrick"," No, I want it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's mine!"
"Patrick"," I want it! I want it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's mine!"
"Patrick"," Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain."
"SpongeBob"," Step one...  Oh, I see what to do."
"SpongeBob","  It's just me, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Now, you do me!"
"Patrick"," Boo!"
"SpongeBob"," It's time to free our minds!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angel before!"
"Patrick","  And the propeller tickles my think folds!  Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!"
"SpongeBob"," Eye bump!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?"
"Patrick","  I feel you."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. I know who we can spy on. "
"Squidward","  The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can...  let it all hang out.  Me... "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where's Squidward? I'm sure I saw him in here."
"Patrick"," Well, maybe he fell in the toilet. I'll check!"
"Patrick"," Squidward, are you in here? Did you fall in? Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Stop serenading me, you sap! It's my day off! Now, go away!"
"SpongeBob"," Found him!"
"Patrick"," Yep, that's him! Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Aliens from Mars! It's an invasion!"
"Patrick"," She spit in his face! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mrs. Puff, we've been dating for 16 years now. So, I was sincerely hoping that today might finally be the day that..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Can I steal a little kiss?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come here, you."
"Mr. Krabs"," What a woman!"
"Patrick"," I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!"
"Patrick"," Get ready, get set, punch it!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what's going on? Everything went dark! Uh, Patrick, can you see anything?"
"Patrick"," Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!"
"Patrick","  M-O-O-N.  That spells moon! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!"
"Patrick"," I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy! "
"Patrick"," Here, brains!"
"SpongeBob"," Brainy, where are you?"
"Patrick"," Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I've found mine too!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, darn it. I still can't see."
"Patrick"," Yeah, my brain won't fit back in."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something."
"Patrick"," I'll take it!"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah! Lookin' good!"
"SpongeBob"," Ew! Give me that!"
"Patrick"," Aww, man! That felt all squishy! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy."
"Patrick"," Okay. SANDY!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, I meant on the phone."
"Sandy","  Hello?"
"Sandy"," Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things."
"Sandy"," And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds.  Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house."
"Sandy"," Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?"
"Sandy"," We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!"
"Sandy"," This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in..."
"Sandy","  Hey, fellas! I think I've found your brains!"
"Sandy"," Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!"
"Sandy"," Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room."
"SpongeBob"," Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again! "
"Sandy"," Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll..."
"Sandy"," Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Sandy"," I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," My think is clogged."
"Sandy"," Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today."
"Squidward"," The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! YOU'RE NEXT!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," To the Invisible Boatmobile!"
"Patrick"," Yay!"
"SpongeBob"," This must be the secret lair of an evil villain!"
"Patrick"," You're right!"
"SpongeBob"," Looks like there's evil afoot!"
"SpongeBob","  And littering is a crime."
"Squidward"," What? I thought I had my house sponge and star proofed!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward. Wanna play Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy with us?"
"Squidward"," NO! Now please fall and get seriously hurt!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sure I've heard that ""no"" before."
"Patrick"," Only something, Mermaid Man! You can't mean..."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, my young pink ward. It's none other than..."
"SpongeBob"," Doctor Negative!"
"Squidward","  ♪I hate SpongeBob and I hate Patrick...♪"
"SpongeBob"," It's that denying desperado's siren song!"
"Squidward"," ♪Loathing SpongeBob. Scorning Patrick. La, la, la, la, la, la.♪"
"SpongeBob"," He's obviously raising an army of mutant vegetables. And that song he's singing will..."
"SpongeBob"," Although our foes were evil, their nutrition did not go to waste, Doctor Negative."
"Patrick"," We're watching you!"
"Squidward"," That's it! I'm gonna clobber you two!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, do you hear that? You'd better hurry up or you'll be late for work."
"Patrick","  Yeah. You'd better do something or whatever."
"Patrick"," ♪Mermaid Man, our hero! Barnacle Boy, you too!♪"
"SpongeBob","  ♪Mermaid Man, crime-fighter! Barnacle Boy, makes do!♪"
"Patrick"," ♪Evil found its match today! Underwater justice and fair play!♪"
"Squidward"," Will you two shut up about that stupid show?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, did you say something negative, Doctor Negative?"
"Squidward"," What the? How did..."
"Patrick"," I heard him say something negative!"
"Patrick"," Mermaid Man, that injured victim's bandages have come undone!"
"SpongeBob"," That poor man needs aid!"
"SpongeBob"," Of the first variety."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! We've forgot the peroxide."
"SpongeBob"," That should hold you until your surgeons can amputate our torso."
"Squidward"," Hey, Superdorks! Your turn to take out the garbage."
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Doctor Negative. We'll play along and take it out. Hiya!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Why are all my tables empty? Why am I not makin' money?"
"Squidward"," Because these two costume creeps chased them out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello?  Mr. Squidward, step into me office."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh, Patrick. I think we got Squidward in trouble."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna share a secret with you that I never told anyone."
"Squidward"," Uh, that's okay. I don't need to hear. Uh..."
"Squidward"," Hmm?"
"Squidward","  You're a comic book geek!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't touch those! They're mint condition... worth a fortune!"
"Squidward"," So you read comics. Don't worry. Lots of perfectly immature adults read comics."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, it's deeper than that."
"Mr. Krabs"," I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood."
"Squidward"," Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on."
"Mr. Krabs"," I have some fabric leftover. So, I made this."
"Squidward"," Oh, don't tell me. Doctor Negative?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tremble before Captain Tightwad!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  And cower in fear of Doctor Negative."
"SpongeBob"," Holy Shrimp! This is the best day of my life!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you waiting for?"
"SpongeBob"," Why are we fighting Captain Tightwad? He didn't even commit a crime."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wha... What do ya mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs. It's right here in Mermaid Man Number 98. ""No superhero shall fight a super villain until that super villain has committed a crime."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Arr... Uh... Hey!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! See? I just stole some money!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's not really stealing if it's your own money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, come on! What do... What do I have to do here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure about this? Isn't robbing a bank against the law?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, yes Mr. Krabs. But you're not really robbing a bank, you're just pretending to."
"Mr. Krabs"," And then we can play?"
"SpongeBob"," Yep!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, okay."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahoy! Anyone home? It's Captain Tightwad and Doctor Negative! We're here to rob ya! Anyone here? No."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah! Thanks old timer! Um, we're pretending to rob this bank. Where's the tellers? Where's the money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! You were so convincing! You had that guard totally fooled! I think we should skip to the end of the story. Let's just stop here and pick up some props for your evil lair. We'll just need a few dollars."
"SpongeBob"," Boink!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm supposed to be the villain, but why do I feel like I'm being robbed?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Captain Tightwad! Doctor Negative, you can come out now!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, so here's the scene. You two have us here in this cage over a pool of boiling oil. Now that is a crime. Now, you can let us out so we can fight."
"Squidward"," Oh, I don't think we're going to do that."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, wha... what are you doing?"
"Squidward"," Being evil. Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you scared? Boo-hoo?"
"SpongeBob"," Boo-hoo? Do you expect us to cry?"
"Squidward"," No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, okay, Squidward. Playtime's over. This is getting a little intense here."
"Squidward"," Too long have I suffered living between you two ninnies! But now, now as Doctor Negative, I shall finally exact my exquisite revenge! "
"SpongeBob"," See? I just knew we'd make a terrific bad guy. He is really committing."
"Patrick"," You did a great job with casting."
"SpongeBob"," Swing, Boy Yonder! Swing the basket!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy, Mr. Krabs! That was the best Mermaid Man playdate ever!"
"Patrick"," Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Maybe I'll just stick to reading comics from now on."
"SpongeBob","  Sorry about this, barnacles, but it's spring cleaning time. "
"Squidward"," There, my masterpiece.  What the—ah!"
"Squidward"," Ah, perfect.  No!  What is that menace up to now?  How many— "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Whoa!"
"Squidward"," Will you please turn that thing— "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," What are you saying?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't hear you over the hose noise. Hold on, I'll turn it off. "
"SpongeBob"," What'd you want to tell me, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Turn off the hose."
"SpongeBob"," I already did. Here, I'll turn it back on just for you."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, wait— "
"SpongeBob"," Yep, it was off. How'd I do?"
"Squidward"," Horrible! Everything you do is horrible! I wish you would just move away already."
"SpongeBob"," Move away? But Squidward, I like it—  Did you see that? Huh, I wonder what's making me sneeze."
"Squidward","  Ahh!  Probably all the barnacle dust you kicked up."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, that makes no sense. Who ever heard of dust making you sneeze?"
"Squidward"," Oh, fine, maybe you're allergic to your pineapple."
"SpongeBob","  You can't be allergic to a house.  Or could you—no. "
"Squidward","  Oh, why do I even bother trying to explain things to him? Of course you can be allergic to a house. I ju— wait. You can be allergic to a house. "
"Squidward"," Gary, no, no, no, no! "
"SpongeBob","  Aw, playtime, that's nice."
"Squidward"," Not the face! "
"SpongeBob"," Good morn—  good mor—  good—  Good morning, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Squidward"," You okay in there, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, morning—  Morning, Squidwa— "
"Squidward"," Oh my, having a little sneezing fit are we?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, I think you were right. I must be allergic to my house. "
"Squidward"," Oh, that's too bad. I guess you'll have to move."
"SpongeBob"," Move?"
"Squidward"," Yes. You can't stay here or your allergy will just get worse.  Hey, look at that."
"SpongeBob"," Look at what?"
"Squidward"," See? Your allergy is already getting worse."
"SpongeBob"," But—but where will I go?"
"Squidward"," Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll help you find a great new home... far away from here."
"SpongeBob"," But, Squidward, I love this old pineapple. We've had a lot of good times together."
"SpongeBob"," Whee!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward, my sneezing is getting worse. I'll miss my pineapple, but I guess you're right. I ha—  I have to move."
"Squidward"," Now you're talking. Trust me, you'll feel so much better when you're clear of me—  ...your pineapple."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you're a good friend."
"Squidward"," I know. "
"Squidward"," This would make a great new house, what do you think?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm..."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know."
"Squidward"," How about this spicy number?"
"SpongeBob"," Hot listing, but no."
"Squidward"," Well, there's a yummy one."
"SpongeBob"," Mmm."
"SpongeBob"," Nope."
"Squidward"," How 'bout this one?"
"SpongeBob"," Not bad, but let's think outside the box. "
"Squidward"," Okay, so that's a no. I think I know what you're looking for."
"Squidward"," How about this for space?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what's this lever do? "
"SpongeBob","  Automatic balconies!  Squidward, watch this!"
"Squidward"," Wait, wait, no, no, no! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, this is great. What does this button do?  That's what it does."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, why couldn't I live in that last place?"
"Squidward"," Oh, that house was too dangerous for you.  Ow. Besides, it was just a house. But this is a castle with a moat and everything."
"SpongeBob"," It's a long way from Bikini Bottom."
"Squidward"," I know."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," I mean, don't worry about it. It's a short 11-hour commute to the Krusty Krab from here."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't know, Squidward. It doesn't seem like the safest neighborhood."
"Squidward"," All right, SpongeBob, this is the last house on my list, but I think it's got everything you're looking for. What do you think?"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know. It doesn't look like much."
"SpongeBob"," Pretty!"
"Squidward"," This place is amazing.  It's like living in the future."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, check out these cool stairs.  Whee!"
"Squidward"," Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Whee! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Squidward?  This place is awesome!"
"Squidward","  Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe I get to live here. It's so much cooler than your house."
"Squidward"," You're right. This place is way too cool for you."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, what?"
"Squidward"," I mean, living in a place like this can put a lot of pressure on a guy. The constant attention you get, and all the fabulous parties you'd host. "
"Squidward"," Eh?"
"Squidward"," Not to mention all the covers of ""Cool Calamari"" you'd have to pose for.  No, I can't let you go through that, SpongeBob. So I tell you what, I'll live here for you."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but where will I live?"
"Squidward"," You can have my old house."
"SpongeBob"," Really? That is so nice of you. That way, I'll be one house closer to Patrick."
"Squidward"," Great, it's a done deal. So if you don't mind, I have a lot of settling in to do.  Bye-bye."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, so I guess I'll see you la— "
"Squidward","  Now this is how I was always meant to live.  Bedtime.  Oh, a built in alarm clock. Hoo, this place has got it all. "
"Squidward","  Huh? Wha—what's happening?"
"Squidward"," Oh, no. It's not an alarm clock. It's a countdown!"
"Squidward"," Huh? What—What the—uh. That was horrible.  But this is even worse! "
"SpongeBob","  Doink! Now this really feels like home."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you dropped in for a visit."
"Squidward"," I am not visiting. This is my house and I want it back. "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Squidward, but you gave it to me fair and square... pants.  Besides, if I move out now, I have no where to go."
"Squidward"," Okay, fine, I'll just take your old pineapple. Huh? "
"Patrick"," Sorry, Squidward, but this is my house now. "
"Squidward"," Well, then, where am I supposed to live?"
"SpongeBob"," Night, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Ow."
"Squidward"," Maybe I'll do a cute little button.  Or something a bit more manly perhaps.  Upturned might be good, too. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Great.  The idiot found me."
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha doing?"
"Squidward"," I'm picking a nose."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out."
"Squidward"," I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with."
"SpongeBob","  But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a...  Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?"
"Squidward"," With you? Absolutely not."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, come on, Squidward.  I can get you there lickety-split."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in."
"Squidward","  Ah. This is nice."
"SpongeBob"," Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help."
"Squidward","  The bed is fine!"
"SpongeBob"," Fluff your pillow?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Fluff your IV bag?"
"Squidward"," Enough, you buffoon!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful."
"Squidward","  If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo!  Ooh! Candy stripes.  Strawberry."
"SpongeBob"," Wait a second! I think I've seen this before.  Mm, yeah.  Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken."
"SpongeBob"," You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys."
"SpongeBob"," No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help."
"SpongeBob"," Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time.  Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Ready, set. "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine. "
"SpongeBob"," Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes. "
"SpongeBob"," Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day.  Let's get medical."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no."
"SpongeBob"," Me? Perform a surgery?"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah, this is the life. And best of all, there's no SpongeBob here to ruin it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob? No! What are you doing here?"
"Squidward"," Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, everybody."
"SpongeBob","  Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew.  Here we go!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and—  no! Shoot!  Son of a gun!  Ah, my bad."
"SpongeBob"," Ah-ha!  Mmm, sushi."
"SpongeBob"," He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job."
"SpongeBob"," Oh,  Thank you! Let's try again, shall we?"
"SpongeBob"," Order up!"
"SpongeBob"," Yow! That shouldn't be in there.  Ooh! "
"SpongeBob"," Ta-da!"
"SpongeBob"," Nurse, sponge."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, nurse."
"SpongeBob"," Ta-da!"
"SpongeBob"," There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse."
"Squidward","  What—what happened?"
"SpongeBob"," I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!"
"Squidward"," Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—"
"Squidward"," No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No-o-o-o! "
"Squidward"," Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—"
"SpongeBob"," How's about the Squidward Classic?"
"Squidward"," Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it."
"SpongeBob"," D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work. "
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm just a fry cook.  But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye! "
"Squidward"," Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Krusty crew, I want to remind you all that you're representing the Krusty Krab—the greasiest greasy spoon you'll ever have the privilege of serving!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! You tell 'em, Mr. Krabs!  Bring it around town! Yeah!"
"Squidward","  Bring it around somewhere!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Open the doors and let the consuming commence! I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty. "
"Squidward","  ""I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty."" "
"Mr. Krabs"," I heard that, Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was a—a—a—a tribute. Haven't you ever heard of ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery""?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You trying to tell me that was a ""complement""?"
"Squidward"," Exactly. It's my homage to you and your love for money."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, you got me there. I do love money.  Excellent observation, Mr. Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy, that was a close one."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, it was a very close one, Squidward. Close and warm.  Mr. Krabs was really flattered by your imitation."
"Squidward"," Already forgot about it."
"SpongeBob"," Imitation plus flattery equals happy people. "
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, okay now. Everybody, settle down, time to eat your patties.  Huh?"
"Squidward"," Hurry up, SpongeBob, I need two orders of Krabby Krust stat."
"SpongeBob"," No problem, Squidward, I'll get you those orders as soon as possible."
"SpongeBob","  Or never, whichever comes first."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, swoon. That imitation stuff really works. Look out, world!  I'm gonna flatter your socks off! "
"Patrick"," Hmm. Nope.  Ah."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, there, Patrick old buddy."
"Patrick"," What? Oh, hi, Patrick. What's shaking?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm gonna eat ice cream and go jellyfishing with my good buddy, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Sounds good to me, ""me."""
"SpongeBob"," Ah, it's just me, Patrick! Fooled ya! "
"Patrick","  You can't fool me, ""me."" That's the worst SpongeBob impression I've ever seen."
"SpongeBob","  Wait, what?"
"Plankton"," Rook to king four."
"Plankton"," Check-mate..."
"Sandy"," Plankton, maybe we should play a game that's a little less dangerous. You're flatter than hammered horse hockey."
"SpongeBob","  Cattywampus, Plankton. You're just about the teeniest gal-dang critter I ever did see. Yee-haw!"
"SpongeBob","  And you are the fuzziest nut-eating scientist I've ever seen. "
"SpongeBob","  I like to use science for good."
"SpongeBob","  Really? I always use science for evil!"
"Sandy","  That is me to a Texas ""T,"" SpongeBob! He nailed you too, Plankton!"
"Plankton"," It was okay. He got my face right, but that voice is terrible."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, those impressions are making everyone so happy! I can't stop doing them! I can't..I won't."
"SpongeBob","  80,000 impressions later..."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you want some napkins, please?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, bye. Yup, everybody still loves it. "
"SpongeBob","  Are we having fun yet, Squidward Tentacles? "
"Squidward"," Oh, that's it! I can't stand the perfect impression of me anymore! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm tired of looking at myself. I quit! "
"Sandy"," Boy, SpongeBob is really getting out of control with his impression obsession."
"Sandy"," Ah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right you are, Sandy. SpongeBob has lost touch with reality. I've seen it before. They call it the ""mocking mimicry madness."""
"SpongeBob","  The mocking mimicry madness. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, oh! "
"Sandy"," Huh! Oh."
"Sandy"," All right, remember guys, this is an intervention, so we need to make sure that above all, SpongeBob knows how much we all care about him."
"Plankton"," Why don't we just destroy him and get it over with?"
"Squidward"," Here here."
"Patrick"," You leave my best friend alone!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Spread out! All right, you scurvy dogs, SpongeBob needs us, and more importantly, I need him—to stop imitating me customers!"
"Sandy"," Right guys, that's... almost... the spirit."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy, someone's at the door! I can't wait to imitate 'em!  Oh, hello, Patrick! And Sandy? And Squidward? And Mr. Krabs? Plankton too? Five at once, huh? Okay, here goes nothing."
"SpongeBob","  Hi! Ahoy! Howdy! Greetings! Go away!"
"Patrick","  Why?!"
"Sandy","  Hi, SpongeBob. We need to talk."
"SpongeBob","  Why sure! Aye! Love to! About what? Who cares?"
"Sandy"," You know, it's okay to be yourself, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  I'm-a trying, Sandy, I'm-a trying!"
"Sandy"," You can do it, SpongeBob, just concentrate, and it'll all come back to ya!"
"SpongeBob","  Good morning, Gary! Meow. Duh! Me money!  Karate chop! Ha! I went to college! I said eat your patties!  I can't do it! I'm a freak! A freak!  I'm a freak!"
"Plankton"," Hey!"

"Patrick"," Good, SpongeBob! I had the same answer."
"Sandy","   I know you're in there somewhere, SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," We're sorry, the person you are calling—SpongeBob SquarePants—has been disconnected or is no longer in service."
"Sandy"," Okay, guys, SpongeBob imitates whoever he hears, so we've all got to imitate him to help him remember who he is.  This should help!"

"Mr. Krabs"," That was a pretty good impression, though."
"Plankton","  Thanks."

"SpongeBob"," Nighty-night, Prickles."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"

"SpongeBob"," Ow!  Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, I need to take a shower."

"Patrick","  This isn't my rug! Where—where am I? Who am I?  Who am I?  How am I?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Patrick, calm down! You're at my house! Oh, and that is your rug."
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah.  Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie. Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, time to wake up. Wake up, little Squidward.  Patrick, Squidward won't wake up."
"Patrick"," Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie!  Wake up, little Squidward, wake up!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should get him up."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, this is bad. Squidward won't make his audition with the Philharmonic Orchestra. What can we do?"
"Patrick"," Oh, we'll have to create another Squidward in the lab."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you are a genius!"
"Patrick"," Eureka!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. It didn't work."
"Patrick"," Ooh, we've tried everything under the ocean and we failed! If only we could just crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet."
"SpongeBob"," That's it! We could crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet!"
"Patrick"," Oh, whose dumb idea was that?"
"SpongeBob"," Yours."
"Patrick"," Well, it sounds good to me."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, you go in first and control his arms and legs. Then I'll go in and control the brain."
"Patrick"," Okay."
"Patrick"," Eww.  It tickles."
"SpongeBob"," How's that feel, buddy?"
"Patrick"," Not bad. Okay, get on my shoulders."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna see if I can make Squidward talk."
"SpongeBob","  My name is Squidward, and I think SpongeBob is a lamebrain. "
"Patrick","  Wow, you sound more like him than—than Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Patrick, we've got a date at the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic. Let's get going."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, whoops. Watch out. Take it easy."
"SpongeBob"," Left foot, right foot."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Excuse me. Sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Pardon me."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I just realized I don't know where the concert hall is."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, let's ask someone."
"SpongeBob","  Excuse me, ma'am. I'm looking for the concert hall."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick! That bus is going to the concert hall!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you have any change?"
"Patrick"," One second."
"SpongeBob","  I was just, oh, um,  the thing is not on the thing.  Oh, uh..."
"SpongeBob","  The clarinet, where's his clarinet?"
"Patrick"," Oh, I got it."
"SpongeBob"," Ew, why'd you put it there?"
"Patrick"," I guess I never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it."
"SpongeBob","  Let's see, the ability to play clarinet has got to be in his brain somewhere. It's just a matter of squeezing it out."
"Squidward"," What—what's going on here? Where am I? I'm at the audition. I'm playing, but I'm not in control. I—I feel like I've been taken over by something."
"Patrick"," What's going on?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know what's happening! I'm losing control!"
"Squidward","  Must... gain... control!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't think I can command his brain much longer!"
"Patrick"," Me neither, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," What was that—SpongeBob? Patrick? You're inside me?! Oh, how did this happen? Get out of my mind!"
"Squidward"," Get out of my body! Just—just—just get out!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I am going to lambaste you two!"
"Squidward"," I—huh? Oh."
"Squidward"," I envy you common people. For you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play Gustav Mollusk's Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor. For I am in complete control."
"Squidward"," I cannot believe I let you talk me into this."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward. Catering is a great way for you to make a little extra money. And me to make a lot!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Any ideas?"
"Squidward"," How's that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Perfect, now get out there and feed the rest of those kids."
"Squidward"," They all seem so... full of germs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering? "
"Squidward"," Okay, I'm going in."
"Squidward"," Krabby Patty? Krabby Patty? "
"Squidward"," You're contaminating the food! Just pick one!"
"Squidward","  I've been infected!"
"Patrick"," Hey, kids, I'm a—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, I'm not paying you to play hide-and-seek! These children want to be entertained! Get down here! "
"Patrick"," Uh, um."
"Patrick"," A rock."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piñata, son."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oof!  Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs.  It's the piñata you want, son."
"Mr. Krabs"," Me money! Do I look like a piñata to you, boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Higher! Go higher!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, don't forget to take your shoes off before bouncing."
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Squidward"," We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!"
"Patrick"," They tore off my head."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should make a break for it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, men, let's cheese it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes."
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Indubitably, madam. We are your high-class caterers."
"Mr. Krabs"," Tuxedos? Oh, just give us a moment to suit up, me good lady."
"Squidward"," Now, where are we going to get tuxedos from?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You."
"Squidward"," Hey, what are you—"
"Squidward"," Ew."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ready to serve you, Miss Money Bags—er, I—I mean, ma'am."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, you can't take that check. We're not high-class caterers."
"Mr. Krabs","  We are anything we need to be for me to make this money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Unless you wanna go back to the kids' party."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what I thought. Then start setting up inside."
"Patrick"," This place is so shiny."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, and so are the people."
"Squidward"," Oh, there's no way those people are gonna think our junk food is high class."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm, you might be right. SpongeBob, go find something to fancy-up the food."
"SpongeBob"," Fancy. Got it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good, now I'll just get the lay of the land around here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great Neptune's ghost!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, kid, easy, easy. Just calm down, will ya? I got your cake."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, yeah.  Your birthday cake is right through here. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Won't be seeing him again any time soon."
"SpongeBob"," What do you think of this, Mr. Krabs?  I call it, ""Krabby Pâté."" Classy, huh? Serve it while it's hot, Patrick."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, were those jewels on the patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. You said, ""Fancy-up the food"", so I found some shiny stuff for garnish. Got a whole box."
"Mr. Krabs"," What the—  SpongeBob, you can't just go around taking people's precious jewels!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was just doing what you told me."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't worry about it. Just tell me where you got them gems from."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, upstairs. I went left, then right, then double and triple right, then down, up, and right 18 more times. Then do four somersaults, a barrel roll, jump backwards twice, spin till you get sick...  And you're there."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay. "
"Patrick"," Fancy foods! Get your fancy foods here!"
"Patrick"," I love delicious stuff. My turn!"
"Patrick"," Yummy."
"Patrick"," Mine! "
"Squidward"," Who wants food? I'm a mindless drone with food. Working for the man. Huh?"
"Squidward"," Ooh. "
"Squidward"," Here you go, princess."
"Squidward"," Let's do this thing."
"Squidward"," Hey, where are you going?"
"Squidward"," Oh, down here."
"Squidward"," I never heard of a marching quintet."
"Squidward"," Uh, wait for me. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait, wait—  Hey, hey! "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, what did he say? 18 rights, then four lefts, or five? Ooh."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, you—get off! Enough of this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Give me those! Young boy like yourself shouldn't be playing with fireworks. They're too dangerous."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, uh, quick, in here! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Um, yes, ma'am?"
"Patrick"," Mine, mine!"
"Patrick"," Mine, mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, I'll be right down to have a look. Just need to find something here. All right, where was I? Four somersaults and a barrel roll, I think."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! The food is for the guests!"
"Squidward"," What the—?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa.  This must be the place.  Hello? Ooh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh-ee. That is one big—water bed?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Dogfish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't call me that! And stop jumping on that water bed! You'll pop it!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Get over here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, you little—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Barrel roll, four somersaults!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look out, flood's a-coming!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice doing business with you!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no."
"Mr. Krabs"," My check!"
"SpongeBob"," Did somebody call my name?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Is there something wrong with your sandwich, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please, sir. Don't. Stop. You really can stop, sir."
"Mr. Krabs","  Everyone seems to really like the Krabby Patty!"
"Squidward","  Some people started calling it the ""SpongeBob Patty!"""
"Mr. Krabs"," What? That's ridiculous. It's always been the Krabby Patty. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Maybe you should change the name of this place from the Krusty Krab to ""SpongeBob's Place!"""
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, guys! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," Help!"
"Squidward","  Admit it. Without SpongeBob, you'd be nothing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's not true! I'm the one who made the SpongeBob Pat—I mean the Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob","  All right, Mr. Krabs. If you think the Krusty Krab is haunted and needs ghost-busting, I'll stay away for a while. "
"Squidward"," Haunted, eh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you believe in ghosts?"
"Squidward"," Oh, admit it! You're jealous of SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course not! But I'll be cooking the Krabby Patties from now on! Krabby Patties – named after me! Mr. Krabby.  Ouch!"
"SpongeBob","  What do we do now, Gary? We read every book and played every game! Hey, I know! How about another makeover?"
"SpongeBob"," You know, I can't go to the Krusty Krab. But I can play Krusty Krab!  Oh! This could be the register boat!  And you can be Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Squidward? 30 Krabby Patties? Coming right up! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, everybody, order up!  Guess I'm used to making Krabby Patties in mass quantities. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, you guys. Just make yourself comfortable. More patties on the way!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Whoa!"
"Squidward","  These are being sent back!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? What's wrong with them?"
"Squidward"," Customers said to make them good like they used to be."
"Mr. Krabs"," Like they used to be? It's the same formula!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Wait, wait! Please don't go! We're, we're having a two-for-one sale! For every two you buy, you can buy another one!  Oh! Hold on, everybody!  I think I hear SpongeBob's hideous laughter coming from the kitchen!  I'll show you that the customers are always wrong!"
"Squidward"," Oh boy... Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Now go ahead! Call attention to me!"
"Squidward","  Hey, everybody! Look who's back in the kitchen!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready! I'm ready!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Is everybody enjoying their Krabby Patties? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha-ha!  It was me who cooked those patties! You're all enjoying my food!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no, you don't!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Anyone who wants to leave has to go through me first!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahh! Ow! Eee! Hey! Oh! Whoa! Ah! Blazes!"
"Squidward"," G'night, boss! See you in the morning! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ow! Eee! Hey!"
"Squidward"," ""SpongeBob's Place?"" What in the ocean?  Pardon me. Don't mind me!  Just trying to get in my own front door! "
"Squidward"," Everybody's a comedian. This is Squidward Tentacles, and I'd like to lodge a complaint about my neighbor SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wasting your time, boys. You should just take me straight to the morgue. I'm done."
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop! Stop here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Make a hole!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs. Place your order with Gary, please. And drop your money anywhere. I'm running out of places to put it. I really don't have time to count it."
"SpongeBob","  Here, try one."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, it's delicious."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, I ran out of napkins. You'll have to use a $100 bill. "
"Mr. Krabs","  You deserve your own place. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, don't go! I need you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, what do you need me for? You got everything a magic touch for cooking, lots of customers, money!"
"SpongeBob"," I could use a boss. Someone to take all the credit and all the money."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? Hmmm. Well, I suppose I could do some bossing. How's a 99% for me and 1% for you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's more than generous!"
"Squidward","  No people are ever coming back here. Hey... no people. That's great! Because... I hate people!  ♪I hate people! People hate me! I prefer my own best company! Single and secluded on my own! I can have the best of times all alone because I hate people!♪"
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I do own 99% of SpongeBob's Place so I guess that's a yes. But you'll have to stand in line if you want to place an order!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's going on?"
"Mr. Krabs"," We've been shut down."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it was bun while it lasted! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, I know of an empty restaurant that's got all its papers in order. We can move in right away."
"SpongeBob"," Did you get rid of the ghost?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, the ghost is gone."
"Squidward"," ♪I hate people! I'm still that way! La, la, la, la, la, la, hey, hey, hey!♪"
"SpongeBob"," Sounds like it's still haunted."
"Squidward"," ♪I hate SpongeBob! I hate Krabs! I wish they would leave the ocean in taxi cabs! And all the customers can kiss my abs! 'Cause I'm the one and only—♪"
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward","  And...uh...oh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, I've been doing some thinking. You're a big part of this place, boy-o, and I believe I should share the name with you.  Take a gander."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. It looks the same."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, climb up there! Get a closer look."
"SpongeBob"," Where?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Under the words, ""Krusty Krab!"""
"SpongeBob","  ""The Krusty Krab...""  And SpongeBob's Place."" Oh, Mr. Krabs, you're the best!  Whoo!"
"Plankton"," What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there?! "
"Plankton","  Great."
"Plankton"," Ehh...  No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer?  Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!"
"Plankton"," I said not now–  oww-oww!"
"Plankton"," No one asked you!  Are you happy now, Karen?"
"Plankton"," Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!"
"Plankton"," Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!"
"Plankton"," I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me...  leave!!  Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said."
"Plankton"," I wasn't taking to you, idiot!  Pain!  Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!"
"Plankton"," Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!"
"Plankton"," So is it cool if I crash here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No!"
"Plankton"," Then can I just use your bathroom?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!"
"Plankton"," Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob"," Suit yourself."
"Plankton"," Okay, fine! "
"Plankton"," Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom."
"SpongeBob","  Silly, that's not my bathroom."
"Plankton"," Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?"
"Plankton","  Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!  We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair? "
"Plankton"," Oh, forget this!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out."
"Plankton"," Threw me out? I threw her in! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings.  Oh, somebody's tense!"
"Plankton"," Hey! What? Get off! Get—Oh!  Oh, that's the spot."
"SpongeBob"," Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight."
"Plankton"," I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!"
"Plankton"," But I'm the best."
"SpongeBob"," Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive."
"Plankton"," Me, aggressive?! How dare you?!  Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person!  I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, in a word yes!"
"Plankton"," What is that dimwit doing here?"
"Patrick"," Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!"
"Plankton"," Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit."
"Patrick"," Oh. Thanks!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this.  After you."
"Patrick","  I'm happy, SpongeBob!  Can someone get me out of here?  Whew!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Plankton. Now you try!"
"Plankton"," Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it.  Ugh. After you."
"Plankton"," Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Try this one."
"Plankton","  After you."
"Patrick"," But I can't fit through there."
"Plankton"," How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!"
"Patrick"," Ahh!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, no!"
"Patrick"," Can someone get me out of here?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice."
"Plankton"," Easy!"
"SpongeBob"," Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice."
"Plankton"," Uh...Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one."
"SpongeBob"," No, try again."
"Plankton"," Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant."
"Patrick"," Thanks! I like...um...your antennas."
"Plankton"," What? What's wrong with my antennas?!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you."
"Plankton"," Yeah, right! You two are mocking me! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I think we better try something else."
"Plankton"," It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!"
"Plankton"," Brother."
"Plankton","  Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart. "
"Plankton"," That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit! "
"SpongeBob"," That wasn't even close to what I said."
"Plankton"," Sure it was. And I know just how to do it. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I feel uncomfortable."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, are you sure about this?"
"Plankton"," Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I like that!  Boop beep! Beep boop boop!"
"Plankton"," Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot."
"SpongeBob"," Beep boop! "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you!  Ow!  I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!"
"Plankton","  This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, I don't want to eat this!"
"Plankton"," Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob, just EAT IT!"
"Plankton"," Ugh.  Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Plankton-poo, you say the sweetest things!"
"Plankton"," I never knew what love was until I met you!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!"
"SpongeBob"," You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies. "
"Plankton"," 1,000 WHAT??!!"
"SpongeBob"," YEAH!"
"Plankton"," NO!!! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, AND NOW YOU'RE RUINING IT!!!!"
"SpongeBob","  Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me."
"Plankton"," Of course I did.  I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that is so sweet!"
"Plankton"," Eww, it's that fat screensaver again."
"Plankton"," Now, Karen, take it easy!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna go now. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I am ripped. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, yes. Yes, I have."
"SpongeBob"," Life insurance?"
"SpongeBob"," I... Umm... "
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Okay, thanks! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! "
"SpongeBob","  It's my life insurance. I got one for you too!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy, life insurance!!  Life insurance, life insurance, life insurance, life insurance!  What's life insurance?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm not sure, but I think that means for the rest of our lives we are protected. We can't get hurt."
"Patrick","  This contract tastes legitimate, but I don't believe it! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's try to get hurt and we'll see."
"Patrick"," Huh. Well finally, something I'm good at!"
"SpongeBob"," Remarkable!  You can hit me all you want...  ... yet I can't be damaged! This life insurance is really working."
"Patrick"," I've become unbreakable!"
"Squidward"," Why I do raise seahorses!  Well, I don't know if I call myself international playboy! "
"Squidward"," Just what are you two ignorami doing out here?"
"SpongeBob"," We're trying to hurt each other."
"Patrick"," Ooh! "
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," You got a sea spider on your head."
"Squidward"," It's not a sea spider, you dope! It's... my hair!"
"Squidward"," Wait a second. Hurt each other? Oh, I'm gonna enjoy seeing this."
"Squidward"," Stop, stop, stop! I thought you said you were trying to hurt each other!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, we're trying."
"Squidward"," Well, you're not gonna do any damage with soft pillows!  Here, try this."
"Patrick"," Okay.  Squidward was wrong. Didn't hurt him, just made him disappear."
"Squidward"," Ah! Sea spider! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh-oh, no, Patrick, I'm slipping...and falling!  I didn't even break a bone!"
"Patrick"," My turn!  I'm losing my footing!  Oof! I've survived a deadly fall unhurt!"
"SpongeBob"," Life insurance!"
"Squidward","  Hi-ya! Hi-ya!"
"SpongeBob","  What? I can't hear you!"
"Squidward","  Hi-ya!"
"Patrick","  Turn the volume up inside of your voice!"
"Squidward"," I said... "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what were you yelling?"
"Squidward"," I was trying to say that you got to fall from something higher. "
"Patrick"," Sea spider! "
"Squidward"," Ah! My baby!"
"Squidward"," Once again, I'm asking, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," It's our final test. We're trying to get jellyfish to sting us to prove we can't get hurt."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Patrick"," Sting me, sting me, sting me!"
"SpongeBob"," Blast me with your venom!"
"Patrick"," Zap me with your pain juice!"
"Squidward"," They're the ones asking... "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Squidward,  maybe you should get some life insurance."
"Squidward"," What are you yammering about?"
"SpongeBob"," I bought some life insurance for Patrick and myself and now we can never be hurt."
"Patrick"," Yeah! To test out the life insurance, we even built a super dangerous obstacle course across the street! "
"SpongeBob"," We call it, ""The Sushi Maker.""  Squidward, I think you need this more than I. I would like to present you with my life insurance policy. "
"Patrick","  Actually, you better take two, since you kind of a klutz. "
"Squidward"," Better take two? Life insurance?  You giblet heads! No piece of paper can protect a person from getting hurt!"
"SpongeBob"," Yay! It works!"
"Patrick"," You're untouchable!"
"Squidward"," Oh, that was just a coincidence!"
"SpongeBob"," You are magically protected."
"Patrick"," Whoo-hoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo!"
"Squidward"," Oh, it was just luck! Dumb luck!"
"Squidward"," Look, I'll prove it. You stand here."
"Squidward"," Huh?  Hmm? Oh."
"Patrick"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," You see, Squidward? You're immune!"
"Patrick"," You can't be hurt!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! You are a cast-iron Squidward."
"Squidward"," Wow, I can't believe it, but you two sub-geniuses were right somehow. I can't be broken. I'm indestructible! I am shatterproof! Watch this. "
"SpongeBob"," What you gonna do, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," What does it look like? I'm running into a...  wall!"
"Squidward"," Did you see that? I ran right through a brick wall. I'm hard as nails! Come on, world! Bring it on! "
"Squidward"," Oh, perfect."
"Squidward"," Pfft. Big tough guy. "
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Just watch. Enjoying your sherbet, Herbert?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I know it's not. Your name is ""Hey."" What's your name?"
"Squidward"," Told ya! Here, let me help you."
"Squidward"," Funny, didn't feel a thing. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward, I don't think you should lick that. It's got germs."
"Squidward"," Ha! Germs can't hurt me. Nothing can hurt me!"
"Squidward"," As a matter of fact, do you know what I'm gonna do now? I'm gonna run your super dangerous obstacle course. You know why?"
"Patrick"," Mm-mmm."
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Squidward"," Because now I've got moxie!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What goes on, boyos?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward is gonna try out The Sushi Maker."
"Mr. Krabs"," Why does he want to do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. He's got life insurance. He can't be hurt."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not how life insurance works."
"Patrick"," It's not?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Course not!  Life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. By the way, who gets the money?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's see.  No name here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hooray!  Eugene H. Krabs. Go, Squidward!  Yay! Fly high! Do or die! Preferably the latter. "
"SpongeBob"," D-d-d-d-do or die?! Squidward, come down! You're not invincible! Life insurance is not what you think! You were right! Oh, it was just dumb luck!"
"Patrick"," Now I'm yelling too!"
"Squidward"," Oh, what are those ninnies going on about now? I can't hear you! Just shut up and watch me!  Nah—hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Come back, Squidward! Don't do this!"
"Squidward"," Will you stop shaking it?"
"Squidward"," No, no, no, no, no!"
"Squidward"," Ow..."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, guess what I learned today. Apparently, a life insurance policy doesn't protect a person from injury. Heh, how about that?"
"Squidward"," Ha, how 'bout that? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, how did you survive The Sushi Maker?"
"Squidward","  It had to be this."
"SpongeBob"," Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm trying!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! "
"SpongeBob"," So, uh, how'd I do?"
"SpongeBob","  But—but—"
"SpongeBob"," I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash!  Isn't it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?"
"Patrick"," Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now."
"SpongeBob"," Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later. "
"Patrick"," Catch! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh!  Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles.  Oh! That's it!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, all right."
"SpongeBob"," Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?"
"SpongeBob","  You don't need a license to drive a bubble."
"SpongeBob"," Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!"
"SpongeBob"," Then I made a right turn on red like this."
"SpongeBob"," You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves."
"SpongeBob"," One bubble boat coming right up!"
"Plankton"," Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I sure do, Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Oof!"
"Plankton"," Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! "
"Plankton"," Ouch!"
"Plankton"," Strike fear..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it, Larry!"
"SpongeBob","  I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P.  You'll be learning from a master."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this."
"SpongeBob"," Nice start."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, you're ready."
"SpongeBob"," Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. "
"SpongeBob"," Nice and easy. Doing great."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!"
"SpongeBob"," It's okay! Just calm down!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?"
"SpongeBob"," Doh!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪"
"Plankton"," Whoa, big fella!"
"Plankton","  Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out.  First I break into the safe, and...  Huh? Wait, is this live?"
"Plankton"," Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret!  I will destroy all of you! "
"Plankton"," Secret formula, ho! "
"Plankton","  I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly. "
"Plankton","  Ow!  The fool! He left the safe open! "
"Plankton"," Open for business, baby! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Gotcha! "
"Plankton"," Urrgh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm off to make a delivery. "
"Plankton"," Ha, that fool!"
"Plankton"," And the Krabby Patty is made of..."
"Plankton"," Urchins!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Gotcha! "
"Plankton"," Yoink!"
"Plankton","  Yes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pull!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yee-haw! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Gotcha! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Gotcha."
"Plankton"," Whee!  Come to daddy, patty!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Gotcha. "
"Plankton"," Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!"
"Plankton","  No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, did you see that? Plankton is retiring."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll believes it when I sees it."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey, ha ha!  All hands on deck, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, Mr.—Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, you want to say good-bye to Plankton, you old softy you."
"Mr. Krabs"," That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!"
"SpongeBob"," ""Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring..."""
"Mr. Krabs","  Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!"
"Plankton"," A new life in a new town! "
"SpongeBob"," I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring."
"Mr. Krabs"," Believes it when I sees it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Quick, boy, he's getting away!"
"Plankton"," I'd like a room, please."
"Plankton"," Forever. "
"Plankton"," And so begins my retirement! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick."
"Plankton","  Yes!  Yes! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!"
"Plankton"," Yes! My plan is almost complete! "
"Mr. Krabs"," His plan!  Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, ""plan!"""
"SpongeBob"," Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton"," Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on.  Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now that I sees it, I believes it."
"SpongeBob"," Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr.  Krabs! "
"Plankton"," Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh.  Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble."
"Plankton"," Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?"
"Plankton","  Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!"
"SpongeBob","  So what'd I miss?"
"Plankton","  That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula.  Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go."
"Plankton"," In your face, Krabs! Ha!"
"Plankton"," Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?"
"Mr. Krabs"," We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha! "
"Plankton","  Hate! Hate!  Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!"
"Plankton"," So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob.  Gimme that! "
"SpongeBob","  Hello? Krusty Krab, may I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back.  Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I was still reading that! "
"Squidward"," Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead!  Hey, who's responsible for this? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up! "
"SpongeBob"," Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all."
"Squidward"," 37 Krabby Patties! Fast! "
"SpongeBob"," 37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties?  Huh, has my spatula always had three heads? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get them patties out here fast SpongeBob!  Arrgh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, my spatula never did that before."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!"
"Mr. Krabs","  We're running out of these dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! Faster!"
"SpongeBob","  Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs!  I'm trying!  Come on, you, work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! This is gonna cost me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Right you are, boy-o!  Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop!  There you go! What's happening to me?!"
"SpongeBob"," What is going on around here?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what's this?  Whoa! My spatula is magic!"
"SpongeBob"," This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone."
"SpongeBob","  I'll help you, baby! Boing!"
"SpongeBob"," There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea!  Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today."
"SpongeBob"," Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea. "
"Patrick"," Oh.  No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain? "
"SpongeBob"," Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!"
"Patrick"," Ahhh! Best day ever! "
"SpongeBob"," I can fix this!"
"Patrick"," Boo!"
"SpongeBob"," I think I know a way to make you both happy."
"Patrick"," An ice cream geyser!"
"Patrick"," Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself."
"Patrick"," Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait.  Okay, now save us!"
"SpongeBob"," Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything."
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that."
"Mr. Krabs"," Take me money!"
"Patrick","  Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything."
"SpongeBob"," No sponge should have this much power."
"SpongeBob"," Not helping!"
"SpongeBob"," My spatula! T-Then what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh! Make it stop!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Give me back me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know."
"SpongeBob"," Let's get 'em!"
"Squidward","  An urchin!"
"Squidward"," Hey, lady, take your infested-patty with you! Okay, no need to panic, Squidward. It's just a puny urchin. Everything's gonna be fine as long as you... Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!  Whew!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone.  He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is.  This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot.  Would you like to see a menu, Monsieur?  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, little guy, see you later.  Good thing he is a little guy. Ouch."
"SpongeBob"," What the shrimp?  Hey, what's going on here?  Whoa! That's too hot!  Whooaaa!  Wow.  Oops. "
"SpongeBob"," I steamed myself tiny. Whoo-hoo! I steamed myself tiny! Whoo!  This place is huge!  My spatula's huge! And just look at the size of my grill. It's huge!  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob","  Come on, flip! Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh. The grill blew out. Well,  it isn't gonna fix itself.  That's one small step for SpongeBob, one giant leap for—  Whee!!  Whoa!  Bob.  Whew!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," What is that?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's my little urchin friend. Aww, hey, little guy, don't cry. Your old pal, WheeBob, will get ya outta there."
"SpongeBob"," Little urchin, you are free to go! You okay?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeouch!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry little guy!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Follow the pipes to freedom, little guy! I'll never forget you.  Really.  Ow! What is all that noise?"
"Squidward","  One Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Comin' right up!"
"Squidward"," Urchin?!  Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah-ha!  You're gettin' sloppy, Plankton. Squidward almost squashed ya.  Back to the bucket with ya!"
"SpongeBob"," No! No, Mr. Krabs! It's meeee!  Whoa-ho! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh!  That tickles."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Karen. Where's Plankton?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Plankton! "
"Plankton"," SpongeBoob? Why are you so small? Is this a trick?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't mean to get small like you, Plankton. It was a freak accident."
"Plankton"," Huh? Who are you callin' a freak?! Wait a second.  Hold this.  You're not small like me, Shorty! I am a towering half-a-millimeter taller than you!  I win! "
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!  I'll get that."
"Plankton"," Don't touch that! "
"SpongeBob"," Oops."
"Plankton","  Get him outta here, Karen!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!!"
"SpongeBob","  Bleach!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa! You can't catch me! "
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob in the corner pocket! Doink!"
"Squidward"," You brats get back in the play area or I'll eighty-six your face!"
"Squidward"," Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Krusty Krab action figures aren't free ya know! So, get your parents' money and you can have it."
"Squidward"," Uh, Eugene, we don't sell action figures."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hmm..."
"SpongeBob"," Peekaboo!"
"Squidward"," What the—"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what are you doing in my hand? And why aren't you back there flippin' patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. K. I shrunk myself by mistake. But I won't let it affect my job. I will get back to flippin' right now. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on there, Tiny. I can't have you workin' the grill no more. Too dangerous for a little guy like you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, please, Mr. Krabs! There must be some job I could do! I don't care what it is! Please, please, please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, I'll think of somethin'. But since you're so small now, I can only pay ya a penny. A year."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!  That's big money!  Whoa!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. Now what could I do with a little SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Roll up your sleeves, boy-o! You're a personal hygienist now!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo! Yay!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Break time, SpongeBob! Take five, but hurry back! You gotta start earnin' that penny!"
"Squidward","  Hmph. Work the register, clean the windows, make the patties. I have to do everything now. Thanks a lot, ShrinkBob.  Ow! Ow! "
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Squidward! I'll make the patties for you—oh. Yeah. I forgot. I'm too little.  Boy, I'm really gonna miss my old job."
"Mr. Krabs"," Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward! Now, wash those dishers!"
"Squidward","  ""Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward. Now, wash some dishes."""
"SpongeBob"," The bubbles are making me bigger! More bubbles!"
"Squidward"," What the—"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Squidward! I'm big enough to flip patties again!  Oh-ho-ho!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa!"
"Squidward"," Ahh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, call the fire department!"
"SpongeBob"," No need to call 'em, Mr. Krabs.  We'll be there in five minutes depending on traffic. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Make a left at the light!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew!"
"SpongeBob"," What's that?"
"Patrick","  Looks like a box."
"SpongeBob"," Wonder who it belongs to.  Maybe it says on the other side."
"Patrick"," Oh, look, it's open."
"SpongeBob"," It is?"
"Patrick","  Yup."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh.  It's—it's—  It's stuff! "
"Patrick","  Oh, I knew it! But what does this stuff do?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, this must be for getting books off the top shelf. "
"Patrick"," Hey! "
"Patrick"," Wow."
"Patrick"," This must be a whipped cream holder."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Patrick, are you okay?"
"Patrick"," Yum."
"SpongeBob"," This must be a portable snail bed.  ♪Rock-a-bye Gary♪"
"Patrick"," I wanna try!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww. "
"Squidward","  Oh, it may have taken you all morning, Squidward, but this is a meal fit for a king.  Oh. My croque-madame is ready. "
"Squidward","  What the—"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! Patrick! What do you two think you're— wow."
"Squidward"," My begonias! What are you lunk heads doing with all this equipment?"
"Squidward"," You don't know what this stuff is?!"
"Squidward"," This is a soccer ball... that is a tennis racket,  and these are a couple of morons!  Now, be quiet! And clean up all of your sports junk!"
"Squidward","  Sports are games you play for points. The points determine the winner of the game."
"Patrick"," Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I love games!"
"SpongeBob"," Me too! You must know a lot about ""sportz,"" Squidward. Will you teach us how to play?"
"Squidward"," I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than—"
"Squidward"," You know, on second thought, I'd be happy to teach you all about sports, SpongeBob. "
"Squidward"," All right, the object of this game is to throw the horseshoe around the stick."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, seems easy enough."
"Squidward"," Sure, but you have to do it...  blindfolded. "
"Patrick"," Um, do we throw now?"
"Squidward"," Yes."
"SpongeBob"," At the same time?"
"Squidward"," Yes! Throw it at the same time! Throw!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," Ow!  Aw, we didn't hit the sticks. Did we do bad?"
"Patrick","  My face hurts."
"Squidward"," Oh, no, no, no. You both did good. Pain is—uh, worth points. You know the phrase, ""no pain, no gain."""
"Patrick","  I want pain points! "
"Squidward"," Yeah, that's great. Now do it—oh, 100 more times. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"Squidward"," Oh, Squiddy, you're a genius."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, can the game be over now? All this pain is starting to hurt."
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry. There's no way to end the game without one of you winning."
"Squidward"," Ready...set...go! "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, are you sure we're doing this right? These running shoes are really hurting my ankles."
"Squidward"," Oh, you're absolutely doing it right. Try to pick up the pace, though."
"Patrick"," Comin' through!"
"Squidward"," And...time. Let's see those ankles."
"Squidward","  Oh, yeah, those look bad. You both get—mm, 50 points. Why not?"
"Patrick"," Hey, then we're still tied!"
"Sandy"," Hmm. Hmm. Where is it? Where is it? Hmm. Ah-ha! There's my box of sports gear. It must've fallen off the mail truck. But what happened to all the equipment?"
"Sandy"," What was that?"
"Sandy"," Huh? SpongeBob, what's going on?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey— Sandy. Patrick and I are— in the middle of a sports game."
"Sandy"," This sure don't look like any sport I've seen before."
"SpongeBob"," I believe it's called kickboxing, or something?"
"Sandy"," Well, whatever it is, it seems to be causing you lots of pain."
"Patrick"," Ow! Sure is.  Ooh!"
"Sandy"," Why not stop playing it if it hurts so bad?"
"Patrick"," We can't stop... Until we break our tie."
"Sandy"," Says who?"
"Sandy"," I ain't never heard of a rule giver."
"Squidward","  I prefer ""King of Sports,"" but you can never tell what will catch on with the small folk."
"Sandy"," You're making up a game where SpongeBob and Patrick hurt themselves, and you won't let them stop?!"
"Squidward"," I'm just giving the people what they want."
"Sandy"," That's pretty low, Squidward, even for you. I'm putting a stop to this. SpongeBob and Patrick have had enough!"
"Squidward"," See? They're fine. Let the games resume."
"Sandy"," Oh, I don't think so. Y'all want to see a game? Fine. Squidward, I challenge you to a game—a game of basketball. Winner decides the fate of SpongeBob and Patrick."
"Squidward"," Huh?  Me? Play sports? No, no. I'm mostly in an advisory position."
"Sandy"," See you on the court, Your Highness. "
"Sandy"," Hey, Squidward, one more thing. We're playing San Antonio rules."
"Squidward"," San ""A—what—io"" rules?"
"Sandy"," Check!"
"Squidward"," Oh, that was a foul!"
"Sandy"," Tell it to your mama, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Mama?"
"Sandy"," Next round's soccer."
"Squidward"," What the what?"
"Sandy"," Sure. Every time you score, you pick a new sport. I thought you knew all the rules, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Well, uh, yeah, well, of course I do. Yeah."
"Sandy"," Good, then block this!"
"Squidward","  Block what?"
"Squidward"," Oh, come on, I wasn't even ready!"
"Sandy"," No time outs! Football round!"
"Squidward","  Just give me a second to—"
"Sandy"," Good game, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Ow, ow, ow."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Sandy! That was amazing!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I liked the part where you did that thing with the ball and stuff."
"Sandy","  Thanks, boys. Looks like we're all done here. That goes for you too. I'm ending your game."
"Patrick","  But we're still tied."
"Sandy"," Don't worry, I'm declaring you both winners."
"Sandy"," Aww, don't worry, Squidward.  You're a winner too."
"Squidward"," I hate winning.  Ow."
"SpongeBob"," You must be the new driving instructor."
"SpongeBob"," Student driver. That's me. I just don't take a bad picture, do I?"
"SpongeBob"," Great! Look how I can tune the radio. "
"SpongeBob"," I thought it'd made me look cool.  Guess not."
"SpongeBob"," Ohhhhh, that I can do!"
"SpongeBob","  Good baby?"
"SpongeBob","  I say, how's my automobiling?"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me sir, I'm in the middle of a driving lesson!"
"SpongeBob"," You got it! Turning around!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're a great instructor! What now?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't understand how this is gonna help with my driving."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I've heard of that!"
"SpongeBob"," Distract with the abstract. "
"SpongeBob"," What's the next lesson?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy."
"SpongeBob","  Ah! Wha— Oop.  Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," I know just the place! But first, let me adjust your seat."
"SpongeBob","  Oh! Ooh, driving range!"
"SpongeBob"," How's my driving?"
"SpongeBob","  Doh! That kinda hurts, don't ya think?"
"SpongeBob","  Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh!  Oh, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Would you like to test me on road signs now? Let's see...  ""Stop,"" ""No Left Turn,"" and that one over there that says ""Falling Rocks!"""
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mrs. Puff! The new instructor's been teaching me so much. Not as much as you. But y'know, different things."
"SpongeBob"," He hasn't taught me that one yet!  Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, professor!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where'd the new instructor go? Oh, well, I still have ten minutes left on my driving lesson.  Oh, Mrs. Puff?"
"Squidward"," Hmm."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Where are those patties?"
"SpongeBob"," Coming right...down, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," What are you talking about, SpongeBob? Don't you mean coming right up?"
"SpongeBob"," Mmm..."
"Squidward"," I don't see what you're— "
"SpongeBob"," Nice catch, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Thanks..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha, ha, all right, don't worry, little boy, we'll find it!  This kid lost his toy. SpongeBob, I need you to check the Lost and Found."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found."
"Mr. Krabs"," You better find it quick, SpongeBob. The kid's bawlin' is chasing me customers away. Follow me, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Is there a ladder?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's the ladder, boy-o! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I— "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice catch!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, nothing, nothing. Good luck!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this must be the Lost and Found!  It's not in here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Try turning on the lights!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost ""cool guy"" shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side? "
"SpongeBob"," What a funny echo. Ha...ha."
"SpongeBob","  Hey!  There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws!  I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow!  I love lost novelty items!  Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me! Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps!  What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob"," Whew!  Whoa!"
"Squidward"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, you know that crying kids?"
"Squidward"," He's still crying...and it's still annoying!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, I'm glad you're here. I think SpongeBob may be lost in the Lost and Found."
"Squidward"," And this concerns me how, exactly?  Wait—what?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry. There's a ladder."
"Mr. Krabs"," And find that toy...pronto!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?"
"SpongeBob"," Did you drop a box on my head?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh!  Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too."
"SpongeBob"," How did you survive down here all this time?"
"SpongeBob"," Your breath is delightfully fresh."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!"
"SpongeBob","  Yoink! Losers weepers! "
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!"
"Squidward"," Moron! I mean, SpongeBoooob?! I can't believe Old Man Krabs has held on to all this stuff.  Oooh! Kazoos! Why, I had a kazoo when I was a child..."
"Squidward"," Everybody loved it!"
"Squidward"," These are clarinets!! In fact, these are all my clarinets! Wait a minute—these weren't lost! They were all in my locker! Mmm..  Now what could that possibly—"
"Squidward","  Typical."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward? SpongeBob? It's the curse of the Lost and Found no one ever gets found. They just stay lost.  Oh, well, back to work."
"Mr. Krabs","  Stinky ambiance? Oooh, it's a dark time for the Krusty Krab."
"Mr. Krabs"," Waaaaah!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Lost toys! "
"SpongeBob"," Lost Toilets? "
"SpongeBob"," Lost Pets! "
"SpongeBob"," Lost Mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Lost world!"
"Squidward"," A hatch! Maybe that's the emergency exit!  Grease trap!?"
"SpongeBob"," Lost dead ends?! "
"SpongeBob"," No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child!  Huh?  Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I have a better idea! "
"Mr. Krabs"," No SpongeBob, no teddy fish, no customers!  All is lost!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Who is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Tylo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Tylo who? "
"SpongeBob"," Tylosaurus!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ack!  Get back! Get back!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm. Maybe I should put up a sign."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, all the old people are hugging."
"SpongeBob"," Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I guess we all learned a lesson about being lost and being found today."
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!"
"Patrick"," Back! Back!"
"Patrick"," Whoa!"
"Patrick"," Oh, boy! Here it is! My lost coupon! I found it!"
"Patrick"," You have fought well today, sea spider, and now I must leave. For I am going to use this coupon to get an ice cream for my bestest friend in the whole ocean—um..  Sponge Knob Hair Pants!  Hmm.  Hmm!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick","  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," What you doin'?"
"Patrick"," I got this here free coupon and I'm gonna get you an ice cream."
"SpongeBob"," That's nice of you, buddy, but I already got an ice cream."
"Patrick"," Uh...but I'm getting you an ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," Why would ya? I already got one."
"Patrick","  Because I'm a nice guy! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow. There goes the nicest guy."
"Patrick"," Whoa."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hooray! I win a free coupon!"
"Patrick"," H-how did you know about my free coupon?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me back knows.  It breaks out in hives around anything free."
"Patrick","  Guh."
"Mr. Krabs"," I also know how heavy a free coupon can be."
"Patrick"," It's heavy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Much too much responsibility for a carefree fellow like you. Tell you what. I'll take that free coupon off your hands for the price of a hearty handshake. "
"Patrick"," Uh...Oh. Ohh! Oh! SpongeBob does love handshakes."
"Squidward"," You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aww, come on. Can't an old crab have a little unscrupulous fun anymore? "
"Patrick"," Hey, you ruined my deal! I almost had a handshake!"
"Squidward","  Oh, you dingdong wing nut! Krabs was just trying to steal your coupon! "
"Patrick"," Steal my coupon? Hmm.  You want my ice cream coupon! You can't have it!"
"Patrick"," You."
"Patrick"," Oh, I see you...peeking at my coupon! It's for SpongeBob's ice cream!"
"Patrick"," Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!"
"Patrick"," No! You can't have my coupon! No! No!"
"Patrick"," Whaa!"
"Patrick"," Ooh.  Ah! Come back!  Ah!  I made it.  It's beautiful."
"Patrick"," Yes, it's a good day for ice cream!"
"Patrick"," Oh, I want your bestest ice cream for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob won't mind if I just take a little taste."
"Patrick"," No ice cream for SpongeBob? Uh!"
"Patrick"," I demand that you honor my coupon! "
"Patrick"," Take my coupon! Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Ah, take my—"
"Patrick"," I'm miserable."
"Patrick"," The Ice Cream King?"
"Patrick"," Wow."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Would you, please?"
"Patrick"," Hello?"
"Patrick"," Oh.  No. I'm not the extra gator. I'm here to redeem my coupon for a free ice cream! It's for my bestest friend, but it's out of date."
"Patrick"," I don't know what anything is."
"Patrick","  Apples?"
"Patrick","  It's down here today."
"Patrick"," Hey, you're right! "
"Patrick"," I didn't bring my reading eyes."
"Patrick"," Oh, ooh. It says ""garbaldy goop."""
"Patrick"," Wow. Oh... "
"Patrick"," Oh, man. "
"Patrick"," Not so fast!  Ha! Can I redeem my coupon now?"
"Patrick"," Ha, ha, ha! You'll wish your cone was a cup when I whip you into cream! Hi-ya! "
"Patrick"," They told me you had scoops, but your serve is soft. I see you've studied the ancient art of failure!  Redeem my coupon!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?"
"Patrick"," I was gonna give you this ice cream,  but it melted. Instead, I got you this hearty handshake. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!"
"SpongeBob","  Care to join me?"
"Squidward"," Ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings!"
"Squidward"," Hey, look at my arts you dummy!!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now! "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings."
"Squidward"," Buy some important paintings. See me expose my exquisite suffering."
"Squidward"," Hmph! These fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. I'll confront them with the power of my art!"
"Squidward"," Witness the beauty!"
"Squidward"," Come on, Larry! Get your art on! "
"Squidward","  How about some art to go with that? "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure he will!  I just bought one."
"Mr. Krabs","  Holy shrimp! Why would you do that to yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean? I love it."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!"
"SpongeBob"," But think about how valuable these paintings might become."
"Mr. Krabs"," Valuable? What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob"," When art gets older,  it usually gets more expensive.  Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday."
"Mr. Krabs"," Millions?!  Out of me way! Here!  Gimme!  Give it here! This is mine now!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Eugene H. Krabs does not— I'll lose money! There must be something I can do to make this art worth lots more cash!"
"Squidward"," I sold all my art? This tiny handful of coins has legitimized me!  Who wants the autograph of a real artiste?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this."
"Squidward"," Artist walking. Check me out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Check this out.  I have a delivery for ya, Mr. Squidward."
"Squidward"," What? You can't be serious. An artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, Mr. Squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything."
"Squidward"," The arctic is so cold!  Come on, Squidward. You're a strong artist. You can do it!  No!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Just getting some ice.  Fresh.  Need some help?  Whoa!"
"Squidward"," Here's your food."
"SpongeBob"," Eeh, we'd better get you home."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hello, is this the art appraiser? Just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, Squidward, is now ""out of the pict—""  Wh—wh—wh—What the seahorse?!  Got another delivery for you, Squidward!  And only Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Your eyes are so pretty."
"Squidward","  ""237 Rock Bottom."" Oh, there it is! Oh, remember, Squidward, real artists embrace the unknown.  Uh, is anyone here?  I've got a delivery from the Krusty  Krab!"
"Squidward"," Ahh!"
"SpongeBob","  What are we screaming about?"
"Squidward"," Monsters!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends."
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes, I'm sure that Mr. Squidward is out of the picture for good. He will be missed. So, come on over and tell old Krabs how much money me paintings are worth. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha.  Squidward, delivery! "
"SpongeBob"," Ha, this tickles. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Follow me, Mr. Squidward. I've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself."
"Squidward"," Well, that's more like it. Finally, some respect."
"Mr. Krabs"," Into the rocket ya go!"
"Squidward"," Wait! Why do I need a rocket? Where is this delivery to?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mars. "
"Squidward"," Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!"
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Delivery from the Krusty Krab."
"Squidward"," Hmph. All this red. So garish. Ha, this dump needs a true artist touch."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, now that Squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?  Oh, it's so complicated. These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, Squidward. Wherever he is."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay here and keep an eye on me investments. "
"Squidward","  Well, that was disgusting. So, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I have done everything I could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Run, Squidward, run!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! How about a little support here?"
"SpongeBob"," Run, Mr. Krabs, run!"
"SpongeBob"," But a little slower than Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Oh, get off of me!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe."
"Squidward"," I'll never be safe!  Not until my paintings are gone!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!"
"Squidward"," True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!"
"Squidward"," I...I can't do it! They're just too magnificent!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hey, hey! Get away from me paintings!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me!"
"Squidward"," What? Really?"
"Squidward"," Yes, feel my art! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Leave me paintings alone, you monster!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that."
"Squidward"," Oh, don't be so provincial, SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, stop trying to censor our money! I mean our art!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoo, boy! Hee, hee! So, how much ya gonna give me for all this? Ha, ha."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Wait, come back here, you double-crossin'—"
"SpongeBob"," D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!"
"Squidward"," I'm an artist."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm rich."
"SpongeBob"," And I helped. "
"Sandy"," Y'all are the best aquatic critter friends a lone star from out of town could ever have."
"Patrick"," Cake time! "
"Sandy"," Wah!"
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry. I always carry a spare."
"Sandy"," Oh, no you don't!  Hoo-hah! Karate slice! Hi-yah! "
"SpongeBob"," Enjoy the cake, everybody. I made it special just for Sandy.  Mm."
"Squidward"," I'm allergic to nuts. Are there any nuts in that?"
"SpongeBob"," Nope, no nuts."
"Squidward"," Oh, okay. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, unless you count ""wall nuts."""
"Squidward"," What? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm pretty sure walnuts are a fruit though, huh?"
"Sandy","  Whoa!  Tex Ritter! You don't see that everyday.  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Since when is the moon so green?"
"Patrick","  Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, SpongeBob.  It's just been up there so long, it's getting moldy.  Oh, but I'd still eat it. "
"Sandy"," That ain't the moon, guys. The real moon comes out at night, remember? Something's fishy going on here."
"Sandy"," You don't see that everyday. Did you see that, SpongeBob? Sponge...Bob?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob? Patrick?  Everyone listen to me! Get away from the light! The light is bad! Run for the shade!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm always a sucker for a good smooch."
"Sandy"," No! Not me!  Huh? I guess it only effects sea creatures, but I still don't get why that green moon is turning everyone into wild swimming fish?  Am I the only one left?"
"Squidward"," Oh, whoever used that restroom last was an animal!  Hey, put me down! Sandy! What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!  What is the meaning of—"
"Sandy"," Get in the shade! "
"Squidward"," I demand an explanation!"
"Sandy"," I'm getting one right now, Squidward! "
"Sandy"," Hey, Frenchy! It's me, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Oh, it's not hanging too good, Frenchy. You see, there's this—"
"Sandy"," Two hours?"
"Sandy"," I knewed it was nature, dagnabit! That's a relief. So I just have to keep Squidward in the shade for a couple of hours.  Whew! Thanks, Frenchy."
"Squidward","  I'm going home to hide under the covers! It's every cephalopod for himself! "
"Sandy","  Frenchy, I gotta call you back!  Squidward, you have to stay in the shade!"
"Squidward","  Help!"
"Sandy"," Squidward! No!"
"Sandy"," O.M. Jehoshaphat! You don't see that everyday.  My friends are gonna be lunch if I don't think fast!  SpongeBob! Patrick!  Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs!  Larry!  Yeeouch!  Look out, Pearl! I'll save you! Yee-ha!  Like busting a bronco! Yee-ha!  Whoa—oh—oh—oh!  Not the blowhole!  Hey! Everybody! The light is bad! Stay away from the light!"
"Sandy"," Hold your breath, creatures!"
"Sandy","  Here's where we get off!  Thanks for the lift, Pearl! Don't you worry. Nobody's going to eat you guys on my watch.  Ow!  Dinner time! Come and get it!  This is so fascinating, Frenchy. Tell me more about my fishy friends. Oh, wait. I'll put you on speaker phone. "
"Sandy"," Now that's what I call recycling, huh, Frenchy?"
"Sandy"," Oh, no, you don't."
"Sandy"," I knew I was gonna have to separate you two.  You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.  Ow!  Yeowch! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob is never gonna believe this."
"Sandy"," Texas toast! It's a good thing my treedome is made of ten tons of pressure proof glass, huh, Frenchy?"
"Sandy"," You don't see that everyday! Squidward, no!"
"Sandy"," Whoa!  Oh!  Hi-yah!  Aah, hominy grits! "
"Sandy"," My friends! My tree!"
"Sandy"," That's a great idea. "
"Sandy"," There she blows, y'all!"
"Sandy"," Sick 'em, Pearl! Sorry, Squidward!"
"Sandy"," Ooh! Ohh!"
"Sandy"," Oh! Two hours is up? Thank goodness."
"Squidward"," What is going on here?  My clothes! "
"Sandy"," Aah!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, Sandy, how come your treedome is broken and everyone's naked?"
"Sandy"," Well, SpongeBob, let's just say this has been the most interesting birthday I ever had."
"Sandy","  Yee haw! Whoo!"
"SpongeBob","  Oops.  Doink.  I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh?  Huh, I don't remember making such a mess.  And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti.  Nope.  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Patrick.  Wake up, Patrick!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! "
"SpongeBob"," No! "
"SpongeBob","  Whew. "
"SpongeBob"," Shh! Shhh!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. Phew."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh!  Ow! "
"SpongeBob","  Bleach!  Ow!"
"Patrick"," Mm. Ahh..."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, no!  Don't!"
"SpongeBob","  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"Patrick"," Breezy."
"Patrick"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, brother. "
"Patrick"," Oh!"
"Patrick"," Oh, he'll be fine."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?"
"Patrick"," It's cutting into my early morning nature nap. "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!"
"Patrick"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Cool ice cave!"
"Patrick"," Ohhhhhhh...  This whole place is a frozen treat! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!"
"Patrick"," Uh. Now he tells me. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic."
"Patrick"," I panicked, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything."
"Patrick","  Hot! Hot! Hot!  Hot! Agh! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today."
"SpongeBob"," See ya later, Patrick.  Gary, I'm home!  Boy, this backpack got heavy."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue."
"SpongeBob"," I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight!"
"Squidward"," It was.  Agh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?! You called me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?"
"SpongeBob","  Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course you wouldn't! It's just this loser's word against yours, boy-o. They can't convict you for that."
"SpongeBob"," Phew."
"SpongeBob"," But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, boy-o! I'm right behind you!  Look alive, Mr. Squidward!  I'm gonna visit SpongeBob in the big house. You are manning the grill! "
"Squidward","  Ow! "
"Squidward"," They let you out already? Ugh, you look terrible, SpongeBob!  Well, get the food ready. It's almost time for lunch! "
"Squidward"," Well, it's about time! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what did you do? The patties taste horrible! Everybody hates them!"
"Squidward"," What the—  SpongeBob's gone crazy! Run for your lives!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why did you have to go nuts on company time, boy-o? I'm gonna lose so much money."
"SpongeBob"," I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Save it for the judge, boy-o. Come clean! Nobody else even looks like you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Except that guy."
"SpongeBob"," See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to."
"Mr. Krabs"," We did?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh?  SpongeBob. SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you like that, huh?  Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow!"
"Patrick","  What are you doing, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm just checking out the beautiful clams. Did you know it's migration season?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I know.  I don't know! I lied to you! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's okay!"
"Patrick","  Okay."
"SpongeBob"," Do you need to blow your nose?"
"Patrick"," You're a good friend.  So can I see the clams?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! Here, use these. "
"Patrick"," Thanks!"
"Patrick"," Hey!  The binoculars are attacking! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we better just use our eyes."
"Patrick"," Good idea."
"Patrick"," Ooh! Clams are so pretty!"
"SpongeBob"," Just look at all those majestic species! There's the Soft Shell Clam."
"SpongeBob"," The Hard Shell Clam."
"SpongeBob"," The Giant Clam."
"SpongeBob"," Even a Razor Clam."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, I wish the clams were closer to us so we can get a better look."
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I know! They're always hungry when they migrate!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the patties are for the clams!"
"Patrick"," I'm sorry, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What? I'm not perfect.  But I am full. Nap time! "
"SpongeBob"," Aw. "
"SpongeBob"," It's working!  Huh?  Isn't that beautiful?"
"Squidward"," What is in a Squidward? A Squidward by any other name would—  Uh. Where was I? Ah, yes! A Squidward, dancing fast, moving like grace it—  Oh, that is it! Will you clams clam up?!  Oh, look at what the clams are doing to my beautiful home! SpongeBob, will you stop feeding those clams?"
"SpongeBob"," Why, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Because they're making a me—  Agh! Stop!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe I have been feeding these clams too much."
"Squidward","  I'll never be clean again!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Walking to work ain't too shabby! 'Cause I'll be whipping up a Krabby Patty!♪  Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Go on home, you clams! I have to go to work now. Go on. Go home. I don't have any more Krabby Patties for you. You need to find your own food.  Okay then. I'll just—  Oh! Follow the leader!"
"SpongeBob","  Bye! I'll see you crazy clams later."
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing? You know it's not nice to steal other people's food!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, don't worry. I see that we understand each other completely now."
"SpongeBob"," No! Bad clam! Sorry, sir!"
"SpongeBob"," What am I going to do? I can't leave the clams alone. They'll just have to go to work with me. Come on, you clams!"
"Squidward","  No! Not again! I just got clean!"
"SpongeBob"," Remember, no stealing food."
"SpongeBob"," Perch here and be good clams while I work."
"Mr. Krabs"," What the barnacle is going on here? How did all these clams get inside?"
"SpongeBob"," I couldn't leave them outside. They were stealing people's Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what do you think they're doing in here?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, stealing people's Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And costing me money!  Now get them out of here, boy!  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Bad clam! Don't spit pearls at nice Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearls?  Ooh! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll get all these clams out of here right now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not so fast, SpongeBob.  What's your hurry? "
"SpongeBob"," Didn't you just tell me to get the clams out of here 'cause they're stealing food from your customers?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ow! Forget the customers. If these clams keep spitting pearls at me, I'll be rich! Good clams. Good clams! Tee-hee-hee. Oh.  Bad clams! Stupid clams! Smelly clams!  Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow! "
"SpongeBob"," I've gotta get these clams out of here!  Follow me, clams."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! SpongeBob! Come back with those crummy clams!  Whoa! "
"SpongeBob"," I figured if I tired them out, maybe they'll behave better."
"SpongeBob"," Let's go, clams. Good boys!"
"SpongeBob","  There you are! No dawdling, now, come on."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, there you are."
"SpongeBob"," No, no pushing! We share the swing. Like this. Just watch.  Whee!  Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! "
"Squidward"," There you are!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Don't, ""Oh, hey, Squidward"" me! Not after you lured these monsters into town!  They are a menace to society and we want them out!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry the clams messed things up, but you must remember, they're wild animals."
"Squidward"," Exactly! And wild animals don't belong in a civilized town!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, maybe you're right. If you really want the clams gone, then I'll lead them out of town."
"Mr. Krabs"," In that case, let me just say this from the heart. Give me more pearls, you stupid, smelly clams!  I'm good."
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, I guess this is good-bye."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, the life of a clam is the best!  Brr! Getting cold out. Must be fall. I hate to say it, little clams, but it's time for you all to fly home to warmer climates.  Don't be sad. We'll see each other next year. I promise. Now go on.  The circle of life. Whelp, guess I should migrate home, too."
"Squidward"," Well, it took me a whole season, but it's finally clean.  The clams! They're back! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wait, Squidward. It's just me!"
"Squidward","  Drool pool! "
"Patrick","  What'd I miss? "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, have fun, you two. "
"SpongeBob"," It sure is nice to be home. "
"Plankton"," Spot? Spot?  Spot? Where are you, Spot?  Oh, there you are, boy! Come to me. Jump in my arms and give me your precious kisses."
"Plankton"," Good amoeba. You get a num-num."
"Plankton"," Karen! Not in front of the amoeba. Spot is fit as a fiddle."
"Plankton"," Come on, I'll prove it."
"Plankton"," Now you'll see how healthy my little Spotty-wotty is."
"Plankton"," Wha—pregnant? Ah, that can't be right. I thought he was a boy."
"Plankton"," We're not ready to have puppies, Karen! This is all happening a little too fast.  We have to set up a state-of-the-art delivery room, sanitize everything, baby-proof the Chum Bucket—wait. Where's Spot?"
"Plankton"," What the..."
"Plankton"," Puppies?"
"Plankton"," You did it, boy! Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.  Wait. Is that my good dinner jacket? "
"Plankton"," Yeesh. Calm down, Karen. You don't want to blow out your motherboard."
"Plankton"," Oh, sure, you take a couple of hours to reboot, Karen. It's fine. I'll just manage all these puppies all on my own!"
"Plankton"," Hey! Get down from there! Stop that! My furniture!"
"Plankton"," My experiments! Bad amoebas! Bad!  I don't get it, Karen. Spot is so well behaved, but the puppies don't listen to me at all. I think we need to get rid of them."
"Plankton"," Yeah, I know what you would say.  ""Don't you vaporize those puppies, Plankton."""
"Plankton"," Fine! If you insist, I'll find a non-vaporizing way to get rid of them. Jeez!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la—♪  Huh?  ""Free amoeba puppies?"" Oh, hey, Plankton. What's with the sign?"
"Plankton"," I fed Spot too much, and he had puppies. You want a few thousand?  They're free with an order of chum."
"SpongeBob","  No thank you, Plankton. I, uh, already ate. But I can help you get your puppies adopted. I did get Patrick into a good home."
"Mr. Krabs"," You sure this is a guard dog, SpongeBob?"
"Plankton","  This is our corner now!"
"SpongeBob"," Now, Plankton, just politely offer people free puppies, and they'll all be adopted in no time."
"Plankton","  You there! I demand you take an amoeba puppy!"
"Plankton"," These are purebred amoebas, swine!  Take this puppy or I'll destroy you!"
"SpongeBob","  Maybe if people could see how cute these puppies are,  they'd be more interested in taking 'em."
"Plankton"," Wait, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Ta-da!"
"Plankton"," I can't believe that actually worked."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks! You want him? He's free to a good home."
"Plankton"," Smoosh up some more puppies, SpongeBob. We are in business!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm smooshin'! I'm smooshin'!"
"Plankton"," Puppy? You came back?"
"Plankton","  Did you take this from your new owner? That is rude, puppy! Very, very rude!  Wait, you all took something...and brought it back to me? Hmm...  I don't need any of this junk."
"Plankton"," But perhaps there is something you can do for me,  like the Krabby Patty secret formula?  Anyone happen to steal a throat lozenge? No? Okay. Come on, pups! We've got some training to do—  Still rebooting, huh?"
"Plankton"," I might need someone to help train these amoebas."
"SpongeBob"," I'm glad you called me, Plankton. I am the best pet trainer in all of Bikini Bottom.  Why, Patrick is already housebroken."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yeah, he'll just use the litter box.  Bad Patrick.  Bad Patrick Star."
"SpongeBob"," To train a puppy, one must think like a puppy. "
"SpongeBob"," Woof, woof, woof! "
"Plankton"," Voilà! Eh?"
"SpongeBob"," Woof!"
"SpongeBob"," Woof, woof, woof!"
"Plankton"," Well, SpongeBob, after several grueling hours of training, the puppies are ready. Allow me to introduce them.  There's Demolitions Puppy."
"Plankton"," Acrobat Puppy."
"Plankton"," Identical Twin Puppies."
"Plankton"," And of course, Comic Relief Puppy."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, is this another plan to steal the secret formula?"
"Plankton"," Of course it is, and there's nothing you can do about it! "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Whoa!  You'll never get away with this, Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Oh, but I will get away with this, Plankton! I mean, SpongeBob. Allow me to explain."
"Plankton"," First, we'll need a distraction inside the Krusty Krab. That's where the Identical Twin Puppies come into play."
"Plankton"," Free from Krabs' watchful eye, Acrobat Puppy can begin his infiltration."
"Plankton"," Once Acrobat Puppy gets inside Krabs' office, he'll open the window for Demolitions Puppy."
"Plankton"," Then, Demolitions Puppy will blow the safe wide open."
"Plankton"," With the safe open, the formula is mine! And finally, just for fun, Comic Relief Puppy adds a dollop of humor."
"SpongeBob"," That's never gonna work."
"Plankton","  But it already has!  What do you think the puppies have been doing all this time? Now to open my prize! "
"Plankton"," Karen! Baby! "
"SpongeBob","  Woof, woof, ruff, ruff, woof, woof!"
"SpongeBob","  Woof, woof!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! Won't you ever learn? You're never gonna get the formula!"
"Plankton"," Come on, SpongeBob. Maybe we can work something out! I'll give ya 10% of my patty profits. Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Plankton. You leave me no choice. "
"Plankton","  Uh-oh."
"Patrick"," I believe this is yours."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Good boy, Patrick! You get a treat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay. No, wait! I—Get offa me! What are you—"
"Plankton"," Wait, puppy. Whoa, puppy!  Ooh! Cute...overload! Aah!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward. What do you think the nurse is doing to him in there?"
"Squidward"," It's called a ""checkup."" It's an invasion of your personal space that's good for you."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, nurse lady. I've never had a checkup before. It's so much fun!"
"SpongeBob","  Wow! Imagine if it was this easy to get your boating license!"
"Squidward"," Eh. The world shudders at the thought."
"Squidward"," Finally! Let's get this over with! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh...So, Boy-o...how was it in there? Anything I should be...terrified of?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, Mr. Krabs! Getting a checkup is the best! The nurse poked me  and prodded me  and jabbed me...  and pulled me  and twisted me.  And—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, okay. That's enough. "
"Squidward"," You want me to what?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh..."
"Squidward"," Hmph. "
"Squidward"," Could I get a little privacy?"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Your turn, Mr. K."
"Squidward"," Ha, ha! Looks like the old man is scared of getting his checkup."
"Squidward","  Not the...B.B.B.B.B!"
"SpongeBob"," You heard her. The..."
"Squidward"," Perhaps we could reach some sort of understanding."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday.  Everybody wins!"
"Squidward"," I was just gonna bribe her. "
"SpongeBob"," Yay! We get to spend the weekend together!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Dodged that bullet!"
"SpongeBob","  He's coming!"
"Squidward"," It says here the first part of Krabs' exam is the pinch test. We just need to do it in a way he doesn't know he's being tested!"
"SpongeBob"," Way ahead of ya!  We'll make him an offer he can't resist!"
"Squidward","  ""Free Money Inside."" Ha. Not bad."
"SpongeBob","  Come on, before he sees us! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh? Free money, hey?  Don't mind if I do!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Where's that money? I'm not feeling any money!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—"
"SpongeBob","  A baby's cheek!"
"SpongeBob"," Lucky that was a robot baby. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, quit fooling around!  Ow!  We need to test his ability to pinch something tough, you ninny!"
"SpongeBob"," Tough, huh? Gosh, the toughest thing I can think of is...Mr. Krabs himself!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ohhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Me achin' pinchers! And I didn't even get any money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hee hee! A penny! It's me lucky day! "
"Squidward"," Pinch test failed. Well, maybe he'll do better on the eye stalk test."
"Mr. Krabs"," Free suits? Oh, boy! "
"SpongeBob","  Welcome, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Step up here, and we'll begin."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?"
"SpongeBob"," Just grabbing some measurements..."
"SpongeBob"," Sir, try to keep still."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, there! Don't you need some other measurements? I mean, how 'bout my inseam? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, no, you can put that away, sir. I'm almost done."
"Mr. Krabs"," Aah! That's it!  Get off me, you terrible tailor!"
"SpongeBob"," Tell your friends about us!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not likely!"
"Squidward","  How'd he do?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he didn't make the cut."
"Squidward"," Of course.  Up next, it says we have to get him an X-ray of him. Any ideas?"
"SpongeBob"," I do have one plan that might work."
"SpongeBob","  Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography!  Preserve your precious punim for generations to come!  Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No charge, hey?  Well...I am very ""photogeneric."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's see...how do you start this thing? Oh! Here we go!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hoo! Gettin' kinda hot in here!  Should my underwear be on fire?"
"SpongeBob"," How many X-rays of Mr. Krabs do we need?"
"Squidward","  Just one. How many did you set it to take?"
"SpongeBob"," 25...thousand?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh...this is getting a little... Eh...thank you.  No more pictures, please. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, is his skeleton supposed to just fall apart like that?"
"Squidward"," Not at all. On to the next test."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh...oh... Oh, what a day."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, man, you look like you've had a rough day. How'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage? It's free."
"Mr. Krabs","  Free, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Free."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh. Okay. Let's get this over with. "
"Squidward"," Remember,  this is the cold-blooded test. Just take his temperature."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, best friend."
"Squidward"," Don't call me that."
"SpongeBob","  Boop!"
"Squidward","  Don't you do that!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, you—Oh, no, no, no, no, no! "
"Squidward"," How's the cold-blooded test going?"
"SpongeBob"," Great! He's in the freezer right now."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, you moron! Cold-blooded means your body is the same temperature as the water around it, not that you're actually cold!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward? Whyyyyyy?"
"Squidward"," Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm so sorry! We had to give you your physical without you knowing, or the Krusty Krab would've been shut down, and I'd have to get a real job!"
"SpongeBob"," All right! Final test! Shell durability! "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, no, no, no, no, no! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Now you see why I don't like checkups? "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Yes, you failed every test today, but Squidward and I will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's kick it up a notch! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa—no!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh—oh—no—oh, jeez—ohh!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know what we did wrong, Squidward. Mr. Krabs looks worse than before!"
"Squidward"," I guess that nurse is gonna close the Krusty Krab after all. I wish I could say it's been a pleasure working with you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, I'll miss you too! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit yer blubberin', boy. Me body may be mush, but me mind's sharp as a tack! And I...have a plan."
"Squidward"," Oh, um...yes. Of course he did. Um, unfortunately, our results were—"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, eaten!"
"Squidward","  Yeah, yeah. Um, anyway, we thought you could give old Mr. K another exam yourself. He's in his office."
"Mr. Krabs","  Whoo-hoo! We did it, boys! The Krusty Krab lives to see another day! Three cheers for a successful ruse!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's just make it one."
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never get me money! "
"Plankton"," Poof!  Alakazam! Your wish is my command!"
"Plankton"," Ow!  Hey, cut it out."
"Plankton"," It's my new scheme, Karen. I get Krabs to believe I'm a genie, I break this bottle, and then he's gonna put me in another bottle."
"Plankton"," No, Karen, you hope it's the secret formula bottle because then we'll rule the fast food world!"
"Plankton"," Ow!"
"Plankton","  Krabs should be heading out for work right about now. "
"Plankton"," Ow! "
"Plankton"," Whoa, whoa, whoa! "
"Plankton","  Ow, ow, ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, pick up that trash. "
"SpongeBob","  And a good morning to you, Mr. Krabs.  Whoa, it's so pretty."
"Plankton"," Oh, no, that's SpongeBob.  Oof, oof!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm going home for my lunch break, Mr. Krabs! "
"Plankton"," Ugh, nagging Neptune, the agony! "
"Plankton","  Whatever's happening, I'm sure it will be over soon."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, there's writing on this.  ""Rub bottle for magic genie."" Magic genie! I found a genie!"
"Plankton"," Ow, ow, hot, hot, hot, ow, ow, ow!"
"Plankton"," Yeow! Alakazam! I am the genie of the bottle. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah! Hi, genie! Are you really a genie?"
"Plankton"," Of course I am. Now, as a genie, I command you to take me to Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob","  You silly genie, you. You know it doesn't work like that. I'm your master now, and you have to grant me three wishes."
"Plankton"," What? For cryin' out loud. All right, what would you like?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing for me, thank you. That would be selfish. But I will make three wishes for my friends. Friendship is magical too."
"Plankton"," I'm gonna be sick."
"Plankton"," Ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"Squidward"," What do you want? It's my day off!"
"SpongeBob"," Well now it's your lucky day off. Make a wish, and the genie shall make it come true."
"Squidward"," Anything to get you away. I wish I for a golden clarinet that always plays beautifully. There."
"SpongeBob","  Say it. Mm!"
"Plankton","  Your wish is my command! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Squidward"," So we're done? "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Genie? "
"Squidward","  Well, I'll be an ocean monkey's uncle. The wish came true!"
"Plankton","  Good thing I spent that last summer in evil band camp."
"Squidward"," Oh, magic is real."
"Plankton"," Oh, Master? I have an idea! How about your next friend is Mr. Krabs?"
"SpongeBob"," My next friend is my best friend."
"Plankton"," Oh, for cod's sake."
"Patrick"," I wish...I wish...I wish..."
"Plankton"," Pick something, you bozo!"
"Patrick"," Well, sometimes I wish I had an extra head so that I'd have someone to talk to when you're at work."
"SpongeBob"," Aww."
"Plankton"," Pathetic. All right, your crummy wish is my command! Give me your hand, Jumbo. And the both of you, close your eyes."
"Plankton"," Alakazam!"
"Patrick","  Oh! My extra head! It's my wish come true! Oh, I'm gonna call you... Noggin."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hello, Noggin. Nice to meet you."
"Patrick"," Noggin, say hello to SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, he doesn't have to—"
"Patrick"," Noggin, you're embarrassing me. Say hello to SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," No, it's okay, Patrick."
"Patrick"," No, it's not okay!!"
"Plankton"," Leaping lungfish, can we go now?"
"Patrick"," Yes, go! Noggin here needs to be taught a painful lesson."
"Patrick"," Okay, Mister, you can—ow!  Ooh-ho-ho-ho! What are you do—? Ow, ow! Ow, Noggin, don't! Oh!"
"Plankton"," Finally! The Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob"," Of course, I was saving my last wish for good ol' Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton"," Ooh, izzy wizzy, let's get busy. "
"SpongeBob"," And so this would be the third and last wish I have, and it's all for you."
"Plankton"," Alakazam!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Child, can't you see I'm working here?  Take your toy and go play in the kitchen."
"SpongeBob","  But it's a real genie, and I—I saved the last wish for you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, stop your blubbering. I'll play along. I wish I had, um, $1,000."
"Plankton"," Your wish is my command!  You greedy crook. "
"Plankton"," I'd like to withdraw all my money, please."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, blow me down. It is a real genie! If I possess that bottle, I'll get three more wishes!"
"Squidward","  It's mine now! With three wishes, I could rule the music world!"
"Squidward","  What happened to you?"
"Patrick"," I don't wanna talk about it. I just want a new Noggin."
"Mr. Krabs"," Got it! Nyah, nyah, the genie's mine now!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look, a penny!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Money? Where? Ooh. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You hand me that bottle!!!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs! Oh, don't you all see? We shouldn't be fighting. Today we found out that magic is real. And that magic is magical and that magic makes you feel all sparkly and  carbonated inside."
"Squidward"," So how do we decide who gets the genie?"
"SpongeBob"," That's easy. We're gonna play a little game called Spin The Bottle! "
"SpongeBob"," So the rules are whichever one the bottle points to..."
"Patrick"," Has to kiss!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, they will win the bottle."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," And spin!"
"Squidward","  Ooh, ooh..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mm..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop on me, stop on me..."
"Squidward"," It's mine, it's mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's coming back! It's coming to me! Yes, it's mine! Whoo-hoo!  All right,  abracadabra!  Hocus pocus!  Open sesame!"
"Plankton","  Al—Alakazoom! Your swish is my com—my com—  ♪My wishy wishy wishy wish fish!♪ "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Alakazam, first thing I want is for everything in the Krusty Krab to turn into gold—even all the negative space."
"Plankton","  I can't do it! I can't keep up this charade anymore. I'm too mangled and mutilated!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I should have known! What was your lame-o plan this time?"
"Plankton","  I was gonna break that bottle so you would have to put me in the bottle with the secret formula."
"Plankton"," Calm down, you're insured."
"Squidward"," Who's this clod with my bottle?"
"Patrick"," Who's that bottle with my clod?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you guys, I—huh? Hmm, guess they worked it out. It's so heartwarming to live in a world with real magic. And the greatest magic of all is the way my friends are so close to each other."
"SpongeBob"," Yuck, this bottle of ketchup's gone bad. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I got some fresh ingredients for our new Krabby Soup! A half eaten Krabby Patty.  Two moldy pickles.  And some smashed potatoes that look like Squidward. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, did you get those ingredients from the trash?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Of course not!  That wouldn't be legal! I intercepted these items on their way to the trash. I want everybody in Bikini Bottom to buy my soup. Yuppies, guppies, puppies..."
"SpongeBob"," Hippies?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hippies? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. There's a group of hippies living out back by the hydrothermal vent."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hippies?  On my property?! Why I oughta!"
"Mr. Krabs","  All right, you long hairs, beat it! This here's private property!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, I don't care. You're trespassin'.  And litterin' paisleys!  Ha, ha! Back! Back you! Oh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," And keep running, you dead meats!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That should discourage those bohemians."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hold on there, lad. You might be overdoing the ingredients.  Huh, it's just broth."
"SpongeBob"," Huh. That's funny.  It was loaded with stuff a few minutes ago."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. Well, go ahead and add some more. We got customers waitin'!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm. Guess I bought the disappearing kind of potatoes."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Oh, hungry soup, eh? Let's see if you'll like onions!  Today's special is Onion Soup à la SpongeBob.  Whoa!  All right, listen, Soup, you want me to get tough?  All right, I'll get tough! I made you from scratch and I can unscratch you!  Whoa!"
"Squidward"," When you're done fighting with the food, we have an order for three soups."
"Squidward"," What's the problem?"
"Squidward"," Ha! Hippies in the soup? Ha! That's a new one. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Avast there, ye invertebrate! You're throwin' away me money! "
"Squidward","  Anyone else down there?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... Mr. Krabs, I think the soup might be haunted."
"Mr. Krabs"," Son, did you forget to pay your brain bill again?  Wha—What?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, you hippies!!  All right, you deadbeats! This is an eviction! You are to leave this soup immediately!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs, it's just so catchy."
"Squidward","  Why don't you just dump the soup out?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And lose all the money I've already put into it? Heck, no! They gotta go!"
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha using for bait?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Something hippies love. Long hair."
"Mr. Krabs"," I got one! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hippies can't resist playing with this little crochet foot bag."
"SpongeBob"," Neither can I!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, why are we in a drum circle?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's something that all hippies are required to participate in."
"SpongeBob","  My hands are starting to hurt!"
"Squidward"," Couldn't we have gotten softer drums?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa! I'm out! "
"Squidward"," Me too! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Get up, you tender palms! It's working!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, my claws!  My claws! I wish we had another drummer."
"SpongeBob"," I've got a drummer, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's your job to go into that soup and remove those hippies!"
"SpongeBob","  Hello, I'm SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Mmm.  Thank you! Oh, Mr. Krabs sent me here to tell you guys you have to leave."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Like this? "
"SpongeBob"," It's cool. Up is down. Down is up. It's all relative. Relative."
"Mr. Krabs"," Son, how's the eviction going?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wow, you're beautiful."
"Mr. Krabs","  You went too deep! You've gone full flower, child.  Oh, no!"
"Patrick"," What's happening, man?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing here?"
"Patrick"," Just tubing down the river of life, baby. "
"SpongeBob"," Does Mr. Krabs know you're in here?"
"Patrick","  No Krabs.  Can't stand those things!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah, suddenly everything's becoming very confusing! I—I—I know! I'll have a Krabby Patty. That always calms me down."
"SpongeBob"," Hello? Anybody here?  Whoa! How long was I in that soup?  Mr. Krabs, is that you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, I thought you split the scene, hipster."
"SpongeBob"," What happened here?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, I had to close down the Krusty Krab since you weren't around to make the Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Close down the Krusty Krab?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, I was just being a capitalist tool. But it's all groovy now. I'm a far out hippy. And I'm flyin' my free flag high."
"SpongeBob","  Making Krabby Patties was my number one favorite thing ever to do in the whole world!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Bummer, right? Let's dance our cares away, man!"
"SpongeBob","  Do you think that maybe we could reopen the Krusty Krab and go back to how things were?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I thought you'd never ask!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! But Mr. Krabs, what about our new hippy friends?"
"Mr. Krabs"," They say they need to be somewhere warm, right? I have an idea!"
"Squidward"," Oh, thanks, man.  Hippies!!!"
"SpongeBob","  This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick.  There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over. "
"Patrick","  Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes.  She's doing the old granny knot."
"Patrick","  All clear! No crime here."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP!  Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close. "
"Patrick","  I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!"
"Squidward","  I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!"
"Squidward"," I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons."
"SpongeBob","  Thank you."
"SpongeBob","  Let me help you carry this."
"Squidward"," No—wait, no!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh—your unmentionables."
"Patrick"," I won't mention is bra."
"Squidward"," It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh..."
"Squidward","  While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him!!! "
"SpongeBob","  This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. I've got a visual on a cab. Can you get a make on who the passenger is? Over. "
"Patrick","  I can't see anything through these unmentionables. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, he went inside! Patrick, wouldn't it be great to have another friend who could join our Junior Crime Breakers? Ooh, I gotta get a look at him!"
"Patrick","  We can blast him out. "
"SpongeBob"," No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man.  So, we gotta be sneaky."
"SpongeBob"," Shh! He must've gone upstairs."
"Patrick"," Well, how do we get up there?"
"SpongeBob"," ""Eye"" have just the thing!  Ow!"
"SpongeBob","  Ow!  D'ow!  Ow!  Oof!  Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie. "
"SpongeBob","  Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood! "
"Patrick"," Don't mind us. "
"Patrick"," Hamper sand—from my hamper."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob. He's not putting out any snacks for us."
"Patrick"," Don't mind if I do."
"Patrick","  He's all outta snacks!  Let's go."
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—"
"Patrick","  Evil villain Man Ray."
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man! It's Man Ray! He's right inside Squidward's...place.  Too late. Man Ray must've gotten to them."
"Patrick","  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy ice pops! They finally made them! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week!  Patrick, do you know what this means?"
"Patrick"," I'll have to wait a week for my Mermaid Man ice pop?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of... Evil!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is that..."
"Patrick"," I couldn't wait a week!  Yow!"
"Patrick"," Ah-ah-ah— "
"Patrick"," Good thing I'm so stealthy, huh, Mermaid Pants?  Ah! The stealth!"
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"SpongeBob","  Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons?  So stale, yet so deadly."
"Patrick"," I got my weapon!"
"SpongeBob","  ♪Dum-dah-dah!♪"
"SpongeBob"," Surrender, Man Ray!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, an evil holiday!"
"Patrick"," Prepare to be framed! "
"SpongeBob"," Here's a dessert that's sure to hurt! "
"Patrick"," No, no, no, no, no!"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Man Ray. I will snare you in my ""clara-net!"" "
"Patrick","  Uh...I can't think of anything!"
"SpongeBob"," Evil never takes a vacation!"
"SpongeBob"," Help yourself, Man Ray."
"Patrick"," Yeah, help yourself to pain! "
"Squidward"," Hello, Man Ray? The weather changed my plans. I'm coming home.  Not to worry, though. You'll get a full refund on the rent, so long as there is no damage to my place.  Hello?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers.  Huh?"
"Patrick"," Man, he really trashed this place."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!"
"Patrick"," Well, how do we do that?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14.  We have super saliva!"
"Patrick","  Ow!"
"Squidward"," Hello?  Oh, looks like my guest left already.  Home sweet...  Home."
"Squidward"," Gimme a quad—"
"Mr. Krabs","  Just eat the regular Krabby Patty  and stop wasting everybody's time!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that.  It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual.  ""The customer is always right, when they have money."""
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ketchup waster!  Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise."
"Squidward"," Your napkin. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Waster!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?  Ow! Mr. Krabs!  You gotta calm down!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh!  I'll murder-lize him!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get..."
"SpongeBob"," I feel so secure."
"Squidward"," What? You let him go? We're all dead!  Ow! The grill's still on! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break."
"Mr. Krabs"," I—I could use some me time."
"SpongeBob"," And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm..."
"SpongeBob"," Order up! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?"
"SpongeBob"," Psst, psst! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Larry. It'll be fun."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right! Ah! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. They normally eat like this! "
"Squidward"," What'll you have?"
"Squidward"," What else?"
"Squidward","  Hey!  Can I help you?"
"Squidward","  Here's your change."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Larry. No."
"SpongeBob"," I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back."
"SpongeBob"," Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the..."
"SpongeBob"," Larry?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry!"
"Squidward"," Whoa!"
"Squidward"," Let's get outta here!"
"SpongeBob"," Pardon my reach."
"Squidward"," Go on without me!  No, wait, don't."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired."
"Squidward"," Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place.  And I know just where to start the power shakes."
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it! "
"Squidward"," Wait, wait—what about me?"
"SpongeBob","  Butter!  Lard!  Mayonnaise. "
"SpongeBob"," And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise!  Here you go."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that failed. What now?"
"Squidward"," We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!"
"SpongeBob"," Gotcha! "
"Squidward"," Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now. "
"Squidward"," Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?"
"SpongeBob"," What are you all doing out here? You should just go home."
"SpongeBob"," Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them."
"SpongeBob"," Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," Fire!"
"Squidward"," Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Give into the flavor, Larry!"
"SpongeBob"," He's too fast. We need a distraction.  Here, use this. "
"SpongeBob","  Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape.  Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers."
"Squidward"," Somebody let me out of this thing already!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Home sweet home.  Hmm?"
"SpongeBob"," Order up! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Everything's just how I left it."
"SpongeBob"," Ah!  Hm... Mm-hm. It's scary, but...  Oh. Hello.  Hm..."
"Patrick"," Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Sir Patrick. How do you like my decorations?"
"Patrick"," Those are too cute for Halloween, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year."
"Patrick"," I thought it was about getting your pants scared off. Hey, where's your costume?"
"SpongeBob","  Close your eyes.  Okay. Open 'em.  ♪I'm a lovely flower♪ Ooh..."
"Patrick"," Oh, that's not scary either, SpongeBob. Wait, I'll show you what scary is. "
"Squidward","  Oh... There is no candy here..."
"Squidward"," Only onions!  Now move along. Ooh..."
"Patrick"," No candy. That is so scary. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob, why are you hiding in there? You'll miss all the scary stuff."
"SpongeBob"," I don't want to see the scary stuff, Patrick. Okay? I admit it. I love trick-or-treating, but I am too afraid to go out on Halloween!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, don't you know the old saying? ""The only thing you have to fear is...""  Yourself!  Aah! Stop staring at me like that! No!  See? It's all in your head, SpongeBob. You just have to remember one simple trick, and that is scary equals funny."
"SpongeBob"," Scary equals funny. Hm. Never looked at it that way before.  Doink. All right. I'll go out. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Here I am.  Just looking for cavities. Nope. None here. Oh, let's go out and get scared."
"Patrick"," Sure you can handle this, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'll be fine, Patrick. Really. But can we hold hands, just in case you get scared?"
"Patrick"," Deal."
"Sandy"," Welcome to my lab, SpongeBob and Patrick. I am the evil Dr. Franken-Cheeks."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Sandy. I didn't recognize you. "
"Patrick"," Uh, yeah, great costume."
"Sandy"," Oh, thanks, guys. Now, feast your fingers on my jars of horror!"
"Sandy"," Stick your hand in the jar and guess what's inside...If you dare!"
"SpongeBob"," Oy.  Ew. Oh. Ew, it feels like worm guts."
"Sandy"," Wrong!  It's just noodles."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'm savvy to this game, Sandy.  So these brains are probably a slimy head of lettuce, or maybe some boiled broccoli."
"Sandy"," Wrong! It's— Patrick? Get out of there."
"Patrick"," Don't stop, SpongeBob. That's the spot. Ah..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you really got me. "
"Sandy"," Ew!  How impolite of me! I forgot to introduce you to my little friend. "
"SpongeBob"," That's the most realistic fake monster I ever saw."
"Sandy","  Who are you calling fake?!  Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the fear of a scared SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come in and see the horrors of the Chum Bucket."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm Plankton! Ha, ha, ha, I'm evil! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  Scary."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you two laughing about? There's nothing funny about the food abuse that goes on at the Chum Bucket! You should be terrified!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs, but our new philosophy is ""scary equals funny."""
"Squidward"," Yeah, and funny divided by two idiots equals stupid."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't get it. When I was a kid, Halloween meant 24 continuous hours of screaming your head off! These kids today..."
"Plankton","  Come to the Chum Bucket, and witness the horrors of the Krusty Krab! You may never eat a Krabby Patty again! "
"SpongeBob"," Ready for more funny, Sir Clanks-a-lot?"
"Patrick"," I'm driving!  Charge! "
"Plankton"," Do the scary part."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, scary! "
"Plankton"," Scary? That's nothing.  Behold!  The horrors of the Krusty Krab.  Look down."
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"Patrick"," Ooh."
"Plankton","  No dawdling! Step right up!  The evil Mr. Krabs and his band of jolly, mindless fools stalk Bikini Bottom by night for delicious victims then drag their lifeless bodies back to the kitchen, and grind them into grinders!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Plankton, you are a panic."
"Plankton"," And guess what? You're eating it! Krabby Patties are people! They're people patties! You're eating people patties! "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, who would've thought I'd be laughing myself silly tonight? "
"SpongeBob"," Um...I guess so? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I was, until I found out that scary equals funny."
"SpongeBob","  I love this guy! "
"SpongeBob"," Sure. Can I bring a guest?"
"Patrick"," Where are we going, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny! "
"Patrick"," This music doesn't sound funny, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Sorry."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Hey!"
"SpongeBob","  That tickled!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh..."
"SpongeBob"," Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place! "
"Sandy","  Happy Halloween!  W—what? Where?"
"Squidward"," Huh? Oh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! Patrick! Help me!"
"SpongeBob","  That almost looks like Sandy."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"Plankton"," Patrick!"
"Squidward"," Help us!"
"SpongeBob","  That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton.  Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical.  Why aren't you laughing?  Patrick? What's wrong with you?"
"Patrick","  Help me, SpongeBob! My body's butt itches!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Is this really happening? Hey, this isn't funny."
"Patrick"," I was wrong, SpongeBob. Sometimes, scary equals scary!"
"SpongeBob"," Hm?  Yup. I got the same answer. Scary equals ""Ahh!"""
"SpongeBob"," Ahh!!"
"Plankton"," You know, I gotta say, pretty impressed with your whole evil presentation here. Nice work. I could use a guy like you to walk through walls. I take over the world, and we split it, 70-30. How's that grabbin' you?  Yes, master... "
"Patrick"," You can't talk about SpongeBob like that!"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah? If SpongeBob's so great, where is he? Huh?"
"Patrick"," The blue fire is so hot!"
"Sandy"," My puppet?"
"SpongeBob"," You let my friends go, buddy boy! "
"Plankton"," I think he could, master. You've never seen what's inside his brain!"
"Plankton"," I was in there once. It's too terrifying, even for ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures. "
"Sandy","  Ooh."
"Patrick","  Oh! I got my butt back! "
"Sandy"," I don't know what's inside that brain of yours, but I sure hope I never see it. Thanks, SpongeBob."
"Patrick","  But did we learn anything?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. We learned not to be afraid to never be scared of being afraid again. "
"Mr. Krabs"," My employee saved us! Party at the Krusty Krab! For a reasonable fee."
"Plankton"," Ugh. What happened? Whew. Must have been a nightmare."
"Patrick"," This, sir, is penosterous! I demand restitution! "
"Patrick"," I want to speak to the manager. I bet he knows where the balloons are."
"Patrick"," Balloons? Aw, it's just a stupid old bus."
"Patrick","  Hey, mister? You dropped your hat."
"Patrick"," Okay, I'll... keep it warm for you. "
"Patrick"," Ooh, I could be a tour guide?"
"Patrick","  Uh...uh! Yes, I am.  All right, everyone, settle down. My name is Patrick and I'll be your tour guide to the wonderful world of Bikini Bottom. Please take small children firmly by the hand. And we're walking, we're walking..."
"Patrick"," Our first landmark is the kissing stone of the ancients. It is said to bring good luck to all who smooch it. "
"Patrick"," Another ancient and mysterious landmark is the hole that I dug yesterday."
"Patrick"," It fits my butt!  Now you try it."
"Patrick"," On your left is a kid who, legend has it, used to have an ice cream cone."
"Patrick"," This guy called me a bad word once."
"Patrick"," I thought it was meatloaf!"
"Patrick"," Coming up ahead is the home of SpongeBob SquarePants, the fry cook."
"Patrick"," We have begun our descent."
"Patrick","  Everyone please gather all your belongings and follow me single file."
"Patrick"," This is my best friend SpongeBob. As you can see, he sucks his thumb when he sleeps.  Oh—wait, that's me. "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, I like sweet potatoes, thank you."
"Patrick"," My internal alarm clock says it's time for morning lunch. Everyone, follow me. And we're tiptoeing... tiptoeing..."
"Patrick"," The tour will resume shortly, everyone. And also, uh, I think the mayo is spoiled."
"Patrick"," This is Squidward the cashier."
"Patrick"," And yes, those moles are huge."
"Squidward"," And stay out! "
"SpongeBob","  Late for work, late for work. Late for work.  Late for work, late for work!"
"Patrick"," Ooh, time for second lunch!  Everyone, follow that Bob!  Yah!  And we're running. We're running..."
"Patrick"," This is the world-famous Krusty Krab! "
"Plankton"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Now, this is Plankton, who's always trying to steal the Krabby Patty. So, we step on him! "
"Plankton","  Ouch!"
"Patrick"," Try it, everyone. It's fun."
"Patrick"," Next stop is the Krusty kitchen."
"Patrick"," If you look to your left, you'll see SpongeBob preparing his fresh and delicious ingredients to be cooked alive."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, just doing my thing. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, shucks, I'm just getting warmed up.  Uh-huh! Yeah! Eh, eh?  Ooh! "
"Patrick"," And this magical place is where all the food ends up.  And if you do this...  This happens!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And stay away from me toilets!"
"Patrick"," And the best is yet to come!"
"Patrick","  If you look to your left..."
"Patrick"," You'll miss everything on your right."
"Sandy","  Oops, almost forgot my plant food. "
"Patrick"," Under your belly is the outside of Sandy's treedome."
"Patrick","  Don't worry. I have a key.  Everyone, watch your step.  Sandy Cheeks and her tree both have roots in Texas. The dome overhead was designed to keep out the water.  This makes the air too dry to survive in...  For water-breathers like us. Luckily, we all have on our water helmets, or else we'd be in big trouble right about now.  Uh-oh!  And we're running, we're running! 'Cause we're expiring, expiring! "
"Patrick"," Everyone, follow my belly."
"Sandy"," Aw, looks like you plant critters could use a little water.  Whoa!  Patrick!"
"Patrick"," This will probably be the last stop on our tour.  Each one of these gravestones has an amazing secret underneath.  There's people living down there! "
"Patrick"," This is my old pal Ribeye, everyone. Ribeye, this is everyone!"
"Patrick"," The management strongly advises that you... run away!"
"Patrick","  I'm sorry, Ribeye!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you gotta hide! There's an angry mob...  Coming for you. They're here."
"Sandy"," They done busted my dome!"
"Squidward"," They got pictures of me naked!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No one wants to see your moles."
"Mr. Krabs"," Officer!  That guy's camera took pictures of me Krabby Patty ingredients. And I want that film, before Plankton gets it!"
"Plankton"," Way ahead of you, Krabs. But there's no film in this camera at all."
"Patrick"," Um...uh...  And we're backing away, and backing away, and backing away!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Yeah!  Uh-huh, uh-huh!  Uh-huh!  Ooh!  Uh-huh! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I need—  Whoa. Sponge—"
"SpongeBob"," Patty, no!  Oh, I can't quite reach it."
"Mr. Krabs","  Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights.  Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept.  There you are!  Good as new!  Hold on, patty! I've got you!  No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, SpongeBob. Time to come back down and get to work so I can garnish your wages for wasting that patty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nonsense, boy-o. Just climb on down!"
"SpongeBob","  No, I'm good! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I order you to come down here immediately!"
"Sandy"," Don't worry, I'll get him down with my newest invention Extend-O-Boots. I just press this button, and...  Whoa!  Sorry, I haven't worked out all the kinks yet!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa-oh-oh!  Whoa!"
"Squidward"," What the—"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, uh... anybody else got an idea?"
"Patrick"," It's okay, I got him!  Hey, SpongeBob. Whatcha doing wa-a-ay up here?  Let's climb down now. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead.  I just can't do it. It's too far down! "
"Patrick"," Aw, don't worry, SpongeBob. Your old pal Patrick has another plan to get you off this roof."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Patrick"," Sure. Just do what I do.  Hm...  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there.  Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone!  Ah!  Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you. "
"Squidward"," Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good.  Huh?! "
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, maybe he's hungry.  Come on, Squidward! Eat your...  Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp!  Ow-ow-ow-ow!  Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep.  Oh, I wish I had my bed...  Hey, that gives me an idea."
"SpongeBob","  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Perfect. Good night...  nobody."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yoo-hoo, SpongeBob! Time to wake up!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  I've come up with a solution for your little roof problem, boy-o! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now you can cook even if you can't get back down."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now start making me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again!  Something still doesn't feel right, though."
"SpongeBob"," Perfect! Just like my old kitchen.  I'm ready!  Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers?  Eureka!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, calm down, everyone. I'm sure we can figure something out that doesn't involve violence or...refunds."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! I better make more room up here."
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser.  But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming! "
"SpongeBob"," Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here."
"Squidward"," Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ten more patties, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Mr. K."
"SpongeBob"," Aw... "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, no—me money! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, wait, don't go!  A little wind never hurt anyone!"
"Patrick"," Whoa, whoa!  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's beautiful, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob","  Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing!  Whoo! "
"SpongeBob"," Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!"
"SpongeBob"," And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!"
"Squidward"," Time to go home already?  Ow. "
"SpongeBob"," Mm, ooh!  Order's up!"
"Squidward"," Aah! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Another pair of perfect patties. Hand 'em over, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Wait  Tink.  Okay, now they're perfect. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay. Enough.  Everybody gets it. Our patties are perfect. Keep them orders coming, boyos!  Orders up! Two Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," Something wrong with the patties, sir? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh.  New, huh? We've been waiting to test our, uh, our new menu! Uh, how'd you like to be the first to try it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Come with me, boyo. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! What is this place?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's me secret lab where I experiment on food."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs, this looks like madness."
"Mr. Krabs"," You think this is mad? Ooh, wait 'till you see... this!"
"SpongeBob"," Yipe!"
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy? What are you doing down here?"
"Sandy"," I'm moonlighting as a molecular gastronomist."
"SpongeBob"," What? A maladowin-a-gas-a-whatalist?"
"Sandy","  Eugene here is paying me to science up his menu."
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, I'm in a hurry. You have this special project."
"Sandy"," Well, it's a work in process."
"Sandy"," There it is! Your new patty!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hm."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, no! You can't improve the Krabby Patty! It's perfect perfection that cannot be perfected upon! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, right. Sensitive to time.  Make me 200 of these, pronto!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go, gentlemen. Two brand new patties. "
"Sandy","  Step right up and get your new, improved patties!"
"Sandy","  Ah! Uh."
"Mr. Krabs","  Hm. A little bit different, but they taste familiar.  Well, that wasn't familiar. "
"SpongeBob"," You feeling okay? 'Cause there's sesame seeds growing out of your back."
"SpongeBob","  What's going on?"
"Sandy","  Ooh. Ehh, I never shoulda eaten four.  Uh! Ah!  Huh! "
"SpongeBob"," The new patties! They're making everyone change!"
"Squidward","  Uh! Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," I gotta get out of here! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eat me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eat us."
"SpongeBob"," All original Krabby Patty, why did we forsake your perfect recipe?  Ohh. "
"Sandy"," Chow down, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Um, no thanks.  Already ate. See?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe I'll be safe in here till all this blows over."
"SpongeBob","  Perch Perkins, how did you know I was in here?"
"Squidward"," Take a bite! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Who's the third person not affected?"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton. The Chum Bucket! "
"Plankton"," There it is, Karen. 152 bags of Grade B pre-cooked chum and not a single customer's come through that door."
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, what are you doing? How are the customers supposed to get in now?"
"SpongeBob"," Those aren't customers out there, Plankton. They're all Krabby Patty zombie monsters! And they're forcing everybody to eat them! You and I are the last two survivors!"
"Plankton"," Krabby Patty zombies? Heh. I'll believe it when I see it."
"Plankton"," Okay, I believe it!"
"Plankton"," Karen!"
"Plankton"," No!  Hey!"
"Plankton"," No! Wait! I don't want—  Have a slider."
"SpongeBob"," Oh!  Stay back! I've got sporks!"
"Patrick"," Boy, do I feel better!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's it! Chum is the cure."
"Patrick"," Oh, a patty. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," No, eat chum. Wah! "
"SpongeBob","  Yes! Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe I should up the dosage!  Ahh!  And three, two—"
"Squidward"," Oh, my cranium."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh boy, so much for lab-grown patties."
"SpongeBob"," You see, Mr. Krabs, some things don't need scientific reengineering to be delicious.  The original Krabby Patty is perfect just the way it is."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're darn tootin', they do! And for the next three minutes, all vintage Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab are...double the price!"
"Plankton"," Wait! Don't leave now! Who's gonna clean up this mess?!"
"Patrick"," Uhh!  Have some. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who needs a bathroom when I can shave and drive to work at the same time? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Watch where you're going, you miniscule maniac! "
"Plankton"," Get bent, Krabs!"
"Plankton"," Outta my way, you fool! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! "
"Plankton"," Eh?  Huh?  Yeow! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ohh, shrimp! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ehh, you cause a little 300 boat pile-up, and they send you to boating school. Eh, well, better make the most of it and grab the best desk. Ahh.  Ohh!"
"Plankton","  Easy with that hienie, Eugene. This is my desk!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You want that desk? You can have it.  I'll just take this one."
"Plankton"," Oh, you want me to take this garbage desk so you can grab that prime seat and get all the teacher's attention? Well, forget it. That one's mine. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah!  Dibs!  Grr!! Aha!"
"Plankton","  This one's mine! Yikes!"
"Plankton"," And this one's mine!"
"Plankton"," This one's mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, it's mine!"
"Plankton"," Mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mine!"
"Plankton"," Mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, sorry cutie."
"Plankton"," Suck up."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohh, it's on!"
"Plankton"," Ohh, bring it!"
"Plankton"," Brass knuckles, huh? Respect."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, sorry!  Sorry! Oh, sorry! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! That's me! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, cool camera. Can I see? "
"SpongeBob","  Ehh. Ah. Whoa. Sorry I'm late."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mrs. Puff. I was so excited for class, I must've forgot "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh, this is so great having you in class with me, Mr. Krabs. 'Cause now, you're not only my boss, you're also my classmate and, dare I say it, my best friend.  Aww,  make that two best friends."
"Plankton"," Get off!"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, I think someone is nervous about being the new kid in class. Well, no worry, I'll show you all the ropes.  Did you know that every time you do something good, Mrs. Puff gives you a star sticker? "
"Plankton"," Stickers? I'm an adult. I don't care about stickers."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, me neither. No matter how cool and shiny they are.  I'm gonna have so many stars, Puff will have to get a bigger board! "
"Plankton"," Forget it, Eugene, I am going to be the star pupil!"
"Plankton"," Oh, nothing. I just thought you could use a little snack. Winkety blink."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, is someone hungry? Ta-da!"
"Plankton"," How about some melon? "
"Mr. Krabs"," I want those stickers!"
"Plankton"," Forget it, Krabs! They're mine! Ah!"
"Plankton"," Ahh, I'm through wasting time here.  Straight from the source. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Aw, but I want more shiny stars!"
"Plankton"," No, I do!"
"Plankton","  Beautiful stars."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I want some.  Doink! Ehh, ehh."
"SpongeBob"," Ohh."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, the two new students are— "
"Mr. Krabs"," Nothing. Nothing's going on."
"Plankton"," We swear."
"Plankton"," Slowly and carefully. Got it. "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, that's the nicest thing you've ever said about me. "
"SpongeBob"," Yikes! Come back, boat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey!  Ow, ow, ow, ooh, ow!"
"Plankton","  Can't catch me, Eugene! I'm the number one driver! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, good for you, Plankton!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't congratulate him, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, classmates support each other and he just said he's number one."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah. Then let's see him do this!"
"Plankton"," That's easy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Never!"
"Plankton"," I'm a god in this boat, on my way to heaven!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Top of the world!"
"Plankton"," Oh, come on! Don't we at least deserve some credit for not getting hurt? I mean, that was crazy dangerous!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, it was!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey guys, I finished that—"
"Plankton"," Wha—what happened?"
"Plankton"," Complications? What complications?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, what's all the screaming up there?  Forget class, now we can be together forever! "
"Squidward","  You're just filthy trash!  Get in the bag! Stupid trash!   Trash juice!                                                                                  "
"SpongeBob","  Hey, maybe we should use another trash bag, Mr. Krabs.  This one's kinda full.                                                                                       "
"Mr. Krabs","  Forget it, boyo!  I'm not paying for another garbage bag! Just put your back into it.                                                                         "
"SpongeBob","  Back, ey? Like this? "
"Squidward","  Ooh, let me help you with that. "
"SpongeBob","  Let me try! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Keep it up, it's working! "
"SpongeBob","  Keeping it up, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't know what you're talking about sir."
"Mr. Krabs","  Whatever you say inspector."
"Squidward","  I am a culinary genius, no?  Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward.  Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish.  Stay warm, my little Squidy.  Le oww!  Typical, I always forget something."
"Squidward"," Ugh!"
"Squidward"," A sea bunny? "
"Squidward","  Ow!"
"Squidward","  That voracious vermin is ruining my French chef fantasy.  Why—ah! "
"Squidward"," Grr!  Oh—oh, no, no, no, no! I have a ticklish core! "
"Squidward"," Oh. "
"Squidward"," My roast à la Squidward!"
"Squidward"," What the—"
"Squidward"," Oof! "
"Squidward"," I declare war on bunnies!"
"Squidward","  I am going to bury that bunny! "
"Patrick","  Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here."
"Squidward"," Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap. "
"Squidward","  Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!"
"Squidward"," Did you have to catch him that easily?"
"SpongeBob","  I demand the release of this poor woodland creature. He's got rights too, you know."
"Squidward"," This is none of your business, SpongeBob, go away!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray! "
"Squidward"," I'm warning you, SpongeBob. Keep that filthy animal away from my—"
"SpongeBob","  Vegetables! That's what you like, isn't it, bunny? We'll see what we got in the fridge."
"SpongeBob"," Whoops, I'm out of veggies. But I got something even better.  Gary's food! Yay!  Does bunny wunny like his dinny winny?"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back."
"SpongeBob","  Bunny wunny! I've got a surprise for you—"
"SpongeBob"," I'm gonna have to chew-proof this whole house fast!  Hot sauce ought to do the trick."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? No, no, no, no!"
"SpongeBob"," My comic books!"
"SpongeBob"," I gotta get rid of all that hot sauce."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, oh, oh, oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Here we are! Water supply—check. Trampoline for hopping—check. Buckteeth sharpener—check. And an adding machine for multiplying.  Triple check-aroonie! Now the bunny will be more than happy to stay in his cage. Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Doesn't like cage...  Check."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, bunny, don't go in there! You'll get lost! I need my jellyfishing net. Where did I put that thing?  Probably dropped it in here somewhere. Nyah, nyah—ah, got it! "
"Patrick"," Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, did you fall between the cushions again?"
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob, I fell between the cushions.  But I have a solution to your bunny problem. I love the hunt!"
"SpongeBob","  No, no! No, don't! Please don't! That's my— All right, Patrick, that's enough hunting. You can come out now."
"Patrick"," I can't see where I'm going. How do I get out of here?  SpongeBob, where are I? "
"SpongeBob"," Stay where you are, Patrick! I've got an idea. To the pet shop!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you!  Patrick! I bought a second bunny to lure the first bunny out of hiding."
"Patrick"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Patrick, I see you. "
"Patrick","  Thanks, buddy.  Aww, bunnies!"
"SpongeBob"," One, two... Three?"
"Patrick"," More bunnies!"
"SpongeBob","  Yay!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-oh.  Patrick, the hunt is on! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!"
"Squidward","  This is the last carrot.  C'est la vie.  One more step, and I will spit you on a roast! I mean, roast you on a spit!  Oh, oh, what's happening?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Yeah. We're here to help!"
"Squidward"," They're growing! "
"Squidward"," Hello, Animal Control? Save me!!"
"Squidward"," Get out of my house! Gah!  That'll get them out."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry about your house, Squidward."
"Patrick"," Yeah. We just heard."
"Squidward","  I'm a bunny now!  I'm a bunny now! I'm a bunny now!"
"Squidward","  I'm a bunny now!  I'm a bunny now!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh.  Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!"
"Squidward","  Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone! "
"Squidward","  Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then. "
"Mr. Krabs","  And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?"
"Squidward"," Can't practice anywhere in this town.  Bunch of tasteless clowns! "
"Patrick","  Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh!  Ow! What is that noise?  Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you! "
"Squidward","  What are you–  Hm? Uh? Hm?  Oh!"
"Patrick"," You're welcome!"
"Squidward","  It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music. "
"Squidward","  Are you ready, my dear? We've got the– "
"Squidward","  And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place.  And that's when I saw him, my first suspect.  When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%.  He had to be involved.  SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?"
"Squidward"," I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me  where!  It!  Is!"
"SpongeBob","  I  Don't!  Know!  It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it,  see? There's room for one more."
"Squidward","  His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool."
"SpongeBob"," You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet."
"Squidward"," I don't have friends. I have suspects."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet?  So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?"
"Squidward"," Try not to get in the way."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean...  All right, I'll partner up with you this time.  Huh?"
"Squidward","  My...  partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little ""Good cop, bad cop"" would get his jaw flapping so I–"
"SpongeBob","  Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?"
"Squidward","  Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!"
"SpongeBob","  Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the–"
"Squidward"," Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?  Now, where were you earlier–"
"SpongeBob"," You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal? "
"Squidward"," What are you doing, SpongeBob?  Manicure?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh? "
"SpongeBob","  Makeover? "
"Squidward"," Warm blanket? "
"SpongeBob"," New shoes? "
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Enough!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, check out the dame."
"Mr. Krabs"," What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, uh, we're playing ""Good cop, good cop."" Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!"
"Squidward","  We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove! "
"SpongeBob","  Good contours.  And still warm. Story checks out. "
"Squidward"," All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time.  Come on, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Mm, hmm. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!"
"Squidward","  We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside."
"Squidward","  Bubble Bass!  Ow!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, wait!  Let him handle this."
"Squidward","  It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys."
"SpongeBob"," Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?"
"SpongeBob"," I am so sorry for your loss."
"Squidward"," I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end. "
"Squidward","  Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick Star?"
"Squidward"," Um, yeah, how'd you know?"
"Patrick"," Hey, guys!"
"Squidward"," Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?"
"Patrick"," I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!"
"Squidward"," Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!"
"Patrick"," Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish. "
"SpongeBob","  Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief..."
"Squidward"," Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!"
"SpongeBob"," Right behind you, pal.  Huh?  Whoa!"
"Squidward","  When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones."
"Squidward"," My baby!  Ha!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play! "
"SpongeBob"," Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music."
"Patrick"," We should solve another mystery now."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went?  Huh? "
"Patrick"," Solved!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward! "
"Squidward","  And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective."
"SpongeBob","  You dance divinely."
"Patrick"," Shall we?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I love this song!"
"Squidward"," Why are you nitwits in my house?"
"Patrick"," And we don't want to be bored!"
"SpongeBob"," We wanna have fun."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward. Give us something fun to do. Please?"
"Patrick"," Oh, let's play lunch!"
"SpongeBob"," No problem. I'll whip up some grub."
"Squidward"," Leave my kitchen alone!"
"SpongeBob"," Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here."
"Squidward","  Oh! That's it. How would you two like to go on a... scavenger hunt?"
"Patrick"," What's a scavenger hunt?"
"SpongeBob","  ""A party game in which participants work in teams to collect a list of miscellaneous objects!"" Scavenger hunt, yeah! What's first on the list, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Um, oh, uh, well, let's see.  Bring back the rare Desert Sandwich."
"SpongeBob"," Sandwich?"
"SpongeBob","  Sandwich? Sandwich? "
"Squidward","  Not in here! The sandwich is only found deep in the Bikini Badlands, out there!"
"Patrick","  Oh."
"Squidward","  Phew. I am a genius."
"SpongeBob"," Goodlands, half a league."
"SpongeBob"," Badlands, 20,000 leagues?"
"Patrick"," So...thirsty.  Oh."
"SpongeBob","  It's no use. We'll never find the rare Desert Sandwich."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! We did it! We brought back the first item!"
"Squidward"," Sand? "
"Squidward","  Witch?  Oh, good grief! Not that kind of sand witch! The Desert Sandwich has tomatoes and bread and—and—mayo."
"Squidward"," Oh, looks pretty good.  Get it off! Get it off! "
"SpongeBob"," What's next on our scavenger hunt, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Hmm...oh.  Mm-hmm. Your next item is the Boxing Begonia!  It only grows in the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench."
"Squidward"," Ha. That'll keep them out of my hair.  Oh."
"Patrick"," It's so straight-down-y."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick. A scavenger is always prepared.  The rope is too short! We need another one!"
"Patrick","  Here!"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick! Where'd you get another rope?"
"Patrick"," From that rock!"
"SpongeBob"," Found it!"
"SpongeBob"," We're back!"
"Squidward"," What? But—but it's not possible!  Boxing Begonia? It's beautiful."
"Patrick"," The champ takes a swift uppercut to the jaw. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward is against the ropes. A left, a right."
"Patrick"," How can a man stand it?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and the champ is down!"
"Patrick","  The winner!"
"Squidward"," How do you keep finding everything?"
"SpongeBob","  You have to keep your skull... numb."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we're numbskulls!"
"Squidward","  Your next mission is to find  the Loch Ness Monster and bring him back...alive."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, the Loch Ness Monster!"
"Patrick"," Oh, so good! Oh, so good!  What color?"
"Squidward","  Doesn't matter! Good luck!  They'll never find it. And if they do, it'll eat them.  It's a win-win. "
"SpongeBob"," Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!"
"Patrick"," How are we gonna find a monster in the dark? I can't see anything."
"SpongeBob"," We don't have to find it. It'll find us. "
"Squidward","  I'm the greatest.  And here comes the worst. "
"Squidward","  The lo—lo— The Loch Ness Monster! How did you find it?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, simple.  Bagpipes."
"Squidward","  It likes bagpipe music? "
"Patrick"," No, it hates it."
"SpongeBob"," But it sure loves to eat 'em!"
"Squidward"," Oh, brother!  Brother..."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, just one more."
"Squidward","  Well, all right, it's—it's impossible, but...  if only you could find my long lost brother."
"Squidward","  I haven't seen him since he was a baby."
"SpongeBob"," Aww."
"Patrick"," Baby with a moustache."
"Squidward","  He was an early bloomer."
"SpongeBob"," What was his name?"
"Squidward"," Name, huh? Um..."
"SpongeBob"," ""Um?"" Aw, what a pretty name."
"Squidward","  If I could just see him again...  No."
"SpongeBob","  That's so sad!"
"Patrick"," Even my armpits are crying! "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick, we've got some extreme scavenging to do!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"Squidward","  Oh, thank you.  I'm free! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's brother!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward's brother!  Squidward's brother? "
"Patrick"," Squidward's brother? "
"SpongeBob","  He's right here! Squidward's brother!"
"Patrick"," The rascal shaved his moustache!"
"Squidward","  Good grief. "
"SpongeBob","  Um! Squidward's brother!"
"Patrick","  Squidward's brother!"
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Tentacles?  Mrs. Tentacles, you're Squidward's mother. You must know where Squidward's brother is."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, that's so sad. Squidward wanted a baby brother so badly he imagined one."
"Patrick"," Oh, man. Now it'll take even longer to find him."
"SpongeBob"," Hm?  Oh, I'm getting a brainstorm!"
"Patrick"," I've got you, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, let it flow.  Ooh, I have a plan."
"Squidward"," Oh, I love my two new homes. And best of all, I haven't heard from those idiots in months! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward. We found your brother."
"Squidward","  You urchin brains! I never had a brother!"
"SpongeBob"," You do now!"
"Patrick"," Two brothers! Us!"
"Squidward"," What are you morons talking about?"
"SpongeBob","  Come on in, Mama."
"Squidward","  Ma—Mama?"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, I don't know what I love more, Squidward, feeding people Krabby Patties during the day, or cleaning up their mess at night."
"Squidward","  Are you kidding me? Look at all this garbage those animals left behind. Hm."
"Patrick","  One man's garbage... "
"SpongeBob","  So much gum! Ooh, this is gonna be fun. Ooh-wah! "
"Squidward"," Ow! Hey, watch it— "
"Squidward"," Ah! Urchin!"
"SpongeBob"," That's no urchin, it's a Krabby Patty."
"Squidward"," Yuck. A rotten Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward! You can't throw out a Krabby Patty. That is just wrong."
"Squidward"," But this one is rotten."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, simple Squidward...  No Krabby Patty can ever truly be rotten. Here, look... "
"Squidward"," Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Mmm... "
"Squidward","  Oh, that looks delicious. Why don't you take another bite?"
"SpongeBob"," No thanks. Uh, it's so delicious, I think I'll save the rest for later. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patty, you stay where you are. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I—I'm all right.  Yoo-hoo! What are you?"
"SpongeBob"," New best friend? I like the sound of that."
"SpongeBob"," Whee!  That's what I call a hug. "
"SpongeBob"," So tender."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Cuddle E. Hugs."
"SpongeBob","  Wow!  Wow!"
"SpongeBob","  What a great night!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Gary. Say hello to my new best friend, Cuddle E. Hugs."
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Gary. Bed time."
"SpongeBob"," Here's my room. You can take the bed, if you want."
"SpongeBob","  Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Ha! Ha! Whoo-hoo! Hooray!  You are the absolute best at snuggles."
"SpongeBob"," How'd you sleep, Cuddle E.?  Oh, good morning, Gary. Hey, have you seen Cuddle E. Hugs anywhere?"
"SpongeBob"," Where could he have gone? Aw, what if I never see him again or feel his furry embrace?  Maybe a bite of Krabby Patty will make me feel better. "
"SpongeBob","  I don't feel so good. I must miss Cuddle more than I thought."
"SpongeBob","  You're still here!"
"SpongeBob"," Yee-hee!  Aw. Wow! That kiss was even more tender than the first one."
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Gary? Come here. "
"SpongeBob"," You should meet my other friends. They are gonna love you. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh—ooh, there's my buddy, Squidward! You're gonna love him. He's funny and nice and very polite. Hey, Squidward! Hi! I said hey, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Please get out of my way, and stop talking to me."
"SpongeBob"," See, Cuddle E.? He said please. I told you he was polite."
"Squidward"," Who are you talking to?"
"SpongeBob"," My new best friend. Wanted you to meet him."
"Squidward","  I don't have time for your stupid games. Now move it! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah!  Sorry about that. I—I don't know what's gotten into him today."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, your furry tummy feels like home."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, why are you hugging the air?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, I'm not hugging the air. I'm hugging Cuddle E. Hugs."
"Patrick"," Uh, mm...  Are you playing some kind of trick on me? There's no one there."
"SpongeBob"," Course there's someone here. He's my new best friend."
"Patrick","  But I'm your best friend."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes, you are, but so is Cuddle E. Hugs, and I have enough love in my heart for both of you."
"Patrick"," No! I want all your love!  Give me it!  SpongeBob's my best friend! Mine!  Give me his love!  No! No, no! "
"Sandy","  What's up with Patrick? He looks madder than a rattlesnake in a room full of rocking chairs."
"SpongeBob"," I just tried to introduce him to my friend, Cuddle E. Hugs, and he went crazy! In fact, everyone's acting weird. They're all pretending they can't see him."
"Sandy"," Well, where is this new friend of yours?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, not you too, Sandy! He's standing right there!"
"Sandy"," Huh?  Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but I don't see anyone."
"SpongeBob"," He's the giant hamster, right there! "
"Sandy"," Oh, I get it. He's your  imaginary friend."
"SpongeBob"," But he's not imaginary! He's real!"
"Sandy"," Oh, no need to get so fiery, SpongeBob. It's okay to have an imaginary friend. Lots of people do. You two have fun, ya hear? "
"SpongeBob"," What is going on around here? I was so excited to introduce you to my friends, but now they're all acting strange."
"SpongeBob"," There is?"
"SpongeBob"," Magic sandwich? What magic sandwich?"
"SpongeBob"," You mean the moldy Krabby Patty I found at work?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... Maybe I should share my magic sandwich with my friends. That way, they can see you, and see how awesome you are!"
"SpongeBob","  Tummy...  Tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy."
"SpongeBob"," There! Enough for everyone."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?  Aged Krabby Patties here! Get your artisanal aged Krabby Patties here!  Did I mention they were free?"
"Sandy"," Mmm. "
"SpongeBob"," Do you see him, Patrick? Do you see Cuddle E. Hugs?"
"Patrick","  Yes! Oh, he's glorious!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what are you doing giving away free food? Are you cra—"
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't resist the fuzzy."
"SpongeBob"," No, Cuddle E. Hugs, no!"
"Squidward","  Sorry, I'm late, I...  Um...back to bed. "
"SpongeBob"," I thought we were friends! "
"SpongeBob","  What happened?"
"Patrick","  Oh... Well, your friend ate me is what happened! Not cool!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, grumble!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, everyone."
"Sandy"," You need to imagine your friends more carefully, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," I just don't get it. Why did he act like that last night? I thought we were BFFs. I need to talk to him."
"SpongeBob"," Don't ""bro"" me, Cuddle E. Hugs! You embarrassed me last night, and you ate all my friends! Why would you do that?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Well, why didn't you say so? Here, have the last of my patty."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, one more book, then you go to sleep, 'kay?"
"Patrick"," 'Kay."
"SpongeBob"," This one is called ""You Can Be Anything."""
"Patrick","  I can be anything?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure you can, pal.  You can be a firefighter...  You can be a doctor...  You can be a cowboy."
"Patrick"," That's what I want to be!"
"SpongeBob"," Cowboy. Great choice."
"Patrick"," No, no, no, no, no!  That."
"SpongeBob"," A horse?  Buddy, I don't think you want to be a horse."
"Patrick"," You said I can be anything, and—and I want to be a horse!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure, sure, you can be a horse.  Nighty-night, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," A horse.  A horse. "
"SpongeBob","  Not now, Gary. Give me a few more minutes.  What? Uh, Gary? "
"SpongeBob","  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, horsey!  Patrick, you were right! You can be a horse."
"SpongeBob"," Easy there, big fella.  Easy..."
"SpongeBob"," Ah!  That's a good horsey. Hmm, ""horsey."" That's not right. You need a name! I think I'll call you... Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!  Ride 'em, cowboy!"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, bucking bronco."
"SpongeBob"," Safety first.  Giddy up, Patrick!  Looking good, Ms. Sandy."
"Sandy"," Thank you. And the horse you rode in on?"
"SpongeBob","  Morning, old timer."
"SpongeBob"," Sure, but be gentle."
"Squidward"," What's all the hubbub out here?  What the?  So Patrick's a horse now? Ha-ha! Your phony baloney pony's more like an old gray mare.  Sorry to say, but, uh, this one's ready for the glue factory. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What kind of hub— What are you doing violating me personal space? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Horsey rides! Kids love horseys. Great idea having Patrick play pony. I'll charge these kids ten bucks a ride and cash in big time!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs, I think Patrick will only let me ride him."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, nonsense. Pony rides! Ten buckaroos!"
"SpongeBob","  Giddy up, Patrick.  Giddy up."
"Squidward"," Now, I don't mean to nag, so don't bridle me when I say this, but your dream horse is more like a nightmare!  Get it? Night? Mare? Ha-ha!"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah, now you're feeling your oats.  Ha-ha! I'm so good."
"Mr. Krabs","  Four at a time quadruplicates me money. Let's try for five. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh.  Ooh.  Oh!  Ooh. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, next up."
"SpongeBob","  Horsey Patrick, come back! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's me money running away! Come back!"
"Squidward"," Oh, yes. Oh, yes, come back. I said, ""Whoa, horsey Patrick.""  Look at me. I'm a horse.  Clopity, clopity, clopity. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Clopity, clopity, clopity."
"SpongeBob","  Patrick. Patrick...  Patrick.  Patrick! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick?  Hey, it's okay, boy. It's me.  Your old pal, SpongeBob.  Remember?  Okay... Would you like me to whisper?  Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick. Good Patrick.  Calm down, buddy. I don't want to lose you again.  Whoa! Ow! Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me.  Patrick horsey, giddy up!"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Squidward"," Oh, this is humiliating."
"Mr. Krabs"," Quiet.  Horseys don't talk. Okay, kids, ten bucks a ride! Who's next?"
"Squidward"," Ow! Cut it out!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ride's over.  Who's next?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Mr. Krabs. How'd you get Squidward to give rides?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm...  Says right here in his contract.  ""I can work him like a horse."""
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, get your mule away from my show pony! This here's a Thoroughbred. "
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Look at that flank.  Get a load of those locks. Not to mention that loin, eh?"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah. I'm a real stud."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now look at your old pile of dog food. "
"SpongeBob"," I'd put my pile of dog food up against your stud any day!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah? How 'bout a race, then?  First one to delivery a Krabby Patty to Black Devil Bay wins."
"SpongeBob"," You're on! "
"Sandy"," I want a clean race. No cheating! Wait for the bell.  Ah! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha, ha! Eat my dust!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, okay.  Mmm.  Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!"
"Mr. Krabs"," This shortcut sign should send SpongeBob and Patrick far from the finish line.  Hi-ho, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Whoa, shortcut. This could be a trick. I love tricks!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, whoa!  Hyah! Oh, boy, we're ahead!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, you're actually behind! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh...  Huh? Whoa, Patrick. Whoa."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh!  Have some slippery mustard, slowpokes!  That was extra spicy slippery mustard!  Oh, ratfish!  I've got one more trick up me sleeve.  This is the police! I'm pulling you over for speeding!"
"SpongeBob"," Here's your delivery, sir."
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Patrick","  I was hungry."
"Mr. Krabs"," We win! We win!  I—I had the best horsey! I had the best horsey!"
"Patrick","  I don't want to be a horse anymore."
"SpongeBob","  Okay, buddy, but remember, you can still be anything."
"Patrick","  In that case, I think I'll be...  a crab! Ark, ark, ark, ark, ark, ark! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Oh, no, you don't! Come back here with me claws! "
"SpongeBob","  How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy? "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, take a look a this, Gare Bear. Found a slime ball in your shoe? Even purebred snails call fall victim to the scourge of slime balls. "
"SpongeBob"," You really got some air on that one."
"SpongeBob"," I know that meow. That says, ""I'm hungry.""  Lucky for you, I speak fluent snail. "
"SpongeBob"," What, you're not hungry?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, of course.  You wanna go for a walk?  Gary, you really need to work on your pronunciation."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, no walkies. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, if only you could talk like a real person.  Huh? Ooh!  ""The chatterbox translation collar? Know what your best friend is saying!"" A snail translator! That's a great idea, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, time warp, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I wonder where this came from."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, here we go.  Okay, Gary, speak to me."
"SpongeBob","  Papa Bob. Oh! Oh, Gary, now you can express you innermost thoughts in language I can understand.  I have so many questions."
"SpongeBob"," What do you dream about?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, that's sweet."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right?  Let's move on to question two, shall we? What are your long-term goals?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you need to get on that. But what I really want to know is,  how do I look in these pants?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary, you flatterer. Come on, Gare, let's show Patrick your new voice.  Oh, Patrick, I have got a surprise for you!  Say hello to Gary."
"Patrick","  Hello, Gary."
"Patrick"," Hmm? Hmm.  Phew! Ooh, you're right, Gary, I am ripe!  Ah, much better."
"Patrick"," Thank you, my good man."
"Sandy"," Thanks for the old tooth scrubbing! Bye!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar."
"Sandy"," How do you do, little fella? "
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it amazing?"
"Sandy"," Aww, that ain't nothing. I invented a nut translator ages ago. "
"Sandy","  Walnuts are extra nutty."
"Squidward"," Om."
"Squidward"," Center of the universe."
"SpongeBob"," I think your doorbell's broken, Squidward."
"Squidward"," What do you want?"
"SpongeBob"," I thought you might want to chat with your neighbor."
"Squidward"," Why would I want to talk to you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, not to me.  To Gary."
"Squidward"," Oh, good grief. SpongeBob, Gary can't talk. He's a snail!"
"Squidward"," Wha-ha?"
"SpongeBob"," I bought Gary the new pet translator collar."
"Squidward"," Why would you want to talk to him?"
"SpongeBob"," Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?"
"Squidward"," I was talking to Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Turns out Gary has a very sophisticated sense of design."
"Squidward"," Really?  Well, maybe I'll give him a guided tour."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, wait up!"
"Squidward"," And up here, you'll find my true masterworks. Hidden away from the eyes of the undeserving public."
"Squidward"," Huh?  See here."
"Squidward"," Hold on now!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward, I'm taking notes for you. "
"Squidward"," What? What's wrong with it?"
"Squidward","  Oh, gee, do you have to?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't be sad, Squidward, we'll be back soon."
"Squidward","  Oh, I will. "
"SpongeBob","  Night, Gare Bear."
"Squidward"," Good night.  Now, let's see if SpongeBob still wants you to talk after tonight. "
"Squidward","  Stupid rake!  Oh, Papa Bob.  No, no, no.  Oh, Papa Bob.  I'm thirsty."
"SpongeBob","  At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water.  Here you go, buddy, one water. "
"Squidward","  I want to go to the park."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Oh, sure. No problem, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, that was fun. "
"Squidward","  My bed is too lumpy."
"SpongeBob"," All right, then.  Here, Gary, take my bed, hmm? "
"Squidward","  Papa Bob, it's hot in here. "
"Squidward","  Still too stuffy."
"SpongeBob"," Still too—  How's that, Gary?"
"Squidward","  The view is so much nicer a block away."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay."
"SpongeBob"," This should get things rolling. "
"Squidward","  Keep going. Just a little more.  Perfect."
"SpongeBob","  You're right, Gary. The view is nicer over here. Gary?  Gary! "
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!  Oh-whoa-oh! Oh, god! Oh, god! "
"SpongeBob"," Whew! Aww, that was close, huh, Gary?  Oops."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, now where are we gonna sleep? "
"Squidward","  You could always live in a hole, like that idiot sea star."
"SpongeBob"," My house! Oh, Squidward, we're neighbors again. "
"Squidward","  Get off of—"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, I didn't catch that, Squidward, what'd you say?"
"Squidward"," I said, ""Get off of""—"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, looks like Squidward wants a pet of his own to talk to."
"Patrick"," Look, there's those!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh. Are you hungry, little clown? "
"SpongeBob","  Why not?"
"Patrick"," Huh?  SpongeBob, are you mad? Clowns are dangerous animals. Why, at any moment, one of those things could get loose and bite our feet off! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, that little clown wouldn't do that. He was friendly."
"SpongeBob","  I wanna go backstage and see the clowns, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I told you, SpongeBob, our feet are in danger!"
"SpongeBob","  I'll protect you."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," Poor little guy."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, he didn't get any food. Hmm.  Hey, psst!"
"Patrick"," My feet!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't care what that mean old ringmaster says. That clown is hungry, and I'm gonna feed him.  Hey, where'd the circus go? Now I'll never find that little clown."
"SpongeBob","  There you are."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, little clown. The circus left without you! Quick, we gotta get you back to your clown friends.  Oh, you don't want to go back to the circus?"
"SpongeBob"," You don't want to be a circus clown?"
"SpongeBob"," You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you want to work there?  This job should be a snap, little clown. Watch me.  ♪Pick up the hot dog, put it in a bun, add the mustard, relish, now you're having fun♪ "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, you're on."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, is this your cart? Sorry."
"SpongeBob"," I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you."
"SpongeBob"," ""Businessmen wanted.""  Go get 'em, little clown. Oh, I mean, Mr. Little Clown. "
"SpongeBob","  Aww. "
"SpongeBob"," What happened, little clown? Didn't you like that job?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm.  Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe a career in firefighting."
"SpongeBob"," Have a nice fire!  I'll just make sure he gets there safely. "
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not Mrs. Puff's Boating School!"
"SpongeBob"," This is it, little clown. The last job available in Bikini Bottom. "
"SpongeBob"," If you can just stop the clowning for two minutes, you'll have a job. Please! Sorry, little clown. It's been a long day.  Good luck. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Hmm.  Hmm. Aha!  Now get in there, eyes, and stay close to that clown."
"SpongeBob"," No! No, little clown! No! "
"SpongeBob","  No!  Phew! "
"SpongeBob"," Hot pepper pie?!"
"SpongeBob"," Lemon pie?!"
"SpongeBob"," Honey pie?!"
"SpongeBob"," Eye pie!"
"SpongeBob"," Fired?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, little clown, I'm so sorry. I thought you needed a day job, but you're a clown. And a clown needs to run free."
"SpongeBob"," Aww. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww. "
"SpongeBob","  I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts!  Out of the way!  Look out! Where'd you learn to drive, buddy? Oh, Mrs. Puff's Boating School? Me too!  Ahh, the bridge is out! Ahhh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm playing."
"SpongeBob","  Ehh-ehh."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ow! Wow."
"SpongeBob"," Whee! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, these are very nice, but I don't have a driver's license."
"SpongeBob"," Self-driving? "
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Whaaa!  Sold!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh! My very own boat. Ah!  Huh? But there's no key! And no steering wheel!  Where is that—I gotta—  How do you— "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, you talk. How'd you know my name?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, why don't we just go for a drive?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, careful! And stay in your lane! Stop sign! Stop sign! Truck, truck, truck, truck!  Ah!"
"Squidward","  Hmm? Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. "
"Squidward","  Oh, I need to erase this from my mind.  Duh! What's a SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob","  Oh, hi, Mrs. Puff. What do you think of my classy new boat?"
"SpongeBob"," I know! Isn't it great?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, that was the best day of non-driving ever. Coupe, is there anything I can get you? Warm glass of oil? Triple-foam conditioner?"
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Coupe. "
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong, Coupe?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!  Here, take this!  What's up?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww.  There you go, my widdle self-driver. Nice and snuggy-wuggy."
"SpongeBob"," Inside?  All right, Coupe. Come on in."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, you know what'd be fun? If I sat in you and we pretended we were in a drive-in movie."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, so I guess you're just gonna click through the channels looking for a boat commercial all night, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Of course you are.  Well, I'm tired. You can stay up. I'm going to bed.  Oh, Coupe? Good-night. I had a wonderful day."
"SpongeBob"," Ohh!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, what is that? "
"SpongeBob"," I know, Coupe. You're tired. We're all tired."
"SpongeBob"," Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah, well, I didn't want to wake you. You were sleeping like a baby. Heh. Baby buggy!  Baby buggy... "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, how about a ride?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, sure, Patrick. Hop in."
"Patrick"," Yay!  Oh, oh boy! Buttons! "
"SpongeBob","  Uh, Patrick, could you not—  I don't think he—  Don't get your—"
"Patrick","  Butt on buttons!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, I don't think Coupe likes that."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, ice cream. Where's the cone?"
"Patrick"," Oh, don't worry. It's down there somewhere. Ahh. "
"Patrick"," Thanks for the ride!"
"SpongeBob"," Here we are."
"SpongeBob"," Where I work, the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob","  Coupe, open the door! I'll be late!  Yow! But I have to go to work! Ah. "
"SpongeBob"," But I have to go to work. "
"SpongeBob"," I have to go to work."
"SpongeBob","  But I have to go to work!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Ugh. I have to go—"
"SpongeBob"," No, go to the bathroom."
"SpongeBob"," Or I could just go. "
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob","  Eh?  Hmm.  Very funny, Coupe. Very funny."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing.  Hey, wait! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to work. "
"SpongeBob"," Did that hurt?"
"SpongeBob"," Good to know,  because I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts!"
"SpongeBob"," Yahh!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, how are you doing today? Good? "
"SpongeBob"," Well played, Coupe."
"SpongeBob"," Because now we can get to the Krusty Krab the fast way! "
"SpongeBob"," You're right, we're going through the drive-thru!  Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, please.  Squidward, you see me struggling with this boat, and you act like you don't care!"
"Squidward"," It's not an act. "
"SpongeBob","  I hate to do this to you, Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, but I have no choice. "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh! "
"Patrick"," Ah, I thought I smelled ice cream. "
"SpongeBob"," My self-driving days are over."
"SpongeBob"," Eh, I have an idea."
"Patrick"," These self-driving boats are real classy.  It stopped again."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick.  Here's a whole bag of quarters so you can ride forever."
"Patrick"," Ohh! "
