"SpongeBob","  I'm ready!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! "
"Patrick"," No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough!"
"Patrick","  Who's a, uh who's uhh, oh! Who's a big yellow cube with holes?"
"SpongeBob"," I am!"
"Patrick"," Who's ready?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Anchovies! "
"Squidward"," Please, please, quiet!  Is this any way to behave, hmmm?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This is the end! Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Oh Mr. Krabs! "
"Patrick"," Good morning, Krusty Krew!"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!"
"Sandy"," Hold on there, little square dude! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh. Oh yeah? Watch this! "
"Sandy"," I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!"
"SpongeBob"," Me too! I love air! Air is good."
"Sandy"," No kidding?"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I just met this girl! She wears a hat full of... air!"
"Patrick"," Higher!"
"SpongeBob"," Like that?"
"SpongeBob","  Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here."
"Sandy"," Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air."
"Patrick","  When in doubt, pinky out."
"SpongeBob","  I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... "
"Sandy"," Why, these flowers are just beautiful!  They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice, cold water.  So tell me about yourself.  It must be fascinating being a sea critter.  SpongeBob?  Oh, there's the cookies.  Be right back."
"Patrick","  You can't leave now! You'll blow it!"
"SpongeBob","  Air is not good, Patrick! Air is not good!"
"Patrick"," Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. "
"Sandy"," There, that ought to do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda' asked.  I propose a toast, to new friends!  Hold on a second.  I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up! "
"Squidward"," Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh!"
"Patrick"," Hmm, how much is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Only a quarter."
"SpongeBob"," One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.  Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents."
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  Bubbles.  Art. "
"SpongeBob"," No."
"Squidward"," Technique? Hah! SpongeBob, you don't think I created that  beautiful work of art with your help?  Come on, it's in my genes."
"SpongeBob"," I could use a hand here! "
"Sandy"," You okay, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! "
"SpongeBob"," I lost my best friend."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Of course you are. Bye now. "
"Squidward"," Oh sure, right! Whatever.  Like that'll ever happen."
"Patrick","  Yeah, you got it, Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it, Squid! See what you've been missing?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, you got, Squid!"
"Patrick"," It's in the bag!"
"SpongeBob"," This is really your best day ever, isn't it?"
"Patrick"," Here comes Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, great.  Hey Squid! How about that...  ...best day ever?"
"Patrick"," Yup, he's still mad. "
"SpongeBob"," Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose! "
"Plankton"," You'll pay for this, Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," No."
"SpongeBob"," A booster seat? "
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!"
"Plankton"," Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! "
"Plankton"," Don't remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob. This is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? "
"Plankton"," Mmm..."
"Plankton"," Well, this stinks."
"Patrick","  Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!"
"Patrick"," Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, boy, now's my chance! "
"SpongeBob","  Hold on!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years!  Give me an A, buddy!  Squidward is my best friend in the world.  Squidward is my best friend in the sea..."
"Squidward"," Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! "
"Patrick"," Where are ya, ol' buddy?"
"Patrick"," Can I have some now, buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, I need some more! "
"Patrick","  Hey, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!"
"Patrick","  Hey, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!"
"Patrick","  Hey, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Guess what, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," No! Out! "
"Squidward"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary, I'm not walking."
"Patrick","  Get out of bed. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay, now what, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Patrick SquarePants!"
"SpongeBob"," Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about."
"Patrick"," Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. "
"SpongeBob"," How are we going to do that? "
"Patrick","  Got your apple ready?  Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on.  Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. "
"SpongeBob"," Moo."
"Patrick","  Start the boat. "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!"
"SpongeBob"," 1924?"
"SpongeBob"," I think I'm cheating."
"Patrick"," What?! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheating!"
"SpongeBob"," Cheater...! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike."
"SpongeBob"," Well, yeah, but..."
"SpongeBob"," Right, back... it up. "
"SpongeBob","  Backing up! Backing up! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, we can still deliver it on foot. "
"SpongeBob"," Shh, shh, shh. It's working."
"Squidward"," He's stopping! He's stopping! "
"Squidward"," Well, I don't!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! "
"Squidward"," That way? That way there?  So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?"
"Squidward"," Sponge, we gotta eat something."
"Squidward","  You're right. It's for the customer."
"Squidward"," No, I think I saw something.  Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza."
"Squidward","  Oh, looks good, huh?"
"Squidward","  Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!"
"Squidward"," Wait! "
"Squidward"," Will you cut that out?!"
"SpongeBob","  No drink?"
"Squidward"," Yep, it is. "
"Patrick","  Is it time already to ruin Squid's day?  Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!"
"Squidward","  Yeah..."
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!"
"Patrick"," Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving!  La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha!  He leaving, ha ha!  SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Reflecto has found our secret lab."
"Squidward"," He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town."
"SpongeBob"," But you can't retire! There's evil afoot!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, Mermaid Man."
"Patrick"," Hehehehehe."
"Patrick"," Yeah, we did it. "
"Squidward"," Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?"
"Squidward"," Daring today, aren't we?  One Krabby Patty, extra onions. "
"Squidward"," We're all out."
"SpongeBob","  But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on!  Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Why don't you take the rest of the day off?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!"
"Squidward"," Whoop-de-doo."
"SpongeBob"," Hip hip..."
"SpongeBob"," Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya. "
"SpongeBob"," Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," My ice cream! It's alive! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Down here!"
"Patrick"," Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," That's hall monitor to you!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!"
"SpongeBob"," SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report."
"Patrick"," Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark."
"SpongeBob"," Just put on your siren and I'll be right there."
"Patrick"," Uhh, he's just standing there... MENACINGLY!  GET OUT OF THERE, SPONGEBOB!  THAT'S HIS MANIAC SHRIEK! HE'S GOING TO ATTACK!  He's acting all crazy! RUN! HIDE BEHIND THAT BUILDING!  NO, HE'S BEHIND THAT BUILDING! OH, QUICK, HIDE BEHIND THAT STREET SIGN!  NO WAIT! THE MANIAC JUST WENT BEHIND THAT SIGN! QUICK! GET UNDER THE STREET LIGHT!  NO WAIT, AGH, HE'S THERE TOO!

"SpongeBob","  Say again, deputy?"
"SpongeBob"," No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch!  How many fingers am I holding up?  Play dead! "
"SpongeBob"," Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night everybody. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, now, that wasn't nice!  Okay, that is it! Everybody out!  Come on Gary!  Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in.  Huh? They stopped?  Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! "
"SpongeBob","  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?"
"Sandy","  I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. "
"SpongeBob","  Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!"
"Sandy","  But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? "
"SpongeBob"," Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naive? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave those crazy alien notions behind."
"Patrick"," Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something."
"SpongeBob"," A present?"
"Patrick"," Look how big it is, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," It's pretty impressive, all right."
"Patrick"," I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Just don't touch anything. "
"Patrick"," I don't know!  But let's see what this does!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I don't think we should... "
"Sandy","  Oh, SpongeBob... "
"Patrick"," Pardon my French but get this thing off me! "
"SpongeBob"," Nice try, Sandy."

"Mr. Krabs"," Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. "
"SpongeBob"," And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You got a..."

"Mr. Krabs"," This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something."
"SpongeBob"," No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. "
"SpongeBob"," No Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. "
"Patrick"," I miss you!  Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm happy here. This is my home now. "
"Patrick"," I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob! "

"SpongeBob"," Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! "
"Patrick"," No! What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite."
"Squidward"," Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!  I'm almost sorry I'm leaving!  Opposite Day.  SpongeBob, what are you... "
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, everyone says that."
"SpongeBob"," Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery."

"SpongeBob"," I hear you loud and clear. "

"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Sandy"," Your secret workout. What is it? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me."
"Sandy"," Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test."

"SpongeBob"," It was an accident!"
"SpongeBob"," Does that include..."
"Squidward"," Too hot. "
"Squidward"," Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment."
"SpongeBob"," I can't do it! "
"Squidward"," I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?"
"Squidward"," I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!"
"SpongeBob"," I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi Squidward. Does this look deep enough?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?"
"Squidward"," Do it!"

"SpongeBob","  — Messed everything up."
"SpongeBob","  Can I still wear the wig?"
"Squidward"," All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money."
"Squidward"," That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. "

"SpongeBob"," Curses! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and. Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all."
"SpongeBob"," Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!  Ssss!  Took care of her, yes I did.  Oh, ahoy, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. "

"SpongeBob","  Gee Gary, you sure are smart."

"SpongeBob","  You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want."

"Sandy"," I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital."
"Patrick","  Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home."
"Patrick"," This is my mobile home. "
"SpongeBob"," Hiya, Sandy."
"Patrick","  He's mine! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. "
"Sandy","  Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him.  Take me through the plan again."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," There you are.  Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present."
"SpongeBob"," And I have a present for you!"
"Patrick"," Is it ready now?"
"SpongeBob"," Not yet."
"Patrick"," Oh, come on, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm...nope, sorry."
"Patrick","  You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine.  Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival!"
"SpongeBob"," It's not the carnival."
"Patrick"," Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Now take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is."
"Sandy","  You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob...  Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, no problem Fran. "
"Patrick"," They didn't get me anything either!  Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you! "
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!"
"Patrick"," Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything."
"Squidward"," Now what?"
"Squidward"," ...garbage. "
"Squidward"," Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever! "
"Squidward"," Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!"
"SpongeBob"," La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself.  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure you did, Squidward, look. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm..."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, cause this is all I'll need?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Have you finished cleaning the tables?"
"SpongeBob","  I already took care of it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick, you're fired!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Shiver me timbers!"
"SpongeBob","  You are a real pirate. Go straight to the ""X"" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land..."
"Patrick"," Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!"
"Patrick"," I know. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!"
"Patrick"," Yeah..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob","  Look! It's the ""X""."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
"SpongeBob"," We found it together. So we deserve a share!"
"Mr. Krabs"," All for one."
"SpongeBob"," And one for all."
"SpongeBob"," Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...  Patrick, do you have any change?"
"Patrick"," Nope."
"SpongeBob","  Lemme check my other poc-"
"SpongeBob"," This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is...advanced darkness. Hey...  if I close my eyes it doesn't seem so dark."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up Sandy!"
"Sandy"," No, thanks. "
"Sandy"," ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪  ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ "
"Sandy"," Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about...  Texas!"
"Sandy","  I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!"
"SpongeBob"," You'll have to catch us first!  We did it! We got her!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," It's a party!"
"Squidward"," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
"SpongeBob"," Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags."
"Sandy","  I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. "
"Sandy"," What did you just say?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll have one... "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?"
"SpongeBob","  Yeah? "
"SpongeBob"," Anything I want.  Sounds great! "
"SpongeBob"," But I'm a spo..."
"SpongeBob"," That's my ice cream cone!"
"Plankton"," You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?"
"Plankton"," SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, go check in that ditch! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?"
"SpongeBob"," Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? "
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"Plankton"," Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! "
"SpongeBob"," That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month."
"Squidward"," I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but he told us to tell you..."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!"
"Squidward"," Wait, don't go!"
"Squidward","  Where's SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," He's in the house. He's impressed."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go."
"Squidward"," Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... "
"Squidward"," Really? "
"SpongeBob"," But, but..."
"SpongeBob"," Perfect!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I lost me bet!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business..."
"Squidward"," I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one."
"SpongeBob"," Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye.  The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher   until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse..."
"SpongeBob","  Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs."
"Patrick"," Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go."
"SpongeBob"," I can't leave now. I'm working."
"Patrick","  Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!"
"SpongeBob"," All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!"
"Patrick"," Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive."
"Patrick"," Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, no."
"Patrick"," Ready."
"Mr. Krabs"," I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?"
"Squidward"," He took a break."
"SpongeBob"," Gift shop?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. "
"Patrick"," Well, I had my fingers crossed."
"SpongeBob"," You don't have any fingers, Patrick."
"Patrick"," See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun.  Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?"
"SpongeBob"," What am I gonna do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh...lad?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise.  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!  Whew. "
"SpongeBob"," The pants! The underwear! "
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, I'm..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry. There's no danger."
"SpongeBob"," Help... Can't...  open mayonnaise."
"SpongeBob"," Oh..."
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!"
"SpongeBob"," I am?"
"Squidward","  Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Then bring that patty here now!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," It's SpongeBob's fault. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes, yes?"
"SpongeBob"," I forgot how to tie my shoes."
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't wear shoes. "
"SpongeBob"," Could you show me how to tie my shoes?"
"SpongeBob","  I did."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... "
"SpongeBob"," I'm not in the mood, Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Ah... This is the best day of my life."
"SpongeBob"," You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. "
"SpongeBob"," Do you want four quarters?  Or ten dimes?  Or twenty nickels?  Or one hundred pennies?  Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies?  Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are..."
"Squidward"," Oh, what am I doing?  I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. "
"Squidward"," I don't like your tone."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! "
"Squidward","  The truth will be revealed!"
"Patrick","  Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! "
"Squidward"," Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do. "
"SpongeBob","  Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open"". . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! "
"Patrick"," You look at it!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi."
"Patrick"," That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-"
"Patrick","  Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick...?"
"Patrick"," Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief..."
"SpongeBob","  Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!"
"Patrick"," Well, I had some of your sundae."
"SpongeBob"," Sundae...  Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulas!"
"Squidward","  How disappointing."
"Squidward"," No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready! "
"Squidward"," Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. "
"SpongeBob"," I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, too scary. "
"Squidward"," That's it! I quit! "
"SpongeBob"," Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl."
"SpongeBob"," But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato."
"SpongeBob"," Uh... right on."
"SpongeBob","  How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey Squidward! Want to play?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!"
"Mr. Krabs"," One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. "
"SpongeBob"," Sounds great! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!"
"SpongeBob"," Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy."
"Squidward"," Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!"
"SpongeBob"," No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?"
"SpongeBob"," So, what do you say?"
"Squidward"," Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?"
"Squidward"," But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's where you left it."
"Squidward"," It's not there."
"Squidward"," No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. "
"Squidward","  You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it! "
"Squidward"," Please, don't do that."
"Squidward"," Everything's in red."
"Squidward"," Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over."
"Squidward"," Who's there?"
"Squidward"," Are you sure you should be poking it like that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine."
"SpongeBob"," Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, good one."
"SpongeBob"," Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around.  Get back to the kitchen!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. "
"SpongeBob"," Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'."
"SpongeBob"," But sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet."
"SpongeBob"," It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. "
"SpongeBob","  Quiet!  Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves,  nobody gets hurt."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," This whole sack?"
"Sandy"," No, just a cup's worth.  This here's my cricket.  He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?"
"SpongeBob"," Here I come, Wormy! "
"Patrick"," He left his ""Best Friend"" ribbon behind! "
"SpongeBob"," We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there."
"Squidward"," Um, Wormy? "
"Squidward"," I should have known.  Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express."
"SpongeBob"," We tried to warn them. I can't watch. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Gotcha."
"SpongeBob"," Run, everybody, run!"
"Sandy"," Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody?  Oh, hey there Wormy.  You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy.  Howdy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way!  Uhh... You got money, right?"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go, sir."
"SpongeBob","  I have an idea! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't that look appetizing?"
"Squidward"," Mmm, mmm! Good, sir!"
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter?"
"Patrick","  Forget my dumb idea, that's great!"
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick?  Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open!  I'm ready!  I'm ready.  I'm ready...  Patrick, how long have we been standing here?"
"Patrick"," Then I'm going in for you! "
"Patrick"," Come again, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've never had a line."
"SpongeBob","  Here you are, sir. Stay pretty.  All right.  Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs?  The Pretty Patties are a big hit!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!"
"SpongeBob","  Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it!  Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!"
"Squidward"," Yeah, your grandma! "
"SpongeBob"," I am? I mean, of course I am."
"Patrick"," Keep 'em coming, Granny! "
"SpongeBob"," So much for no more baby stuff."
"Patrick"," Oh, Grandma, I'm full. "
"Patrick"," Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!"
"SpongeBob"," Storytime? "
"Patrick","  Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too. "
"SpongeBob"," Yep, that is it. Here I go."
"SpongeBob"," So, uh... that's it. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?"
"Patrick"," Sure did."
"SpongeBob"," We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house!  My turn. "
"SpongeBob"," No problem, Squidward! We're on your side!  Any second now… "
"Patrick"," I hate this channel."
"Squidward"," I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now."
"Squidward","  No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last. "
"Squidward"," 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob! I am finally among my own kind.  Now, goodbye."
"Patrick"," Ying! "
"Patrick"," I guess we've got to order inside. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That looked like Squidward!  That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form! "
"Squidward"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look! It's Squidward!  Squidward! We finally found you! "
"SpongeBob"," Are you Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!"
"SpongeBob","  W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? "
"Sandy"," I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun.  Well hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour!  Isn't this great?"
"SpongeBob"," Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun.  Ok, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!"
"Sandy"," I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park!  This is where the real action is!  This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke.  We're going fly-fishing. "
"SpongeBob"," Not yet."
"Sandy"," Well I'm going to look over here."
"Sandy"," Alpha Team, you search uptown. Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?"
"Sandy"," That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!"
"SpongeBob","  You said it! Sandy'll never find us!  Hey wait, you don't understand!"
"Patrick"," But I don't work here!"
"Patrick"," And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!"
"SpongeBob"," And the candy shop!"
"Patrick"," And with a whale!"
"Patrick"," I'm scared, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," No more nice, warm beds."
"Patrick","  I want ice cream!"
"SpongeBob"," But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean, at least we have each other."
"Patrick"," You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though."
"SpongeBob","  Look what I've got!"
"Patrick"," Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Who?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it."
"SpongeBob"," You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face."
"SpongeBob","  What are you going to do to us?"
"SpongeBob"," Is she a friend from Texas?"
"Sandy","  No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas."
"SpongeBob"," But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you."
"Squidward"," I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts."
"Patrick"," Like a genie. "
"SpongeBob"," Here you go, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Here you go, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," What did you wish for, Patrick?"
"Sandy","  Howdy!  If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb.  That means you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you better run faster, Sandy."
"Patrick"," Did you win?  Hi, SpongeBob!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! "
"Patrick"," Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?"
"SpongeBob"," N-n-n-no. "
"SpongeBob"," The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"
"SpongeBob"," Look at all that warm, toasty fur!"
"Patrick"," Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess I've lived a full life! "
"SpongeBob","  Whahappen?"
"SpongeBob"," That's enough time, I can make up those points! "
"SpongeBob","  Whoo."
"SpongeBob"," What was that, Mrs. Puff? "
"SpongeBob"," Extra credit!"
"SpongeBob"," Got to sharpen my pencil.  N… e… "
"SpongeBob"," Don't look! It's not ready."
"SpongeBob"," It's not ready yet."
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything."
"SpongeBob"," Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!  La La La La!  La La La La! "
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! "
"SpongeBob"," Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even…  Giant clams?!  I'm… not… letting… go… not even for…  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little…  educational television?! Oh, no! "
"SpongeBob"," So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?"
"Patrick","  Touch."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Kevin."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan."
"SpongeBob","  Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin? "
"SpongeBob"," Am I in the Jellyspotters now? "
"SpongeBob"," Now? "
"SpongeBob"," A queen? Can I help?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, where are you going?"
"SpongeBob"," But Kevin, I was your biggest fan!"
"SpongeBob"," King Jellyfish! "
"SpongeBob","  Now what do we do? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, I didn't know this was a hat! "
"Patrick"," Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson.  Hero worship is unhealthy.  C'mon, Jeffrey."
"SpongeBob"," Come boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay. "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?"
"SpongeBob"," Looks like he's frozen or something."
"Patrick"," Well, that's not a question. "
"SpongeBob"," He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! "
"SpongeBob"," Because you're evil!"
"SpongeBob"," Really, really?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17."
"Patrick"," Doesn't look familiar to me."
"Patrick"," Yup."
"Patrick"," It's not my wallet."
"Patrick"," Oops. Gotta start again. "
"Patrick"," No! SpongeBob, tickle him! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good."
"Patrick"," Good, I thought it was my skin."
"SpongeBob"," Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man..."
"Patrick"," Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. "
"SpongeBob"," You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. "
"Patrick"," Uhh... "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?!"
"SpongeBob"," Umm, noxious gas?"
"Sandy"," Uhh, y-yeah... "
"SpongeBob"," La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid."
"Sandy"," Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?"
"Sandy"," Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!"
"SpongeBob"," Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter? "
"Sandy","  You were right SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat."
"Sandy"," Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase! "
"SpongeBob"," Wa..."
"Sandy"," Oh wait, don't tell me. I know this one!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb."
"SpongeBob"," Crabs? Oh brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!"
"SpongeBob"," Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?"
"Sandy"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?"
"Sandy"," Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first."
"SpongeBob"," I thought that meant you were nuts."
"Sandy"," Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land."
"SpongeBob"," Hey!  You did that on purpose!"
"Sandy"," Yeah, but this is an accident! "
"SpongeBob","  I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!"
"Sandy"," Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Sandy","  Thanks for the face lift!  You see, I told you that you didn't-"
"SpongeBob"," I guess I don't, air breather!"
"Sandy"," Water sucker!"
"SpongeBob","  Take that back! You-  not wet person!"
"Sandy"," Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!"
"Squidward"," And drowning, don't forget drowning!"
"Patrick"," Thank you, thank you."
"SpongeBob"," Most importantly...can you do this? "
"Sandy"," Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know!"
"Squidward"," We can't, uh...because..."
"Sandy"," Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!"
"Patrick"," This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air!  Right? I'll try my oyster call."
"SpongeBob"," Uh..."
"SpongeBob"," Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now, who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Gotcha! "
"SpongeBob"," Y-y-yes?"
"Patrick"," Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!"
"Patrick","  Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick"," How about..."
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
"Patrick"," I don't know. Why?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? "
"SpongeBob"," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
"SpongeBob","  That was a closer one! "
"Patrick"," And I got this hat!"
"SpongeBob"," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again."
"SpongeBob"," You're setting us free?"
"Patrick"," Make it five."
"SpongeBob"," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! "
"Squidward"," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!"
"Patrick"," Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's not right because... "
"Patrick"," Uhh..."
"Squidward"," You wished for gum?"
"Patrick"," Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!"
"Patrick"," Hi."
"SpongeBob"," We're home!"
"Plankton"," Ouch. "
"SpongeBob"," Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't lose any money.  I lost..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I bet your contract and I lost. "
"Plankton"," As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob.  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. "
"Plankton"," This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! "
"Plankton"," Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!"
"SpongeBob","  Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way."
"SpongeBob"," Keep going."
"SpongeBob"," Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!"
"SpongeBob"," Faster! Faster! "
"SpongeBob","  No, I don't really feel like it!"
"SpongeBob","  Do ba da ma!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't wanna."
"SpongeBob","  I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby?  I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat! "
"SpongeBob"," three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper? "
"Patrick"," Whatcha drawin'?"
"SpongeBob"," Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!"
"SpongeBob"," Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!"
"Patrick"," Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true."
"SpongeBob","  Coming right up! "
"Patrick"," Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon."
"SpongeBob"," Okay! Why didn't you say so?"
"Squidward","  What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," I'm not going in there "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... "
"SpongeBob"," There he is."
"Patrick"," Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?"
"Patrick"," No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive."
"Patrick"," No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uhh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!"
"SpongeBob"," But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! "
"Patrick"," Eh?!  Who's that?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie. "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. "
"Patrick"," Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me."
"SpongeBob"," No, really, Patrick! Look! "
"Squidward"," Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the "
"Squidward"," The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!"
"Squidward"," I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor. "
"Squidward"," Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor."
"Squidward"," No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.  Horseradish is not an instrument, either.  That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you."
"Patrick","   Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on."
"Squidward"," Wait, wait. I know tensions are high...  There's a deposit on that equipment, people!  Settle down, please!"
"SpongeBob"," Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band."
"Squidward"," I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that...  ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam!  What are you doing here?!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward","  Don't hold back."
"Squidward"," But I thought you liked the night shift."
"Squidward"," You don't remember? It was all over the news."
"Squidward"," The Hash-Slinging Slasher!"
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward","  Except he wasn't a sponge!"
"Squidward"," Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance."
"Squidward"," Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand.."
"Squidward"," Are you sure you want to know?"
"Squidward"," Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke."
"SpongeBob","  Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day."
"SpongeBob"," Hey Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?"
"SpongeBob","  I didn't know the buses ran this late. "
"Squidward"," The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging..."
"SpongeBob"," He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!"
"SpongeBob"," Do you have references?"
"SpongeBob"," It's just a penny, sir.  It doesn't matter."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that...  Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie."
"SpongeBob","  Hey!  that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then what happened to Mr. Puff?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait.  He's trying to tell you something."
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs,  I got the flowers you wanted me to buy."
"Mr. Krabs"," We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I think she..."
"Mr. Krabs","  There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  ""Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!"" And then I'll say, ""But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!"" Then you'll say, ""We're not talking about this...""  ...""Or this""...  ...""we're talking about this!"" "
"Mr. Krabs"," Please lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! "
"SpongeBob"," See?! You just did it again!"
"Patrick"," Need...furniture! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what's with the home improvement?  Hey, Patrick!"
"Patrick","  I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel."
"Patrick"," Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter! "
"SpongeBob"," You're right!"
"Patrick","  That always cheers me up.  But not today."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is."
"Patrick"," Math is power!"
"Patrick"," I'll go get the beverages. "
"Patrick"," He means ""shake"".  No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands!  No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand.  Grab it with only one hand!  Good boy! Now move your arm up and down! "
"Patrick","  Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner? "
"Patrick"," Oh, that's nothing.  You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling ""I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!""  He drives all the neighbors crazy!  Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- . ---was really no help for him.  I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape! I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested,  but never box-chested!  Hey, SpongeBob do you have any mascara I could borrow? "
"Patrick"," Ow! He bit me!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!"
"Patrick"," That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm only pretending to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!"
"Patrick"," Oh, mine too!"
"SpongeBob"," It tingles when I laugh!"
"Patrick","  Pretty  good, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, what was it? What'd he say?"
"Squidward"," Er...he said...um, well he said..."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What   genius puts a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh! "
"Mr. Krabs","  No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!"
"SpongeBob"," Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice ! And he----Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!"
"Squidward"," Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!"
"SpongeBob"," You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven."
"SpongeBob"," I have no talent."
"SpongeBob"," How's this, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," I call it Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time. "
"SpongeBob"," Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors! "
"Squidward"," Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late."
"Squidward"," Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one ""Squidward en repose""."
"Squidward"," Fortune. "
"Squidward"," Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off."
"Squidward"," Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty."
"Squidward"," Really."
"Squidward"," Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again."
"Squidward"," Forget about the book!  Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob.  What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?"
"Squidward"," Right."
"Squidward"," Here you go, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you ""Twelvey.""  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name."
"Mr. Krabs","  Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!"
"SpongeBob"," You okay Mr. K?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time."
"SpongeBob"," But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Then go out there and get me some more jellies!"
"SpongeBob","  Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, that'll never do. More!"
"SpongeBob","  Wrong number.  I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill!  Gary, is that you? Gary?  Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen.  Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly.  Blue jelly!  Hey, old No Name? What's happening?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!"
"SpongeBob","   Something that should've been done a long time ago!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Whew!"
"SpongeBob"," Freedom! Freedom!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm taking jelly off the menu. "
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," You have to be a fry cook."
"Patrick"," Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!"
"Patrick"," Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't even have fingernails."
"Patrick"," Yellow!"
"SpongeBob"," Pink!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!"
"Plankton"," Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick......your carapace!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him! Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean?"
"Patrick"," I'm mean!"
"Plankton"," Now get out there!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And win..."
"SpongeBob"," For the Krusty Krab!!! "
"SpongeBob"," Top that, Pinky."
"Plankton"," Better than you!"
"Plankton"," Don't forget, he called you pink!"
"Mr. Krabs"," ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profits will make me wallet fat!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," And here's yours, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same."
"Squidward"," And you want to keep working here, right?"
"Squidward"," Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.  That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground."
"Squidward"," Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!"
"SpongeBob"," Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!"
"SpongeBob"," Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?"
"SpongeBob"," Like this, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet."
"SpongeBob","  Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!"
"Patrick"," We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else! "
"Mr. Krabs"," There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm! "
"Sandy","  I'll catch your worm for ya, that is, if you're willing to pay! "
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, you don't know!"
"Sandy"," Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you!  Now, what was that idea of yours? "
"Plankton","  Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!"
"Plankton"," Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub? "
"Plankton","  At last!"
"Plankton"," Why- why not?"
"Plankton"," Review?"
"Plankton"," I thought I sent you away, Cretin!"
"Plankton"," What?"
"Plankton"," Uh, sure kid, you're uh... you're on register now."
"SpongeBob"," It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!"
"Plankton","  So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?"
"Plankton","  Hope you like gray. "
"Plankton"," If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy."
"Plankton"," In a cosmic sort of way, yes."
"Plankton"," I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?"
"Plankton","  Take cover from what?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but the worst part is..."
"SpongeBob"," Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, but I will. Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
"Patrick"," I could look at it all day. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, Patrick? "
"Patrick"," Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard. "
"Patrick"," Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies! "
"SpongeBob","  White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?"
"SpongeBob"," Hi. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie."
"Squidward"," There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. "
"SpongeBob"," Wey, wook. It's Widward!"
"Squidward"," Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement. "
"Squidward"," Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose."
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything."
"Squidward"," Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there."
"SpongeBob"," Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?"
"Squidward"," No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!"
"Patrick","  Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?"
"Squidward"," Give me that!  Could I have something to eat?"
"Squidward"," Can't you say anything else but no?"
"Squidward","  Abra."
"Squidward"," All hail the magic conch! "
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you. "
"Squidward","  What the...?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where's my order?"
"Squidward"," In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, you cook the food, the customer gets the food.  We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? "
"Squidward"," Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway."
"Mr. Krabs"," I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come back!"
"Squidward","  You forgot your mayonnaise. "
"Squidward"," Yeah, well, not me."
"SpongeBob","  What? What did you say?"
"SpongeBob","  Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this."
"SpongeBob"," Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... "
"SpongeBob"," But it's good for you!"
"SpongeBob"," A quarter?"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," It's delicious..."
"SpongeBob"," But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms."
"Squidward"," I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with— with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?"
"Squidward"," What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage? "
"SpongeBob"," I always come to work at 3am. This is when I count the sesame seeds.  What are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... "
"SpongeBob"," No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs!"
"SpongeBob","  I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or..."
"SpongeBob","  Hi, I'm SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Can I be excused for the rest of my life? "
"SpongeBob"," Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! "
"Patrick","  Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick? Is that you? "
"Patrick","  No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you there?"
"SpongeBob","  He's still gonna kick my butt! "
"SpongeBob","  Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything."
"Mr. Krabs"," The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. "
"SpongeBob"," More Diet Red Tide? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Somethin' ain't quite right."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air."
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked. What am I gonna do? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okey dokey, SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!"
"SpongeBob"," The dark deed you requested is done, sir."
"SpongeBob","  It's the zombie! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you! "
"SpongeBob"," With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!"
"Squidward","  Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," Yes! But those sound effects the avalanche, the, the, the..."
"Patrick"," Don't forget the second avalanche."
"Squidward","  I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet? "
"Squidward"," I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. "
"SpongeBob"," Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S...  ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?"
"Patrick","  Beep-beep-beep."
"SpongeBob","  Arr."
"Squidward","  Hello, what's this?  ""This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! "
"SpongeBob","  Autograph!"
"SpongeBob","  There you go. Come again, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," Nothing."
"SpongeBob"," Me, uh... either. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!"
"SpongeBob","  Do-o-o-n't!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I can do it! "
"Patrick"," A Squidward action figure!  Let me play with him!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Oh...  And then comes a giant fist! "
"SpongeBob","  Pat, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life."
"Squidward"," N-n-n-n-no. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you."
"Patrick"," You're kidding!  Good thing I still got this pickle! "
"SpongeBob","  This must be the night driving part of the test. "
"SpongeBob"," Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. "
"Patrick"," How are we gonna do that? "
"SpongeBob"," Alright, put the money in the bag!  Put it in!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure.  Here ya go."
"Patrick"," Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom."
"SpongeBob"," Psst!  Hop in, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," No! What are you doing? Help! Help!  No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! "
"Squidward"," Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr! "
"Squidward"," Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?"
"Patrick","  Can I use your bathroom?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Patrick"," Please?"
"Squidward"," No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!"
"Squidward"," No! Wait, why?"
"SpongeBob"," If you're in this war, then where's your fort?"
"Squidward","  Okay, fine! You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now..."
"Patrick"," Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?"
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A perfect fit, eh son?"
"SpongeBob","  All I have is 5."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well-- I don't know... but, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Fresh out."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-uh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag."
"SpongeBob"," Seems a little dangerous. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Now, listen, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Cursed?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh... Smitty something."
"SpongeBob"," He must've been number one."
"Mr. Krabs"," Immediately..."
"SpongeBob"," Right now?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Ahh!  Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  ""Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams."" What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. "
"SpongeBob"," You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, that's a spirit breaker. "
"Squidward","  What a baby."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight."
"Squidward","  Where's that coming from? "
"SpongeBob"," You're right! Wow, he recognized me. "
"Squidward"," Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders? "
"SpongeBob"," They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's see...  ...5, 10, 25, blue, applesauce. Everything looks to be in order...except, , where is it?  Where is it?"
"Squidward"," What?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!"
"Squidward"," You're saying something!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Show me your tentacles."
"Squidward"," What?!"
"Squidward"," I'm out of here!"
"Squidward"," Where have you been?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," A spaceman?"
"SpongeBob"," There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. "
"SpongeBob"," It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, Winner?"
"SpongeBob"," Here you go."
"SpongeBob"," He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. "
"Squidward"," I can't drink that."
"Squidward"," No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work!"
"Squidward"," Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read!"
"SpongeBob"," I've got a better idea!  Why don't I call someone whose job it is to fix it?  You know why? Because when I want a job  done I get someone with a job  to do  that job !"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, I'll be changing alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, are you ready?"
"SpongeBob"," I may be down, but I'm not out! "
"Sandy"," Hi-yah! "
"Sandy"," How tough am I? "
"SpongeBob"," That's impossible! "
"SpongeBob"," So, your name's Reg?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. "
"Patrick"," You tell 'em, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, what're you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Afternoon, Reg."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny."
"Patrick"," Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! "
"SpongeBob"," Weenie Hut General!?"
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?  Boo-boo-bop? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too."
"Mr. Krabs","  What is it, boy?"
"Squidward"," No, wait, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"SpongeBob"," I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. "
"Squidward"," Go get the toaster. "
"SpongeBob","  This is the last robot, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs","  Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Of course, scallops love worms! "
"Patrick"," Do something, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!"
"Patrick"," I know, good thing there's two of us."
"SpongeBob"," You know Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves."
"Patrick","  It sure is cute when it's asleep."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah.  Shh! "
"Patrick"," Well, good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready! "
"Patrick","  Ahh! Wish I could, but I gotta get going."
"SpongeBob"," Going? Where are you going?"
"Patrick"," Phew, what a day."
"SpongeBob"," Oh great, you're home! Now you can help me with the baby."
"Patrick"," Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, ok, tomorrow."
"Patrick"," Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!"
"SpongeBob"," You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything."
"Patrick"," Oh, that's not that much."
"SpongeBob","  Hmmm?"
"Patrick"," No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal!"
"SpongeBob","  Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock."
"Patrick","  Six o'clock."
"SpongeBob"," Six o'clock."
"Patrick"," Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me."
"SpongeBob","  Do you remember what you said to me this morning?"
"Patrick","  I don't need this. "
"SpongeBob"," What? Where do you think you're going?"
"Patrick"," You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes I gotta move the antenna, sometimes I lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, you poor, poor thing! By the way, you forgot your briefcase! "
"Patrick"," You know what that means?"
"SpongeBob"," And that's the kind of work you're doing?"
"Patrick","  There's that stupid noise again!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window."
"SpongeBob"," Junior? Hey, he's flying!"
"Patrick"," This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume."
"SpongeBob"," Despite all we've been through, it was worth it."
"SpongeBob","  Heave-ho! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What stupid barnacle told you that?"
"Squidward"," Uhh… "
"Mr. Krabs","  Secret...?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. "
"Patrick"," Yeah, SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?"
"Patrick"," Good, just don't pay me."
"SpongeBob"," First we need to set up the tarp. "
"Patrick"," And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  Careful, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, the lid's already off."
"Patrick","  Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards."
"SpongeBob","  No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?  Barnacles!  What could be worse than a giant paint bubble!?"
"Patrick","  Nonsense! "
"SpongeBob"," Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?"
"Patrick"," Oh, now I see it!"
"SpongeBob"," This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… "
"Patrick"," Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!"
"SpongeBob","  Nothing's working!"
"Patrick"," I don't see where you're going with this...  hey, a dollar!"
"SpongeBob"," Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!"
"SpongeBob","  We're all done, sir. Everything looks great."
"Patrick","  I don't want to be butt-less!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?"
"Patrick"," We're so sorry!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it."
"SpongeBob"," Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready! "
"Patrick"," Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!"
"Patrick"," The ceiling is right Squidward. You're not a very good employee."
"SpongeBob"," Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? ""Plan Your Own Party Kit""? Hey Lou, how much?"
"SpongeBob"," And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success! This is gonna be the coolest party ever! "
"SpongeBob","  Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests! "
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 903! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. "
"Patrick"," ""Nod politely."" "
"Patrick"," Yeah. Knock, knock."
"SpongeBob"," Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it! "
"Patrick"," You wanna talk to SpongeNob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!"
"Patrick"," Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! "
"Squidward"," Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities!"
"Patrick"," Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! "
"SpongeBob"," O.K. Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead."
"SpongeBob"," Wow... what is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's try next door!"
"SpongeBob"," We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?"
"SpongeBob"," —lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic."
"Patrick"," Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!"
"SpongeBob"," No, wait Patrick!"
"Patrick"," I love you."
"SpongeBob"," I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try."
"Patrick"," We got him now!"
"Patrick","  Nice place you got in here."
"SpongeBob"," I can't understand what were doing wrong."
"Patrick","  Not the way I use them!"
"SpongeBob"," Yet they sell millions of bags a day!"
"Patrick"," The kill!"
"SpongeBob"," If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!"
"Patrick"," You'll walk through walls!"
"SpongeBob","  You'll rule the world!"
"SpongeBob","  No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please..."
"SpongeBob","  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," The boys eyes are bigger than his stomach. "
"SpongeBob","  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," I do!"
"Sandy"," I do!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow! The Mermalair!"
"Squidward"," Krakatoa! "
"SpongeBob"," Holy halibut! It's the chief!"
"Patrick","  Four!"
"Sandy","  Five!"
"Patrick"," I'll save you, Quickster, ahh! "
"Patrick","  Who's the fat kid talking to?"
"SpongeBob"," You, Patrick, she's the teacher!"
"Patrick"," Uh...uh...uh!...24! "
"Patrick"," 24. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob","  I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!"
"Patrick"," I'll deal with you after class!"
"SpongeBob"," It is after class! "
"Patrick"," I hate you more."
"SpongeBob"," I'd hate you no matter what."
"Patrick"," Ohh...  Hmph!"
"Patrick"," Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class! See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie. "
"Squidward"," No. What will you have?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!"
"Squidward"," A very dirty dollar?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, a trip!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay! "
"Mr. Krabs","  You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious!  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip."
"SpongeBob","  Actually, it's Coral Blue number-  three."
"Mr. Krabs","  I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward."
"Squidward"," You're kidding?"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, he'll come. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives...  Why couldn't it have been me?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! What's wrong?"
"SpongeBob","  Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? "
"Squidward"," That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. "
"Squidward"," Patrick, that's a rock."
"Patrick"," Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel."
"Patrick","  A burglar!"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, that's the official."
"Squidward"," Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!"
"Patrick"," Good morning, Krusty Krew! "
"SpongeBob","  Hey Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Not yet."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, you wanna know if I can feel it?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!"
"Mr. Krabs","  That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. "
"SpongeBob"," But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill."
"Mr. Krabs"," You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?"
"Squidward"," What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad."
"SpongeBob"," Because it growled at me. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's not a good sign. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What do you want from me?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?"
"Squidward"," Me too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well."
"Mr. Krabs"," You think I could've gotten more?"
"Squidward"," He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"SpongeBob"," Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing."
"Patrick"," "
"Sandy"," See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain."
"SpongeBob","  Everybody's an idiot except for me."
"Sandy"," Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?"
"SpongeBob"," My what has a what now?"
"Squidward"," Is this where the line starts? "
"SpongeBob"," I won't be alone, so I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin. "
"Sandy"," How are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? "
"SpongeBob"," Listen, I've told you but I'm never leaving my house again. "
"Patrick"," Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?! "
"SpongeBob","  Never ever... "
"Squidward","  No! "
"Patrick"," Aww! "
"Sandy"," Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. "
"Sandy","  Underwater surfing! "
"Sandy"," Patrick, that's not fun. "
"Sandy"," Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal! "
"Squidward"," I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," The money!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!"
"SpongeBob","  Almost closing time, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs"," Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob","  Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know. Be entertaining. "
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!"
"SpongeBob","  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh."
"SpongeBob"," I got 'em right where I want 'em. "
"SpongeBob","  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," What are we gonna do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out there and tell 'em!"
"SpongeBob"," Who do you want?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?"
"SpongeBob"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. Have fun inside!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, it's all crushy-looking."
"Patrick"," Pretty weenie!"
"Squidward"," No! This is relaxing. "
"Squidward"," There's no such thing! They're just a myth."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet."
"Squidward"," You're kidding."
"SpongeBob"," Never wear a sombrero..."
"Patrick"," Ever..."
"SpongeBob"," Ever..."
"SpongeBob"," No. Like that."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once."
"Squidward"," What attracts them?"
"Patrick"," The sound of a sea bear attack."
"SpongeBob"," Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? "
"Squidward"," Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass."
"Squidward"," Hoorah."
"SpongeBob","  I think you'll find everything shipshape."
"Plankton"," All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name."
"Plankton","  Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking."
"Mr. Krabs"," What?! "
"Plankton"," GRASS?!? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton. "
"Plankton"," Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!"
"Plankton"," Eye."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eye."
"Plankton","  ...A cup of love...!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't do it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out of here! "
"Patrick"," You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't remind me."
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! "
"Patrick"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Go!  It's working! I'm flying! "
"SpongeBob"," Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! "
"SpongeBob","  Huh? "
"SpongeBob"," No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!"
"SpongeBob","  Let's roll!  Where to, Mr. K?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure you're up for it, boy?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes?"
"Mr. Krabs"," My garage."
"SpongeBob","  All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  What is it, buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Dennis? "
"Squidward"," Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi... "
"Squidward"," Yeah."
"Squidward"," How's it going, Lieutenant?"
"Squidward"," The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in. "
"SpongeBob"," A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?"
"SpongeBob"," How did you guys know today is my birthday?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!"
"Patrick"," Don't mention what?"
"Patrick"," Lay it on me."
"SpongeBob"," OK, we're invisible, right?"
"Sandy"," I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay back, I'm well-armed!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You'll never get me!"
"Mr. Krabs","  No, spirits, please! "
"SpongeBob","  Pay! "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport."
"Squidward","  What? That is totally unfair!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he's wrong!"
"SpongeBob"," Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming!  Well, I'm not dreaming. "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw, day 3!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order!  I'm counting on you, boy. I need you to raise that spatular.  Yeah! And I need you to say, ""Team Krusty Krab!"""
"SpongeBob","  Did you hear that spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks!  Wow! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, I'm worried that...  Got it?"
"SpongeBob"," That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal  Stay back! I'm warning you!"
"SpongeBob"," No, no! I want to live!  I want to live "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?  Ow!  Hey, look at this! ""Dr. Peter Lankton Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias"". Gosh, I don't know about this, Krabs; wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see...  Well, this looks like the place.  Hello? Doctor?"
"SpongeBob"," Jumping jacks?"
"SpongeBob"," They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! "
"SpongeBob"," Spatula."
"SpongeBob"," Poh-tah-toe."
"SpongeBob"," I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano. "
"SpongeBob"," Where am I? "
"SpongeBob"," In my heart?"
"Plankton","  Wake up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I can safely say, ""No more 24 hour shifts"", because 23 hours will be plenty! "
"SpongeBob","  Easy...  Perfection!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!"
"SpongeBob"," Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo."
"SpongeBob"," How'd you win that?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's ""'Ol Iron Eye"", , and ""Mutton Chop"", , me, , ""Torpedo Belly"", , and ""Lockjaw Jones"". "
"SpongeBob"," You were?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch."
"SpongeBob","  wow, my entire arm disintegrated."
"Mr. Krabs"," No!! "
"SpongeBob","  You're alive! And naked..."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!"
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look Mr. Krabs, I'm you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad."
"SpongeBob"," Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety. "
"Mr. Krabs"," That'll do SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," I won't let you down."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, what have I done?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No!! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. "
"Squidward"," Wow, this time I'm really late again. Maybe he'll finally fire me.  Locked?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Arrgh, me back!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh good, I thought you were hurt."
"SpongeBob"," We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again."
"Patrick"," Yeah."
"SpongeBob"," How many do you think there are?"
"Squidward"," What are you morons doing?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like... "
"SpongeBob"," We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress."
"Mr. Krabs","  So, where's me old mattress then? "
"Squidward"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump."
"Mr. Krabs"," No! "
"Squidward"," My pleasure. Now let's gets a move on. "
"Patrick"," Let's do it again. "
"Squidward"," Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?"
"Squidward"," And my perfect plan falls into place. "
"Patrick","  Uhh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  See if he plays catch."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Happy Halloween, Squidward!"
"Plankton"," Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... "
"SpongeBob"," But what about Mr. Krabs' case?"
"SpongeBob"," A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit."
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't know where he could be."
"SpongeBob","  SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor."
"Mr. Krabs"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Umm...your lawyer didn't give me the combination."
"Plankton"," Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell."
"Mr. Krabs"," Pull yourself together, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. "
"Plankton"," Do you own one?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed superfluous?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you. We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open! "
"Plankton"," Huh? No, no, no!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. "
"Mr. Krabs"," A present? For me?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? "
"SpongeBob"," Darn it. Darn it."
"Patrick"," What is it, buddy? You can tell me."
"SpongeBob"," I took the Dirty Bubble challenge."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," What happened?"
"Patrick"," Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?"
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob","  I can't find Gary."
"Patrick"," I only tasted six types of sediment. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick."
"Patrick","  No, but I'll keep looking."
"SpongeBob","  But there's nowhere left to look."
"Patrick"," What is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's see. ""Dear SpongeBob These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me."" Dear Neptune, what have I done?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, you see..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work."
"SpongeBob"," If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty.  Gentlemen, meet Skill Crane."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. "
"SpongeBob"," Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. "
"Squidward"," Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, there's a secret? "
"Squidward"," Yeah! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! The secret?! "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, do you wanna win or not? "
"SpongeBob"," Close your eyes.  Now be the crane.  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. "
"Squidward"," I am a winner, aren't I?  Winner, winner, winner!  Wiiiiiinner!  I'm a winner, everybody! You hear that?!  I'm... a winner. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for."
"Patrick"," Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!"
"SpongeBob","  Monster! "
"Squidward"," The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? "
"Patrick"," Maybe. "
"SpongeBob"," It's a secret. "
"Patrick"," Our new president is a genius!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah. "
"Patrick"," Okie dokie. "
"SpongeBob"," Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly! C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot!"
"Patrick"," It is a lovely day for a ride in the country."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call Patrick.  OK…Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?"
"Patrick"," Danger!?"
"SpongeBob"," As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger."
"Patrick"," I say he checks out a-ok!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?"
"Squidward","  No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors!  And stop calling me president!"
"Squidward"," That oughta do it! Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now!"
"Squidward","  GRRR, you infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!"
"Patrick"," Wow! Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood!"
"SpongeBob"," We gotta turn this thing off!  Nope, not it."
"Squidward","  This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. "
"Squidward","  Get out of my house! Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm retiring!"
"SpongeBob"," I sure am!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O' Mondays? Not the name I would've chosen. But that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute. I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, really?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Find some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted. "
"Squidward"," Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O' Mondays."
"Squidward"," Sincere service with a smile."
"Squidward"," More like another nickel."
"Squidward","  Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, a little."
"SpongeBob"," My laugh box?"
"Patrick"," Sure, Sandy."
"SpongeBob","  Sure, I'd love a good laugh."
"Sandy"," What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here."
"Patrick"," Hey, what the... "
"SpongeBob"," Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!"
"SpongeBob"," I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh! "
"Patrick"," Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. "
"Squidward"," Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop."
"Squidward"," Yeah.  You really fell for it."
"Squidward","  Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel.  yahhhh!  and falls flat to the ground, while two paramedics come take him to the hospital]"
"Patrick"," Look, he's waking up."
"Sandy"," You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box."
"Squidward"," Cut it out?!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity. Salutations fellow knights."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century? Don't you see, Patrick? We really are in medieval times!"
"SpongeBob"," Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them. Isn't that right, Squidly?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," We just wanted to buy some armor."
"SpongeBob"," That's perfect! "
"Patrick"," Try telling that to Squidly. "
"Plankton"," C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique. "
"Plankton"," Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?"
"Plankton","  Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!"
"Plankton"," Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket."
"Plankton"," Boyfriend?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But, mommy..."
"Plankton"," Eugene."
"Mr. Krabs"," I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to."
"Plankton"," Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time stay away from me mother. "
"SpongeBob"," Mermaid Man is timeless!"
"SpongeBob"," But they are! And they're using...  actors."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! ""Adventures in the Underground City""."
"SpongeBob"," Great, Pat, what happens?"
"Patrick"," And they have an adventure..."
"SpongeBob","  Adventure..."
"Patrick"," Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee."
"SpongeBob","  Good one, Pat. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here."
"SpongeBob"," Sure, Mr Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie."
"SpongeBob"," Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair."
"SpongeBob"," Not makeup department, you're the makeup artist."
"SpongeBob","  They're beautiful.  They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Ok...action!"
"Sandy"," I love my new job."
"SpongeBob"," That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator."
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo! "
"Sandy"," Hold on tight."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy."
"Squidward"," It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same."
"Sandy"," I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you two doing laying around? Get to work."
"Squidward"," If you say so. "
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, cap'n."
"SpongeBob"," Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  Can't... reach the buns."
"Mr. Krabs"," Time is money, boy."
"SpongeBob"," Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar."
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, hi."
"Mr. Krabs","  There you go, Squiddy."
"Squidward"," They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it  sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating."
"Sandy"," One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. "
"SpongeBob"," So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in."
"SpongeBob"," Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward"," Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro."
"Squidward"," Why don't you ask SpongeBob?"
"Patrick"," Good idea, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," How may I serve you, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help."
"Squidward"," What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Squidward! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!"
"Squidward"," Not anymore. I quit. "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't have to rent you a room!"
"Squidward"," I've got cash."
"Mr. Krabs"," And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken."
"Squidward"," The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, how did your mother make 'em?"
"Squidward"," How should I know?! Ask my mother! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk..."
"Mr. Krabs"," So you're all taken care of?"
"Squidward"," Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward"," Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming."
"Mr. Krabs"," You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!"
"Squidward"," No, I'm good."
"Squidward"," Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob","  I got Mrs. Puff fired. "
"SpongeBob"," Ready for my test, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew! "
"SpongeBob","  That'll be easy."
"SpongeBob"," Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm ""unteachable""."
"Patrick"," Wow."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!"
"Patrick"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob","  Onward... to Squidward's house."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?"
"Sandy"," It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?"
"SpongeBob"," So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine."
"Sandy"," Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure."
"Patrick"," Right."
"SpongeBob"," So let's start inventing!"
"Patrick"," Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark."
"SpongeBob"," Light bulb, already invented. "
"Patrick"," Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are."
"Patrick"," As sure as I'm a doctor professor."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't you think we should test it?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?! "
"SpongeBob"," The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," It's OK, Gary. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks."
"SpongeBob"," You just gotta scare someone other than me."
"SpongeBob","  Hey, champ! How's it... "
"Squidward"," Mother?"
"SpongeBob"," And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors--bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast."
"Mr. Krabs"," While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy."
"SpongeBob"," I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor."
"Squidward"," Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty."
"Mr. Krabs"," All their songs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And frosting."
"Mr. Krabs","  I ought to..."
"SpongeBob"," You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob"," Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here. "
"SpongeBob","  A videotape?  ""You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants"". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo! "
"Sandy"," Howdy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe your karate  the best, but now they've recognized a new number one."
"Sandy"," There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up."
"SpongeBob"," Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived."
"SpongeBob","  Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself."
"Sandy"," Hold on, buddy! "
"Sandy"," Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome."
"SpongeBob"," Don't do it, Sandy! "
"Sandy","  I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!"
"SpongeBob"," I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?"
"Sandy"," You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... "
"SpongeBob","  Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, we better get back to work."
"SpongeBob","  WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming Spat!"
"SpongeBob","  Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! "
"SpongeBob"," Anything you want and more. "
"Mr. Krabs","  What? Are you going against your commanding officer?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... "
"SpongeBob","  One Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it?  Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one...  I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole!  Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you!  Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big."
"SpongeBob","  Always the kidder, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?"
"SpongeBob"," ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true."
"SpongeBob"," Can we come out now?"
"Patrick"," Is that good?"
"SpongeBob"," Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done."
"Squidward"," Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better."
"SpongeBob"," We were just gonna play some party games."
"Squidward"," I gotta get out of here. "
"Patrick"," Ho, ho, ho!"
"Squidward"," No, like this! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money. "
"Squidward"," Free. I'm free!"
"Mr. Krabs"," So how much money did you make last night?"
"SpongeBob"," We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!"
"SpongeBob"," Is that proof enough for ya?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no! "
"Plankton"," Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?"
"Plankton"," Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?"
"Plankton"," Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary's not misbehaved!"
"SpongeBob"," Affirmatory."
"SpongeBob"," Yup, yup, yup."
"Squidward"," Rash?"
"Patrick"," Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?"
"Patrick","  That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie."
"SpongeBob","  Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction."
"Mr. Krabs"," But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?"
"SpongeBob"," That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten."
"SpongeBob"," Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's... for his own good, SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. "
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here."
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob."
"Squidward","  I need 20 Krabby Patties, please."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is."
"SpongeBob","  Yippee! I happily acquiesce."
"Patrick"," I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!"
"Patrick"," Then what is it?"
"SpongeBob"," It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig."
"SpongeBob"," Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you."
"SpongeBob"," Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs."
"Squidward"," Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. "
"Squidward"," It's about as functional as your brain."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Sandy. What do you think?"
"Sandy"," We need to talk. "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig."
"SpongeBob"," I wish I had a wig. "
"SpongeBob"," Ocean wave.  Tropical breeze."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, you've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it."
"SpongeBob","  There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy."
"Sandy","  Hmm.  Just as I thought.  You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was  clumsy of you."
"Sandy"," That's right, Squidward. Let me show you.  This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.  I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size..  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!"
"Squidward"," Are you sure this is safe?"
"SpongeBob"," Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut- hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!"
"Patrick"," Wow! I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside."
"SpongeBob"," Can't. I'm guarding it."
"Patrick"," Hmm.  ""Shrink."" I do have a lot of issues."
"Sandy"," I'm back, SpongeBob.  Uh-oh."
"Sandy"," Hi, Squidward.  Well, the submarine is safely inside you."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and..."
"Patrick"," She's in there?  I'll save you, Sandy!"
"Squidward","  I heard that!"
"SpongeBob"," Um...we broke it."
"Sandy"," Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?"
"Squidward"," So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!"
"Sandy"," Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous."
"Squidward"," What's happening? "
"Sandy"," They're hitting your central nervous system!"
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions."
"SpongeBob"," Ew! Where are we?   Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming!"
"Sandy"," The stomach acid levels are way too high!"
"Patrick"," We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow."
"Sandy"," He's right."
"Patrick"," What plan?"
"Squidward"," Morons."
"Patrick","  Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave.  Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral.  YOW!  Goodbye seaweed."
"SpongeBob"," Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume.  Hmmm..."
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat..."
"SpongeBob"," ...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia! "
"SpongeBob"," C'mon, Patricia. "
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia."
"Mr. Krabs"," We do? Great, she can start right away. "
"Squidward"," He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?"
"Squidward"," Umm, I think I need to take a shower."
"Squidward"," It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. "
"Patrick"," Do it again. Do it again."
"SpongeBob"," Ok. "
"SpongeBob"," Good evening, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point? "
"Patrick"," Could you turn it up?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?"
"Patrick"," Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward?"
"Squidward","  That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV. "
"Patrick"," Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny."
"SpongeBob"," Smelly. "
"SpongeBob"," Popcorn is served! "
"SpongeBob","  Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1..."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?"
"Patrick"," Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone."
"SpongeBob"," 57 times."
"Patrick"," Who's a winner?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm a winner."
"Patrick"," Ready. "
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Mom!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy."
"Patrick"," How's that?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Patrick","  I know exactly who you are! "
"SpongeBob"," Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gar-Gar."
"Patrick"," I have to get rid of these books! "
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this ""alleged"" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. "
"Patrick"," What is?"
"SpongeBob"," That you're king!"
"Patrick"," King needs food badly."
"Patrick","  Tasty."
"Patrick"," Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it."
"Patrick","  I love being king."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker."
"Squidward"," Ferris Wheel?"
"Squidward","  What?"
"Patrick"," And what..."
"SpongeBob","  Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk."
"Patrick"," Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?"
"SpongeBob","  La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The ""Ild Ones""! That's a strange name.  Scallop!!  Bye ""Ild Ones."" I like your silly name. Hmm...""w."" Oh, oh, they're not the ""Ild Ones."" They must be the ""Wild Ones."""
"SpongeBob"," There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you going on about? Bikers?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, this is serious! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Patrick"," Hello, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick"," Hello, SpongeBob. Bloodthirsty bikers! We got to hide! "
"Patrick","  See?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's your salivation."
"Patrick"," I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See Squidward? We walk the walk but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?"
"SpongeBob"," What about our coalition?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again."
"SpongeBob"," Then can we save the town?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good."
"Mr. Krabs"," Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule No outside drinks. No exceptions! "
"Squidward"," That's telling them."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me see that. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret?  Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!"
"Plankton"," Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job!  Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formula."
"Plankton"," They're everywhere."
"Mr. Krabs","  We've got to do something about this.  You sure this is going to work?"
"Plankton"," Let's beat it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No kidding. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Buy one? "
"Plankton"," Good luck."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks.  I can't believe we did it."
"Plankton"," You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff."
"Mr. Krabs","  No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine."
"Plankton"," Really? Let me try that.  Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm.  Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad.  This is amazing."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about.  KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake."
"Plankton"," Look at us!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now what are we going to do?"
"Plankton"," It's good to be home."
"Mr. Krabs"," You said it."
"SpongeBob"," You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!"
"Patrick"," I'm all done."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should spread out a little. "
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. "
"Patrick"," A present? What is it?"
"SpongeBob","  It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to."
"Patrick"," I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!"
"SpongeBob"," Where are you going?"
"SpongeBob"," Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?"
"Squidward"," Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. "
"Squidward"," How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. "
"Squidward"," What are you doing, SpongeBob?"
"Squidward","  Hello, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Woo-hoo-hoo! "
"SpongeBob"," How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you."
"Squidward"," Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty?  See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. "
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?"
"Squidward"," Fine then. Do my work for me. "
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Mini Squid!"
"Squidward"," What the...? That's my joke!"
"Squidward"," Oh boy! Back to work!"
"Squidward"," That was awful! "
"SpongeBob","  Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Get out of the way, boy!  Me building's been condemned, boy. We got ourselves a nematode infestation. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's!  Wait till Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah!  Hyah! "
"Sandy","  SpongeBob, what on earth are you doing?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah?"
"Sandy"," Hang on. I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel! "
"Patrick"," For me? "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... "
"SpongeBob","  Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!"
"SpongeBob"," Now get in there and give me a concert to remember. "
"SpongeBob"," But..."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm not paying for that!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪It's the best day ever♪"
"Patrick"," Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go.  Good-bye, stink ball. See ya never. "
"Patrick"," Well, how do you explain this? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up.  Isn't this a cute look?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?"
"Patrick"," What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?"
"SpongeBob"," Now, Patrick, I can explain."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh."
"SpongeBob"," Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmmm, something ain't right.  For me?"
"Squidward"," Don't you find this a tad suspicious?"
"Plankton"," Happy Birthday Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ....fashion me clothes from rags."
"Mr. Krabs"," Moneyyyyyyyyyy?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. "
"Plankton"," Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Give me that!"
"Plankton"," Oh, either one will do."
"Mr. Krabs"," What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did."
"Plankton"," Why don't you tell them the truth?"
"Plankton"," Gimme that! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop, you're gonna bust it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Plab Patties KO's Old Man J"". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy."
"Plankton"," You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it."
"Mr. Krabs"," No way, that recipe's mine! "
"Plankton"," I think not, Rag Boy."
"Mr. Krabs"," What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little..."
"Squidward"," Hurry up, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm adding the love!"
"Squidward"," Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir."
"SpongeBob"," Why, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob","  Me?"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook."
"Squidward"," No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off."
"SpongeBob","  ""And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!""  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Whoa! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that? "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, it's working... "
"SpongeBob"," The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... "
"Squidward"," Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?"
"Patrick"," Quick! Turn it on, SpongeBob!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights! "
"SpongeBob","  I'm waiting. I'm waiting."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?"
"SpongeBob"," We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy."
"SpongeBob"," Yup.  Isn't there anything else?"
"Patrick"," Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone? "
"SpongeBob"," Not now, I'm busy.  Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!?  So tired.  So hungry.  But... must wait... for toy."
"Patrick"," Yeah, see?  Here's a present and your cake."
"SpongeBob"," My birthday cake."
"Patrick"," Actually, you've only been here 20 minutes."
"SpongeBob"," I've been mean to Gary and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me cause... I'm a big jerk! "
"Patrick"," Could you come back later? He's having a moment."
"SpongeBob","  ...in waiting for... my toy!  Whoo!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I waited so long..."
"Patrick","  For a sec, I..."
"SpongeBob","  You! You ruined my free toy!"
"Squidward"," There. Now see?  It's supposed to do that."
"SpongeBob"," Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!"
"Patrick"," Hi, SpongeBob! Eww! "
"SpongeBob"," Is something wrong, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!"
"SpongeBob"," Good idea! "
"Patrick"," This."
"SpongeBob","  Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," All what-y?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," It's not me, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton just bought some baby clothes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah? Yeah?"
"SpongeBob"," We're right behind him, and he has no idea! "
"Patrick"," Self destruct!!  There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone."
"Mr. Krabs"," You found out what Plankton's up to?"
"SpongeBob"," You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton","  Do your worst, Krabs!"
"Patrick"," Abandon ship! "
"Plankton","  I win! I always win! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton","  You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try."
"SpongeBob","  You're me! Then I must be... "
"SpongeBob"," That. "
"Squidward"," Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow."
"SpongeBob"," Right back at you, Lenny!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Thaddeus!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him. It's-- something."
"Squidward"," Uh, it's just that I was going to—enter your name in our sweepstakes!  So, what should I put down?"
"Squidward"," It's on the house. "
"Squidward"," Oh, you'll see it, Just keep looking."
"Squidward"," But-but-but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong."
"Mr. Krabs"," The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict."
"Squidward"," Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win.  I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize."
"Squidward"," You mean, no vacation?"
"SpongeBob"," See you on the outside in ten years, buddy. "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?"
"SpongeBob"," All night, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son."
"SpongeBob"," Already done, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh. Hi, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection.  So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar."
"Squidward"," Ah! Eww.  Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... "
"Squidward"," NOOOOOOOOOO!!! "
"SpongeBob"," You're welcome, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs"," Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!"
"Squidward"," That's totally selfish!"
"Squidward"," Huh? "
"Squidward"," As long as you turn the heat up."
"Plankton","  I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quit your lollygagging and get a move on. "
"Squidward"," Order up."
"Mr. Krabs"," This is fantastic. The local hockey team is paying me to practice here."
"Patrick","  Hi, SpongeBob. "
"Plankton"," I did it. I finally got a Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," You're mine now, Plankton!  You won't get away with this, Plankton."
"SpongeBob","  The clamboni! "
"SpongeBob","  I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! "
"Patrick"," Oh, look, the bus is here! "
"SpongeBob"," Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come."
"SpongeBob"," No tickets. I must have left it at home."
"Patrick"," Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck."
"SpongeBob"," There it is. The line looks awfully long."
"Patrick"," Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick."
"Patrick"," I'm hungry, too. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do."
"SpongeBob"," This is it, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," We're not crybabies."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride."
"Patrick"," Yeah! "
"SpongeBob"," Aw. well, we can help you. right, Patrick?"
"Plankton"," Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz."
"Plankton"," Well, hop to it, lads."
"Squidward","  Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe."
"Plankton"," Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!"
"Plankton","  Secret formula, here I come. "
"Plankton"," I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula."
"SpongeBob"," And how. Come on, fellows. let's do some interior decorating."
"Plankton","  Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while. "
"Plankton"," ...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors.   "
"Mr. Krabs"," And the computer? "
"Squidward"," Oh, that's Plankton's wife."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I need that order of six."
"Squidward"," Right here, muscleboy."
"SpongeBob","  I won't let you do this to Patty."
"SpongeBob","  Enjoy, sir."
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, how about another game of—  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out."
"Sandy"," Hi-yah!  Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?"
"Patrick"," I've been replaced by a sandwich!  Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. "

"Squidward"," How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind. "
"SpongeBob"," There she is."
"Mr. Krabs"," Your date's a Krabby Patty? Methinks the boy's really lost it."
"Squidward","  What's that putrid odor?"
"SpongeBob"," This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the ""manager's treatment,"" do you?"

"Mr. Krabs"," I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean.

"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"SpongeBob"," We come here every morning."
"Squidward"," And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party."
"Squidward"," It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in. "
"Patrick"," Let's do it again."
"SpongeBob"," Let's do it again."
"Squidward"," No! You're going out this door, right now-- "
"Squidward"," Can I come?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," A smiley face with dimples? "

"Squidward"," Now what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know."
"Squidward"," You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?"
"SpongeBob"," All aboard."
"Patrick","  No, no!  Yay! "
"Patrick"," Sponge-- "
"SpongeBob"," Ew, what's this?"
"Patrick"," I never thought about anything!"
"SpongeBob","  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired."
"Patrick","  It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? "
"Patrick","  Ohh, dodgeballs."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain."
"SpongeBob"," That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. "
"Patrick"," My song. Ahh... "
"SpongeBob"," Come on, let's hear it!"

"Sandy"," 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition."
"SpongeBob"," Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please help me! "
"Sandy","  I need this!"

"Squidward"," Oh! What is that?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Shredded...  gold?  Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry but I've got to go. "
"Mr. Krabs"," No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. "
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!"

"Mr. Krabs"," What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else.  Ah hold still, Squidward."
"Squidward"," You're standing on my neck!"
"Patrick"," Where'd SpongeBob go?"
"Squidward"," Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing!  What's going on here? I... Oh no. "
"SpongeBob"," Quite."

"Patrick"," Huh?! SpongeBob, get out of my taco!  What's the matter, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells! "

"SpongeBob"," Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. Blackjack.  Cousin Blackjack's out of prison!?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary."

"SpongeBob"," That's right. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking.

"SpongeBob","  But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!"
"SpongeBob"," I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?"
"Patrick"," Noooo! You're not my best friend!"
"SpongeBob"," We gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals! "
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah? Well  I got your eyeballs! "
"SpongeBob","  Eww, brain juice!"
"Patrick"," I'll fix it. "
"SpongeBob"," Satisfied?"
"Patrick"," No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail Polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!"
"SpongeBob"," You, sir, could use some dental hygiene! "
"Patrick"," No! No, not...not deodorant! "
"Patrick"," Oh, I'm not going to eat it. "
"SpongeBob"," No, not Patty socks!"
"Patrick"," Hoppin'...  ..Claaams!  Hey, I got my filth back!"
"SpongeBob"," Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you! "
"Patrick","  My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm covered in muck and scum!"
"Patrick"," Smear slime on my teeth?"
"SpongeBob"," And dry-clean my uvula!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends..."
"Mr. Krabs"," He's already 10 seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this."
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry! I'm sorry! "
"Patrick"," Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. I'm gonna go back and make a 2nd b-day cake that my mom will like. Idiot Boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. "
"SpongeBob"," Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise."
"Sandy"," Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got!  Get out of here! Idiot Boy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you OK?"
"Mr. Krabs","  If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy! "
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, is it?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You do?"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. There's SpongeBob. "
"Sandy"," CheeseHead BrownPants?"
"Sandy"," Surprised I found you?"
"Patrick"," You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you? "
"Sandy"," You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back."
"Squidward"," Don't just stand there, get in."
"Sandy"," Here it is! You must recognize this place."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties."
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg."
"Squidward"," Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  STOOOOOP! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand-  Hey, I remember this place."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob's back!"
"SpongeBob","  Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever."
"Squidward","  excuse me for just a second."
"SpongeBob","  She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!"
"SpongeBob"," No, please. Just... just don't."
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. "
"SpongeBob"," Wait!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob?"
"Squidward"," What did she call me?"
"Squidward"," I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger. "
"SpongeBob"," Just remember Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you."
"SpongeBob"," I know Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just need... "
"SpongeBob"," You're back! Oh, Squidward...I love you no matter how many times we smash your face."
"SpongeBob"," Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?"
"SpongeBob"," Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad.  She can't close us down."
"Squidward"," How long has he been standing over there?"
"Mr. Krabs"," There ya are, Betsy! Good as new! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yeah..."
"Plankton"," Krabby Patty?! "
"Patrick"," That's it!  Come right in!"
"Patrick","  What's the pas-  Nope, that's not it!"
"SpongeBob"," Does that mean you're not sending us to the Slammer?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance!"
"SpongeBob"," I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you!  Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley."
"Patrick"," Good-bye! Not a word!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes sir."
"SpongeBob"," I said I'm ready Stanley.  Whoa! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," About what I said..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, good. Because there are plenty of other relatives that got passed over for the job!"
"SpongeBob","  No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right!"
"Squidward"," Oh.  Hello. Hello.  Hellooo!"
"Squidward"," Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?"
"SpongeBob"," I was spying on you."
"SpongeBob"," No, not really... He traded me these 2 chocolate bars for it."
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. "
"Squidward"," Oh no! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Nyah-Nyah-Nyah♪"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Plankton.  Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!"
"Squidward"," Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Plankton, what's that?"
"Plankton","  Yes, perfect, now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?"
"Plankton"," Nope "
"Plankton"," When nobody's there? "
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Got a, uh, what? "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, I just need to get the key out. "
"Squidward"," We're gonna be stars!"
"Plankton"," Uh… I'm ready?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't think so. Ooh wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there too."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Find anything special lately?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great! Well, share it with me!"
"SpongeBob"," The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," What can I do you for?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But did you check all your pockets?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, no."
"Mr. Krabs"," Shirt pockets? "
"SpongeBob","  Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, maybe it fell in your sock."
"SpongeBob"," Hey look, it's my brain!  Hey where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," So, uhh, no penny, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... "
"Squidward"," Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night."
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty!"
"SpongeBob"," ""...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end.""  Time for a little shuteye before...  Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow?  Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow!  Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! "
"SpongeBob"," No problemo, Mrs. P. }"
"SpongeBob","  With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws,  it'll get your spices where they need to go."
"SpongeBob","  I knew it!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," STOP!!! I know what to do.  I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches.  Next, lower anchor.  Oh no!  The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back.  Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy! At long last!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call."
"SpongeBob"," I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life."
"Plankton","  Get ready Krabs,  for the surprise of your life!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Brace yourself!  Huh?  Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition.  What is that? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,"
"Plankton"," Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin! "
"Plankton"," This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2!  Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?"
"SpongeBob"," What do we do now Patrick?"
"Mr. Krabs"," But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars."
"SpongeBob"," You've really made him happy."
"Patrick"," I think, I broke my bottom."
"SpongeBob","  Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa! "
"Patrick"," Exactly."
"Squidward","  Stop!  What could you possibly be trying to do this time?"
"Squidward"," Yes, really! Maybe you should start being a little more normal!  Doh..."
"SpongeBob"," Yup."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, see ya 'round. "
"SpongeBob","  Hi, how are ya."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, see ya 'round."
"Squidward"," There you are, sir.  Oh, yes it's time again. I've been meaning to say this but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. "
"SpongeBob"," What you call dull I call normal."
"Patrick"," Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze? "
"SpongeBob"," Let's do something normal, like window shopping."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal."
"SpongeBob"," One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. "
"Patrick"," Huh, I don't think you have what it takes."
"SpongeBob"," Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again."
"Patrick","  Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy! "
"Squidward"," Wonderful weather we're having, hm?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine Squidward! You don't wanna be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? """" No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I cant replace everyone! I'll never be happy again!  Ooh, my driver's license!  That's the baby.  Hi, fella, it's me.  It's okay, i'm licensed.  Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la-  -la-la-la...  Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  NOOOOOOOOO!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry, I'm late Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. "
"SpongeBob","  Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," It was National No SpongeBob Day."
"SpongeBob"," A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," Know what?"
"SpongeBob","  This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there  so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip  and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead but then I wasn't but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," I know, it hurts so bad."
"SpongeBob"," H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!"
"SpongeBob"," But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine!  I'm fine! I'm OK! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See?  See? See?"
"SpongeBob"," Wew."
"Squidward","  Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick."
"Squidward"," I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade! "
"Squidward","  I gotta get out of here!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes my friend. You got... the goods!"
"Squidward"," Watch this! "
"Squidward"," Let's give them a grand finale they'll never forget!"
"SpongeBob"," Up ahead!!!"
"SpongeBob"," This is how to live, isn't it my friend?"
"Patrick"," Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, where you going?"
"SpongeBob"," I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of ""living in the moment"" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? "
"Patrick"," Are you sure about this SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?"
"SpongeBob"," 3-2-1 Lift off. "
"SpongeBob"," What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more.  What would Larry do?"
"SpongeBob"," It seems to be stuck."
"Patrick"," We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today."
"SpongeBob"," In fact,  it's time for another coat. "
"Patrick"," Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes."
"SpongeBob"," No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working.  Okay Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Can't talk, working."
"SpongeBob"," No, really Patrick, what are you...  Uh, I fell sticky."
"Patrick"," What?"
"SpongeBob"," Can I get a little help here?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing? "
"Squidward","  Patrick?"
"Squidward"," Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?"
"Patrick","  Yeah."
"Patrick"," Here you go SpongeBob."
"Squidward","  What did you do?"
"SpongeBob"," There, now you have plenty of space. "
"Squidward"," Oh, tell me about it. "
"SpongeBob","  There he is."
"Patrick"," Oh, I got one! You know that thing?"
"SpongeBob"," Um, right, that thing that we did that day."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm, how to fix his nose?"
"Patrick"," Try it again."
"SpongeBob"," I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head."
"Squidward","  I look horrible! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, get back here!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. "
"SpongeBob"," Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. "
"SpongeBob"," Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face."
"Patrick"," Okay! Let's see. Hmm "
"Mr. Krabs"," What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers! "
"Squidward"," Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone!"
"Patrick"," I heard that! "
"SpongeBob"," You wanted to see me, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Sit, down!  Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy."
"SpongeBob","  No!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's time!  Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"Plankton"," What are we eating this time, Karen?"
"Plankton"," Is this a joke?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food. You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob"," Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oath. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later."
"Plankton"," That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my Chum!"
"Mr. Krabs"," D'oh, just put me out of me misery! "
"Plankton"," Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?"
"Plankton"," Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace."
"Squidward"," It's hot chocolate. "
"Squidward"," Oh, why can't I just find?"
"Squidward"," Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it."
"Squidward","  Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!"
"Squidward"," Um, excuse me, there don't seem to be any empty seats left."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I am here because I."
"Squidward"," Why I'm.  All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!"
"Squidward"," Mm, bon appetite, Squidy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!"
"SpongeBob"," Before what?"
"SpongeBob"," Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs"," WHAT? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25¢ PER WORD! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea! "
"SpongeBob"," Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles.  Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Thanks for your business, and here's your paper. "
"SpongeBob"," That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else.  Now get out there, and fetch another story! "
"Plankton","  ""Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?""  What?!?  Who's to blame for this? Who?!? "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!"
"SpongeBob","  Aye-aye, sir. "
"Sandy","  Sorry, fellars, this is a private treedome."
"Mr. Krabs"," No! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, okay, I'm going. "
"Mr. Krabs","  This is mutiny!"
"SpongeBob"," You wanna stay here? At my house? With me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Maybe I should just sleep under the highway. "
"SpongeBob"," No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Turn it off! Turn it off, I can’t take it!"
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies."
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They’re probably destroying me house right now! Like this!  Oops! I don’t care! It’s not mine!  Oh, look! One of the home owner’s most prized possessions!  La-di-da!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Then get into Pearl’s party and find out what they’re doing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What’s taking SpongeBob so long? I’m getting tired of looking through his stuff. "
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, it’s working! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You get into that party, or you’re fired!"
"SpongeBob"," It’s me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeesh, I only asked for one."
"SpongeBob"," I only need eight! "
"SpongeBob"," Let’s boogie! Whoo! "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob, that doesn’t cheer me up at all."
"SpongeBob"," Gary? Ohhhh! Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward.  Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary, there you are. What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity.  Hi, Squidward.  Ready! Hi again, Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by that guy!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy!  Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present. "
"SpongeBob"," That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells."
"SpongeBob"," Boy these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose.  Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I won't let it happen again."
"SpongeBob"," It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that."
"SpongeBob"," I was wearing shoes. They... It's so hot they melted off."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Could you be a little more specific?"
"Squidward"," They're at the beach."
"Sandy"," -eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-haw! I love the beach!"
"Squidward"," Who are you?"
"Patrick"," I'd love to!"
"Patrick"," Almost up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm.  Dark sky.  Water spouts.... of blood.  Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley. "
"SpongeBob","  Cool!"
"Squidward"," You've never even seen him!"
"Patrick"," Plus, we wanna talk to you."
"SpongeBob"," Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home? "
"Patrick"," Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake."
"Mr. Krabs"," Locust. Culinary! Oh.  Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? "
"Squidward","  Oh, wonderful."
"SpongeBob"," He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed."
"SpongeBob"," Where's he going?! Come on! "
"Patrick"," Hey, that's what they used to call me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth."
"Mr. Krabs","  No!! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, all alone again.  Cashy!"
"Patrick"," No!!"
"Squidward"," Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! "
"Patrick"," So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it."
"SpongeBob","  So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really..."
"Patrick"," Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home, eating a box of Kelp Jerky."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?"
"Patrick"," No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesn’t work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before.  Like this! Ready, clam?"
"Patrick"," That's not a baby, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Well, then, what could it be?"
"SpongeBob"," Good idea coming here, Patrick."
"Patrick"," Good idea!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's my specialty."
"SpongeBob"," Hello."
"Patrick"," Well, just don’t take too long. We were just about to start playing with it."
"Patrick"," What do you mean, ‘small fortune?’"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," So, did you figure out what you’re gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?"
"SpongeBob"," Yup…I mean, nope."
"Patrick"," You do?"
"SpongeBob"," The mall!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?"
"Patrick"," Well, I don’t think so. Normally, I…"
"Patrick"," Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob? SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," That’s my name, don’t wear it out."
"Mr. Krabs"," We don’t want any trouble, now just keep moving."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," About what?"
"SpongeBob"," The money, and about those people being my friends."
"Patrick"," Yup, I found it!"
"SpongeBob"," Found it? Where?"
"Squidward"," ♪Fi-ga-ro!♪ "
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Where are you going, all dressed up?"
"SpongeBob"," A fancy party?"
"SpongeBob"," All except for that last one."
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Huh?!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm good enough to join the Men's Chorus. I promise!"
"SpongeBob"," What a lucky break!"
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, I will be late to practice with all of your tomfoolery slowing me down!  It is a high honor to be chosen for the Bikini Bottom men's chorus, and you are not going to keep me from performing my Grand Solo!"
"Squidward"," Gentlemen."
"Mr. Krabs","  Don't we all?"
"SpongeBob"," And together we are..."
"Patrick"," Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"SpongeBob"," Actually, we're here to fake wrestle."
"Patrick"," What was that?"
"SpongeBob","  That's Wrestlese for ""You're dead meat."""
"SpongeBob"," Fake wrestling."
"Mr. Krabs"," Actually...  It doesn't!  Okay, okay, look. Just...  Hey, where'd they...  Oh, no! Not the..."
"Patrick"," Squeeze."
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Curtain Number 2?"
"SpongeBob"," The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey."
"SpongeBob"," Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!"
"Patrick"," No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three..."
"SpongeBob"," One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please."
"SpongeBob"," How much is it? For this one?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob, what's wrong?"
"SpongeBob","  Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!"
"SpongeBob","  Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!"
"Patrick"," Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards?  I locked myself out of my house again. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh?  Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs...  it's beautifu-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago."
"SpongeBob"," And?"
"Squidward"," Ay! What do you want?"
"Squidward"," a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born."
"Squidward","  Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?"
"Squidward","  Well, then why don't you go ASK THEM?!"
"SpongeBob","  Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff.  If you would take the time to  answer all my neat questions,  then that would be  really swell."
"SpongeBob"," Huzzah!"
"Squidward"," Would you mind telling us what this is all about?"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! I still have lots more questions about the Vikings' way of life."
"SpongeBob"," Anything else?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula."
"Squidward","  It's all yours."
"Patrick"," Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always works for Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," And tarnish my reputation of never missing one day of school? No, I couldn't. Besides, that would be lying. And lying is wrong."
"Patrick"," Oh! There's always the catch.  I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, is this really neces—"
"Patrick","  Uh-huh.  Why?"
"SpongeBob"," Nothing. Nothing.  That's it!"
"SpongeBob"," The bathroom key!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, that was fun. Well, I should really start heading back to class."
"Patrick"," Pretty cool, huh? "
"SpongeBob"," How'd you do that?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you know how to play this game?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I'm getting pretty good at this game!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  Well, I better be off now."
"SpongeBob"," Miss, if you don't let me go right now, I might have to turn into a criminal!  Whaaa!"
"SpongeBob","  Ohh! I never returned Mrs. Puff's bathroom key! I can't give up now!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin bla, bla, bla!"
"SpongeBob"," Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, ""Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"""
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, nothing. Look! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Sounds like we got a prize.  Ready, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!"
"Squidward"," Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!"
"Squidward"," Hello, Brother Roger."
"SpongeBob"," Do we get to join the lodge?"
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?"
"Squidward"," "
"Patrick"," Found Squidward. "
"Squidward","  You can look now."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!"
"Patrick"," Dog-pile on Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Morons."
"SpongeBob"," Not the way we do it."
"SpongeBob","  Let's move. "
"Patrick"," Initiation."
"Patrick"," After you, Brother SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob","  Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow!  Brother Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?"
"Patrick"," Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan."
"Patrick"," Roooo!"
"SpongeBob"," Roar!"
"Squidward"," Unbelievable."
"Squidward"," Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends."
"SpongeBob","  Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood.   Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there.  So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward? ."
"Patrick"," Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed. "
"SpongeBob"," He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my ""dirty little hovel""."
"SpongeBob"," Oh-okay, Squidward. "
"Squidward"," Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?"
"Squidward"," Yeah, probably not.  I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes. "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can... "
"SpongeBob"," Hot hors d'oeuvres? "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, of course.  Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum.  Please make yourself at home!  Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit."
"SpongeBob"," So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?' "
"Squidward","  He copied all 492 of my self-portraits...  ...and they're better than mine!  He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything.  This...all of this is just...  Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...  posthaste!  A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home...  Home... with me... with me... "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? You okay? Squidward?  Squidward! "
"Patrick"," A pretty long time. Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Patrick.  Gary?  They've shrunk!  I'm gonna need to get new pants. "
"Patrick"," SpongeBob?  No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me."
"Sandy"," Well, howdy, stranger! I don't recognize you in those newfangled dungarees.  You must be SpongeBob FancyPants. Clothes really do make the man!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward! Guess who?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right.  Oh no, it's locked.  Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants. "
"Patrick"," Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us.  I wish I could see him one last time. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again.  Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq...  Sorry, I'm a little...  I'm a little...  I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... Roundpants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment.  Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh!  Here are the applications.  Let's see here. ""Name.""  SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well.  Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers!  Question two. ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" Hmm, what's a felony?"
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"Squidward","  Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill. "
"Squidward"," Um... fine."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants."
"SpongeBob"," I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who told you that?"
"SpongeBob"," Order up, Squidward."
"Sandy"," Well if it isn't SpongeBob UnderPants. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure thing. "
"SpongeBob","  I've got it! "
"Patrick"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Because, we're card carrying members of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fan club."
"SpongeBob"," Got it!"
"SpongeBob"," Well maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty! Mr. Jail Warden!"
"SpongeBob"," Uuhhhhhh! That's the evil Man Ray!"
"Patrick"," You too missy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, our work is done here."
"Patrick","  And then some."
"SpongeBob","  And then some!  That's a good one!"
"Squidward"," Why?"
"Squidward"," It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, look! It's Squid... "
"Patrick"," I'll say."
"Squidward"," Alright, that's enough!"
"Squidward","  Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time."
"Squidward"," You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!"
"Patrick"," Okay SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay Patrick! Here I come! "
"Patrick"," Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball."
"SpongeBob"," Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!"
"Patrick"," That sounds delightful! "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up  Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob? Don't you know that it's 700 in the morning?"
"SpongeBob"," Enjoy your new home, little guy."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad."
"Plankton","  There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise.   Delectable!"
"Plankton","  Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab which is located directly across the street!"
"Plankton"," Oh come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!"
"Plankton"," Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!"
"Plankton"," They're supposed to do that.  Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement."
"Plankton"," All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket."
"Plankton"," Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay boy, get out there. "
"SpongeBob"," Uhhhhh, uuh uuh."
"Plankton"," Hey, what gives?"
"Squidward"," Krabs is gone?"
"Squidward"," No."
"Squidward"," This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before."
"SpongeBob"," Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties. "
"SpongeBob"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," I know your secret..."
"Squidward"," Moron."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what're you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!"
"SpongeBob"," There's another secret? What's the secret?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh...  How's this, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Got it!  Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?"
"Squidward"," If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!"
"SpongeBob","  The telescope!"
"Sandy"," Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What happened to your clothes, boy?"
"SpongeBob"," Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this? "
"Sandy"," That looks like my power drill! You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister! "
"Patrick"," We could've worked something out."
"SpongeBob"," Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once."
"Sandy"," Nonsense, SpongeBob! Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000!  First, I close the protochamber...  ...And finally... she presses a button, and there is a glowing light from the chamber, everyone gasps as 2 SpongeBobs emerge from the tube]"
"SpongeBob"," What are you doing out here, silly?"
"Patrick"," Ugh! I hate that hat!  Fine, have it your way, hat!  Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!"
"Patrick"," Standin' around out here all day."
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"Patrick"," Do I get my hat now?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs"," It's OK, boy, he signed a waiver.  Is he ready, Mr Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Ready!"
"Patrick"," I dunno, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. OK, I'll do it! "
"Patrick"," Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you belong, aaaah! ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Thank you."
"Patrick"," You're giving me a raise."
"Patrick"," Really?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, pal."
"Patrick","  Yeah, that'll happen."
"SpongeBob"," Ugh, there is just nothing to play with."
"Squidward"," Get out!"
"Patrick"," We hadn't thought of that one."
"Patrick","  Almost there!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, we're here."
"Patrick"," We wanted to go to the toy store, but it's not open yet."
"SpongeBob"," ♪Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah!♪ Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," What part of ""never"" don't you understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, we have to leave."
"Patrick"," Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?"
"SpongeBob"," No. But I do now. What do we do first?!"
"Patrick"," That was fun! Now let's dress up like fairy princesses! ."
"SpongeBob"," Ready, Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, don't!"
"SpongeBob"," My eyes!!"
"Patrick"," No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today. "
"SpongeBob"," That's shin dig buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship."
"SpongeBob"," I'm going to the beach with my best friend!!!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!"
"Patrick"," I knew it! We've been abandoned!"
"SpongeBob"," No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here! "
"Patrick"," Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?"
"SpongeBob"," Perfect! Now run along, Patrick and I'll  toss it to you!"
"Patrick"," I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice. "
"Patrick"," Yes, I can!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I can!"
"SpongeBob","  I guess I go better take a look. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary?  Noooooooooo! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, your right, too gaudy.  No, too last season.  Well, I need that. A-haha, look Gary.  Here, try this on for size."
"SpongeBob"," Here it is Gary. Your neeew shell. . You look ready to ride.  Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gair, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off hey, buddy? "
"SpongeBob"," Well it... certainly is shiny."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, wait, wait! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first,  shoes are tied, hands are de-ry  and now a thick layer of bubble wrap "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh. I see "
"SpongeBob"," Deal!  Oh, another bad dream.  Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob me boy, I need to borrow a blanket."
"SpongeBob","  I guess ""All's shell that ends shell. Huh, Gary?  Gary? Gary?  Gary?!"
"Plankton"," Hello sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?"
"Patrick"," Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!"
"SpongeBob","  Five. "
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?"
"Mr. Krabs","  A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land.  There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly.  Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Plankton"," Excuse me, would you like a free sample?"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, uh  I'm full thanks!"
"Plankton"," I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing.  What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week Patrick? "
"Patrick"," OOH I like that one!"
"Plankton","  HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!"
"Plankton"," Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine."
"Patrick","  Huh?!"
"Plankton"," NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like ""Chum is Fum"" but different."
"Plankton","  Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick my boy, you really earned that promotion!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yep.  Keep up the good work boy'o!"
"Plankton"," Stop that at once! You—!"
"Plankton"," "
"SpongeBob","  Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like..."
"Plankton"," Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything."
"Plankton"," My loove?"
"Plankton"," L..."
"Plankton"," Llll...uhhh...vuh!"
"SpongeBob","  Trampling enemies...  Now tell me about Karen."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh! a music lover, I think we have our solution you need to serenade her."
"Plankton"," Ready? But what do I sing?"
"Plankton"," No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it."
"Plankton"," You really liked it?"
"SpongeBob"," They're such a lovely couple.  The Krabby Patty Formula?!"
"SpongeBob","  How do ya turn this thing off?!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! I'm Saved! Your wife exploded!   Um... Happy Anniversary you guys. "
"Plankton"," E-M-I-L-P? What's E-M-I-L-P?!"
"Squidward","  What the?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Fore!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Then shut your porthole."
"Squidward"," Battening down the word hatches, sir."
"SpongeBob"," There we go."
"Mr. Krabs"," Decorations, check. Security?"
"Mr. Krabs"," So, let's get out there and sell some Krabby Patties!"
"Mr. Krabs"," The door!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Everybody, calm down. I spent a lifetime working in this restaurant, and I know there's only one way out of here."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days."
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs,  Why do you have cameras watching us?"
"SpongeBob"," Thank you Mr. Krabs. Dental hygiene is very, very important."
"SpongeBob"," Follow me!"
"SpongeBob"," You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you."
"Plankton"," Yes? Go on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, what's with the creepy smile?"
"Squidward"," I was just  remembering the world before SpongeBob."
"Sandy"," And how!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes."
"Squidward"," Yes."
"Patrick"," And I'll just write my... myself down here for... forgiving up, too. Uh, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, I don't want to give up."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ow!"
"Patrick"," What now?"
"SpongeBob"," And let's not forget the man who made it all possible. Mr. Krabs. What could be better?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, 'tis a beautiful sight. It warms me heart.  Me Krabby Patty recipe! What's it  doin' out here? Whoa-ho! Shoulda known! Plankton."
"Plankton"," You know, this isn't so bad. Everyone looks like little ants from up here. Wait. Help."
"Mr. Krabs"," Stay away from the high-tension wires.  Allow me to open the door for a valued customer."
"SpongeBob"," Happy anniversary, Krusty Krab."
"Patrick"," No. Just kidding!"
"SpongeBob"," I see you even brought your double net."
"Patrick"," Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go."
"SpongeBob"," Good idea."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up."
"Patrick"," You can say that again."
"SpongeBob"," Actually, I can't."
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," No! I— what storm?"
"SpongeBob"," That's better."
"Squidward"," This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first."
"Patrick"," He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Patrick"," Darn it!"
"SpongeBob"," Tie."
"Squidward"," Grrr!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over."
"SpongeBob"," Please..."
"SpongeBob"," I have a question."
"Squidward"," Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food. "
"Squidward"," Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry."
"Squidward"," But all I wanted was something to eat."
"Patrick"," Did somebody say something to eat?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look out!"
"SpongeBob"," Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, wait!"
"Mr. Krabs"," And good riddance! Next time, you should read our sign about the mandatory side of fries policy!  Lookie, another flat-eyed, bushy-tailed customer!"
"Plankton"," Did you see that?"
"Plankton"," Well, let's just dig deeper and go around it!"
"Plankton"," It's just a shame no one else can see it!"
"SpongeBob"," It's a ""stalagmiter,"" available exclusively at the Chum Caverns Gift Shop."
"Plankton"," Another order of Chumballs!  Huh?"
"Plankton"," Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak. Not well, I'd imagine. Now hold still so I can bury you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Not if I bury you first! "
"Plankton"," Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me! My diminutive stature allows me to slip through rubble with ease. "
"Plankton"," I am, and I will!"
"Mr. Krabs"," But what about our deal?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Capturing customers! I should've thought of it sooner! But without Squidward, I need someone to work the register. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast."
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir."
"SpongeBob","  No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined."
"SpongeBob"," Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities."
"SpongeBob","  Another one!  Plus some rope. "
"SpongeBob"," For King Neptune's birthday!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, thanks, but..."
"SpongeBob"," Don't go."
"Mr. Krabs"," Great idea, go and play them another song."
"Mr. Krabs","  What he say?"
"Squidward"," I think he wants us to look at the O MY!"
"SpongeBob"," What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?"
"Patrick"," Right"
"SpongeBob"," We better use the secret entrance."
"Mr. Krabs"," Please! I'll be ruined!"
"Patrick"," You thinking what I'm thinking?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them."
"SpongeBob"," Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us"
"Patrick"," Ahh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Yes Patrick?"
"SpongeBob"," Say again, Squidward? "
"Squidward"," I know I'm on TV! See the camera?  You're on TV too! "
"Squidward"," This isn't happening!"
"Patrick"," I'm not on TV!  SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! You gotta try this! "
"Squidward"," That means you take all the pretty pictures. "
"Patrick"," All right!"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh ooh! Whoo! Whoo! Let me do something too, please?!"
"SpongeBob"," It's heavy!  Thanks! But it itches. "
"Sandy"," Whee, doggy! I can line-dance better than that!  Yee-haw!"
"Patrick","  My shorts are wet! "
"Squidward"," That's funny. Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance. "
"SpongeBob","  Well, that's very nice of you to say. "
"Squidward"," You got a dance audition? "
"Squidward","  Hmm...  "
"Squidward","  By the time that idiot gets back, he'll be too tired to dance! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm back from Mount Oyster!  Here.  Got this for you at the gift shop  "
"Squidward"," All right! You wanna learn some dancing?! I'll show you dancing!  You know what gets people going? Ribbons!  "
"SpongeBob"," Well, yes, but-- "
"SpongeBob"," Right, Squidward.  And a-one, and a-two, and a--  Nope.  "
"SpongeBob","  And a-one, and a-two, and a-oof!  Is that okay, Squidward? "
"Squidward","  Observe a true master at work.  "
"Mr. Krabs"," refrigerator."
"Mr. Krabs","  Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat."
"Mr. Krabs"," No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?"
"Mr. Krabs","  G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect."
"Squidward"," Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas."
"Mr. Krabs"," Because if you do, I'll fire ya.  No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?"
"Squidward"," Hello, police?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?"
"SpongeBob"," Pearl? What happened?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks, pal. "
"SpongeBob","  Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone! "
"Patrick"," Look! The ball toss!"
"Patrick"," Ohh! Ohh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know... I have too much eye pain."
"Patrick"," Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too!  Check it out!"
"SpongeBob"," That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy."
"Patrick"," Who asked you?!  Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?"
"SpongeBob","  My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!"
"Patrick","  This is all my fault!  Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!"
"Sandy"," Whew! Boy, that's ripe."
"Sandy"," Mm-mmm! Nothing like a hot shower to make a squirrel feel like a new woman!"
"Plankton"," Sandy Cheeks? But where's her fur?"
"Sandy","  I'm locked in!"
"Plankton","  Please don't put your finger on it."
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh, the gooey freshness that is the Krabby Patty patty."
"SpongeBob"," But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty. First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees."
"Plankton"," An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?"
"Sandy"," Chipmunk?! What is so funny about havin' my fur stole?"
"SpongeBob"," Now that we're grillin', we can work on the fixin's! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed."
"Plankton","  Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, still off by that much. Try it again.  Ooh, try again  Mmm, try again.  Oh, try again.  Oh, try again."
"Plankton","   Arrrgghh! You try it again! I'm makin' my move!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr Krabs! Sandy's makin' off with the formula!"
"Sandy"," Gotcha! And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself."
"Plankton"," My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, thank you Sandy. Thank you Sandy."
"Plankton"," Eh, that's the life."
"Plankton"," You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here."
"Plankton"," Yes."
"Plankton"," Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!"
"Plankton"," Ugh. great."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!"
"Plankton","  It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?"
"Plankton"," Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!"
"Plankton"," That's it! I'm going somewhere else.  Where are those ear drums? "
"Mr. Krabs"," The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-"
"Plankton","  Ow! I hate my life!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?"
"SpongeBob"," Okay!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, uh, scratching!"
"Patrick"," Oh, well. Never mind. "
"Squidward","  And would you have kelp fries with that?"
"Plankton"," Coming dear."
"Mr. Krabs"," Somethin' is terribly wrong, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," And it's taken you this long to figure that out?"
"Plankton","  Next Chumstomer, please.  Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!"
"Plankton"," Wha?"
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, do you think it might be kinda... unhealthy to be feeding people all this grease?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Questions are a danger to you...  and a burden to others. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Quadruple goodness?!  We'll see about that.  Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour. "
"Squidward"," P.U, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?"
"SpongeBob"," They're feeding people grease."
"Plankton"," Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm,  this was all his idea! All of it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, it's not the end, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh what difference does it make?"
"SpongeBob"," No it wasn't, Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly. The Krusty Krab is grease free!  Patrick No! "
"Squidward","  No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. "
"Squidward","  I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!"
"Patrick"," Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again."
"SpongeBob","  What happened to yours?"
"Patrick","  Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!"
"SpongeBob","  I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else."
"Patrick"," Why don't you find out?"
"SpongeBob","  Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. "
"SpongeBob","  Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?  ♪ Laaa! ♪  Sorry. "
"SpongeBob"," I guess a sponge can make it in this town.  I am going to be a star! "
"Patrick"," All right!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep."
"Mr. Krabs","  Afternoon, boy-o!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. "
"Squidward","  Can things get any worse?"
"Squidward"," What? No!"
"SpongeBob"," Please let me help!"
"SpongeBob"," Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?"
"SpongeBob"," Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Thank you Squidward."
"SpongeBob"," No peeking."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward that... that's a beautiful thing to say!"
"Squidward","  How?"
"Squidward"," Neptune no!"
"Squidward"," Really?!  Garbage. I'm made of garbage"
"SpongeBob"," Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru...  Sorry sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside."
"SpongeBob","  They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye. "
"SpongeBob"," Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happen to your matters? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here you.  There you are, Fluffy. Now eat up I'm gonna go make my enchiladas."
"SpongeBob"," I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night."
"SpongeBob","  Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along!  Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. WHOA!!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right Gary, you have let me no choice! "
"Patrick","  Oh yah! Yah! Yah! I want that!"
"Patrick"," Hey!  Where's the toy?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it doesn't come with a toy."
"Mr. Krabs","  What's the problem here?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys."
"SpongeBob","  My purpose in life is to have you as my toy. ."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, good looking."
"Patrick"," It came from the meal that we're ""sharing."""
"SpongeBob"," Sharing?"
"Patrick"," Aren't you supposed to be working? "
"SpongeBob","  Of course."
"SpongeBob"," Gary, you can be a real negative nancy! "
"Patrick"," I can't go out! I just washed my hair!"
"SpongeBob"," You don't have any h- come out Patrick! It's my turn!!"
"Patrick"," You sure?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm sure!  Hi, Patrick! Time to share!"
"Patrick"," Well, gotta go! "
"SpongeBob"," Hold on, buster! Hand over the toy! It's my turn!"
"SpongeBob"," Water?!"
"Patrick"," Communication is key."
"SpongeBob"," It's my turn!"
"SpongeBob"," It's our Krabby Patty toy Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so that I couldn't play with it."
"Patrick"," Nuh-uh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh you, toy eater!"
"Patrick"," This time, it's on me. "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, that's my money."
"Squidward"," Please."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob!  Report to me office."
"SpongeBob"," Good luck, Mr. Krabs- "
"Mr. Krabs"," You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate  He wants a tip."
"Mr. Krabs"," Go ahead! Give it a try!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure. "
"Patrick","  Yyyeeeeeep!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts."
"Patrick"," And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts!  Ooohhhh!"
"SpongeBob"," We're going to haunt you! Foreeever!  Oooooohhh—!  Well, that killed the mood. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!"
"SpongeBob","  La la la la!  I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What?"
"Squidward"," This! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eewww! Gross!  Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives!"
"Squidward"," It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah... Sizzle those juices."
"Mr. Krabs"," It's me old navy locker. Good as new! "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh! Do we share our lockers like we share hairnets?"
"Squidward"," Order up, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," I didn't! I wore protective gloves! And besides, don't you like how classy it look now?"
"Squidward"," What is that idiot doing now?! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's simple"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, Wait!"
"Squidward"," uuhh.. I'm.. trying to find my clarinet."
"Squidward"," I'm sorry I-I-I didn't mean to offend you."
"Squidward"," ha ha! Wha the- SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!"
"Patrick"," I win! I win!"
"Patrick"," I gotta get outta here!"
"Squidward","  -Such a nightmare!"
"Squidward"," Grrr..."
"SpongeBob"," Hmm.. I was just going to bring his clarinet."
"Patrick","  It says, ""Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."""
"SpongeBob","  Superhighway!!!!!???? Do you know what this means??!!"
"SpongeBob"," Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!"
"SpongeBob"," We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid."
"Plankton"," Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle."
"SpongeBob"," Why?"
"Plankton"," Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and-"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm scared!"
"Patrick"," Oh, . He said, ""Let not your heart walk away from you, lest your mind grow legs and follow it."""
"SpongeBob","  Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened after he was arrested?"
"Patrick","  It's a wig!"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for the lift!"
"Patrick","  I am!"
"SpongeBob"," If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!"
"Patrick","  Look!"
"SpongeBob","  Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  Is that all you got? "
"Squidward","  Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles.  It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene. "
"Plankton"," Oh sure!  Let me just wind my watch!"
"Mr. Krabs","  What for?"
"SpongeBob"," Look! All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!"
"Mr. Krabs","  You know something, Plankton? Maybe we can talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life."
"SpongeBob"," Well okay, I guess, sorry I am a little nervous."
"SpongeBob"," All right everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to Bikini Bottom since those 99 cent stores."
"Plankton"," Good effort, SpongeFool, but you can't destroy my highway, it's indestructable!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy Squirrel! "
"Patrick"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae! "
"SpongeBob","  You yelled at me! YOU YELLED AT ME! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore."
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy! Is it 730 already?"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm still at work."
"Patrick"," Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is."
"SpongeBob"," Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?"
"SpongeBob"," I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset."
"SpongeBob","  Aww. He looks like an angel."
"SpongeBob","  Mother, father?"
"Squidward"," Fine!"
"SpongeBob","  You said something, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Walking..."
"SpongeBob","  More popcorn, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Mrs. Puff? "
"SpongeBob","  Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! I get to show you the ropes Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now."
"SpongeBob"," Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember Good Grades."
"Mr. Krabs"," Just don't let it happen again, Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll never talk."
"SpongeBob","  Smells like blubber to me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap."
"Plankton"," There's a whale in the laboratory!"
"Plankton"," Karen! Karen--!"
"Plankton","  Hey! Get me out of here! "
"Plankton","  What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 415 bus should be here any time now."
"Plankton","  Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!"
"Plankton"," Really?"
"Plankton"," No, no. Thank you! "
"Mr. Krabs"," This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!"
"Plankton"," The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?"
"Plankton"," Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this great Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down here for a sec. [falls asleep with the two owners. Gary sees the two other snails on the swing feeling bored then he sees one snail about to climb up the ladder where the slide is next to and falls down bored, and Gary sees the seasaw where a little snail named 'Mary' is on. Gary's eyes turn into hearts and slithers to the other side of the seasaw. Mary sees Gary who is falling in love with her."
"SpongeBob"," And how may I help you on this fine day?"
"Squidward"," WHOOPEE! Ha ha ha! Whoopee! Woo-"
"Squidward"," Let's see here. Ahem. Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Of course."
"SpongeBob"," Well, if they eat and watch a play, you can charge twice as much!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...OK. But only on one condition that you both keep workin'. Because if just one Krabby Patty is late, I'm shuttin' you down!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I love it!"
"Squidward"," Wow! Look at all these aspiring actors wanting to take part in my genius!"
"SpongeBob"," Did I get the part?"
"Squidward"," Raise the curtain!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What did I tell you? You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!"
"Squidward"," Fine."
"Squidward"," It would appear not. No ketchup! That's terrible! Here, let me help you with that."
"SpongeBob"," Huh? Um, ahem, ah...I...uh...I forgot my lines!"
"SpongeBob","  Oh, the trash is full. I had better call...the garbage truck."
"Squidward"," His genius was unrecognized."
"SpongeBob"," What have I done? Have I let the lure of theatre production get between me and my patties?"
"Squidward"," Here! Enjoy!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung. Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you."
"Mr. Krabs"," Certainly."
"Squidward"," Oh boy."
"Patrick"," Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing."
"SpongeBob","  Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something?  Oh!  Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!"
"Sandy","  Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah!  Well, you’re still no match for my squirrel-fu!  It’s a letter from my twin brother, Randy!"
"Patrick"," Doesn’t bother me."
"SpongeBob"," Karate? "
"Sandy"," No!"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Rodeo!♪"
"SpongeBob"," So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help."
"Squidward"," Oh, no! Sally’s in trouble!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy’s in trouble. I need help rescuing her."
"Mr. Krabs"," Where the devil are we?"
"Plankton"," Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there.  That's perfect!  PERFECT!  Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say ""No"" to a helpless little grandma!  Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Goodness, no!  Here you are."
"Plankton"," It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!"
"Plankton"," Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. "
"Plankton"," Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?"
"Plankton"," Why, yes!  HOW CAN YOU DRINK THIS DRECK?!  Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, ""More, please.""  "
"Plankton"," No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I COULD EAT A VILLAGE!"
"Plankton"," AAAH!"
"SpongeBob"," My great-grammyma!  She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy."
"SpongeBob"," Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties."
"SpongeBob"," Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?"
"SpongeBob"," Sweet dreams, Grammyma. "
"Mr. Krabs"," There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!"
"SpongeBob"," Done and done!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet.  Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat. "
"SpongeBob"," I'm sure he is. Bye."
"SpongeBob"," Ah ha! That should do it!  Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he needs me to do anymore impossible jobs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Get ready for it now, boy me boy!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Thank you for your money!  Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you have work you should be doing?"
"SpongeBob"," That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who do you think you are!  Jackpot! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy."
"Patrick"," Snow globes are always funny.  Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go."
"Patrick"," Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him."
"SpongeBob"," I would be delighted to meet him."
"Patrick"," And this is my home."
"SpongeBob"," Where is your home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home."
"Patrick"," He's gonna smash Squidward's place now. "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, I don't-- "
"Squidward"," I live here.  And what's so funny?"
"Patrick"," Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me."
"Patrick"," It really crushes my heart to see him go."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, crushes. Patrick, ""crushes""—that gives me an idea. "
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm, strange indeed..."
"SpongeBob"," Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs. We gotta find him!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward."
"Squidward"," Oh, my neck."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on...  Ah ha, playing hard to get, weren't you little one?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's the matter, boy-o?  You're Krabby Patty meter is on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or-  Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one-  ...Krabby Patty. "
"SpongeBob"," Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there urr... there is no way out."
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here.  So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business."
"SpongeBob"," Totally Not Our Problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Pearl, he's okay. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, backwards, what a stupid idea that-"
"Mr. Krabs"," Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back ."
"SpongeBob"," You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us."
"Mr. Krabs"," So, it's true!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed."
"Squidward"," And why is that?"
"Squidward"," I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you."
"SpongeBob"," Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-"
"SpongeBob"," It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up."
"Mr. Krabs"," He's awake!"
"SpongeBob","  Morning, already.  I'm coming Mr. Krabs  Don't go anywhere!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Good job ladee!"
"Squidward"," Don't touch me."
"Patrick"," Uh-huh. "
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ha!  Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug.  Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug."
"Mr. Krabs"," Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Anyway,  it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell. "
"Patrick"," Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up!  Hey! A baby tooth!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?"
"Patrick"," Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer."
"Plankton","  The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist."
"SpongeBob"," I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's out."
"Squidward","  Another miserable day..."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it's moving!"
"Patrick"," Hey, that's usually what I say!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, he's taking evasive action."
"SpongeBob"," Ow, I think I ruptured a spleen..."
"SpongeBob"," Look, Patrick! He's gonna play us a little song. "
"SpongeBob"," Looks like we're on a roll, eh, Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Toodles."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand."
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days."
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt."
"SpongeBob"," Scabs, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all."
"Plankton"," Ow."
"Mr. Krabs"," I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Take care of yourself, little formula."
"Mr. Krabs"," Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! "
"SpongeBob"," Couldn't be better, butler."
"Patrick"," Peek-a-boo!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters."
"SpongeBob"," Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sorry, ma'am."
"Plankton"," You calling me a liar?"
"SpongeBob"," If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler."
"SpongeBob"," I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. "
"Patrick"," I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little ""accident"" earlier."
"SpongeBob"," Well, that is great news."
"Plankton","  It's too easy. "
"Plankton","I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs","  Sure. I believe ya.  Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton.  Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?"
"SpongeBob"," I simply refused to fail, sir."
"SpongeBob","  And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?"
"Patrick"," No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce."
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick.  Patrick! Call me!"
"Patrick"," No.  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick?"
"Patrick"," Tag! You're it!"
"SpongeBob"," Peek-a-boo! I see you!"
"Squidward","  Must... block... out... noise! "
"Patrick"," Knock, knock!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's there?"
"Squidward"," Where are those two morons?  Where are they?!"
"Patrick"," Must've been something it ate. "
"SpongeBob"," It ate Squidward!"
"Squidward"," That was an insult."
"Patrick"," And we're insulted!"
"Squidward"," Thank you?!?"
"Patrick"," You're welcome."
"Squidward"," And I'm gonna play ""Sit and Relax"" until you're finished.  Barnacle brains.  SpongeBob! "
"Squidward"," Two!"
"Patrick"," He's already at number two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?"
"Plankton"," Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts."
"Squidward","  You... two... morons... sunk my house!"
"Patrick"," Uhhuh!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to..."
"Patrick"," Then teach me."
"SpongeBob"," As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility."
"Patrick"," What?! I...!  Barnacles!"
"SpongeBob","  Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!"
"SpongeBob"," Ahhh... better luck next time. "
"Patrick"," I'm a genius?"
"SpongeBob"," Not that!  ...this.  With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, look, it's Patrick!"
"Patrick"," What do you say to a trade? "
"Patrick","  NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! "
"Patrick"," Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA! "
"SpongeBob"," Pull it together, buddy!"
"Patrick","  So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?"
"Patrick"," Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray for regeneration!"
"Patrick"," Oh I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies."
"SpongeBob"," Sir, yes, sir!"
"Squidward"," Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee. "
"SpongeBob","  You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!"
"Patrick","  SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?"
"Squidward"," Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...?  What t-.."
"Patrick"," Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now."
"Squidward","  Get off me! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry? "
"Patrick"," I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years."
"Squidward"," That's it, this game is over! "
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmmm. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?"
"Plankton"," Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe! "
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob"," We're using the advanced rules."
"Patrick"," You're right. Let's go poke someone else."
"SpongeBob","  How about instead we do something extra special for him? Then he won't be sad anymore!"
"Patrick"," Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?"
"SpongeBob"," I like it!"
"Squidward"," It's, it's, it's... beautiful! It's too good to be true! It's a mirage. I knew it."
"Squidward"," Remember Squiddy, just go with it."
"Squidward"," My world!"
"Patrick"," You were right, SpongeBob, we should have used glue instead of earwax."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears."
"Squidward","  Yeah, make it last, "
"SpongeBob"," Glove World!! Glove World!! Glove World!!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, okay! Patrick, I'll catch the next bus! See you there! "
"Sandy"," Operation acorn smoothie is a success!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you've got to learn to say 'no'. Stand up for yourself! You need thicker skin like me! . Oh, hey, which reminds me.  Could you scratch my back?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure. "
"SpongeBob","  Ah, It fits like a glove!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪I've got an abrasive side! Abrasive side, abrasive side! I've got an abrasive side, and now I can say no! Abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side! Now I can say --♪"
"SpongeBob","  Have a nice day, Grandma. "
"Sandy","  Howdy, SpongeBob! You're right on time to help me test out my new disappearator. It'll make anything disappear instantly. Now hold still and I'll just shave a few inches off the top of your noggin."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure thing Mr..."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Phew. Thank you, Sandy! You too, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"SpongeBob"," It's a sign!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Gary!  Just the pal I'm looking for. Want to hear my new record?  I knew you would! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid?  You were nearly late this morning. You got to be more concientierous or I'll have to start dockin' your pay. Oh, yeah. That's what I'll do.  Doo dee doo, doo dee doo, doo doo doo!  Musical Doodle! SpongeBob! Wake up, boy-o! Don't you need some patties to get started there?"
"SpongeBob"," Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled.  Me customers!  Why are you running off? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh-huh. Stop singin' that song! One more outburst out of me and I'll send ye home for the day!"
"SpongeBob"," Trying to escape is futile! ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!♪ "
"Sandy"," What's his deal?"
"Patrick"," Hey, buddy!"
"Sandy"," SpongeBob!"
"Sandy"," Just as I thought. You're suffering from a condition known as ""Earworm."" You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there."
"Sandy"," Oh, right. Squidward. You play that little doohickey."
"SpongeBob"," I'm playing hide and seek with Patrick and I was wondering if I could search for him in your house."
"Mr. Krabs"," Patty's kr  What the...  TIME FOR THE SHELTER! Doomsday came sooner than I thought."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs up here!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! THAT MAKES ME FURIOUS!"
"SpongeBob"," The fee?"
"Mr. Krabs"," OK! Good luck finding him!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Mrs. Puff."
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you sure you're sure you're sure you're sure?"
"SpongeBob"," Looking for Patrick. I've been seeking and seeking all day but I can't find him."
"Sandy"," Oh, that's terrible news."
"SpongeBob"," Yes. Yes absolutely.  Thanks again Sandy"
"Sandy"," Be careful! [Hole breaks in treedome. SpongeBob searches everywhere. Cut scene to map of Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob"," Exactly."
"SpongeBob"," I can't believe it! Patrick it really is you."
"SpongeBob"," Yeah"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! You were under there the whole time?"
"Patrick"," I still have one question."
"SpongeBob"," Ask away."
"Mr. Krabs"," Closing time already?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh! Right! Okay, that make- Wait, what's tomorrow?"
"SpongeBob"," Tomorrow is ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day!"
"SpongeBob"," A fresh batch?"
"Plankton"," Okay, now what's he saying?"
"SpongeBob","  Great, Gary,just great! Now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not going to come down from there, are you?"
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ha there you are Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for ""Bring your pet to work day""! And today is the day!   First I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
"SpongeBob","  Bet that feel good, huh?"
"SpongeBob","  We gotta get you to the pet hospital!"
"Plankton","  Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Gary! "
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know it's really poignant."
"SpongeBob","  Just a little further, Gare-bare."
"Plankton"," Yes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, he takes after you, lad.  Pay?!"
"Squidward"," Shut it SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret."
"Mr. Krabs","  Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Boy, stop this nonsense!"
"SpongeBob"," I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax.  And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo."
"Squidward"," For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?"
"Squidward"," Oh, I don't know, 12?"
"Mr. Krabs"," As advertised."
"Squidward"," I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir."
"Squidward"," And don't dilly...  ...dally. Nice rock."
"Mr. Krabs"," Did you hear something?  Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?"
"Squidward"," As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Do you think we caused an earthquake by hitting the ground too hard?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're leaking."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, do you mind? I've gotta wring myself out."
"Patrick"," What are those things?"
"Patrick"," Can't talk, Running! "
"Sandy"," How can I be sure you're not whelks in disguise?"
"Sandy","  You're in.  I think I have the answer! Now, do ya want the regular answer, or the ACTION PACKED answer?!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, look!"
"Squidward"," Oh, so hilarious."
"Patrick"," "
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, it is."
"SpongeBob"," ...an innie!"
"Patrick"," Aw, man! Pulled out the big guns. Color. Color."
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick","  Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous! "
"Patrick"," Tartar sauce!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?"
"Patrick"," I thought for sure I had that one."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?"
"Patrick"," Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?"
"SpongeBob"," What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?"
"Patrick","  Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis..."
"SpongeBob"," Time's up! "
"Squidward"," So, who won your stupid quiz?"
"Patrick"," It was a tie."
"Squidward"," Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! "
"Patrick"," Oh, can I borrow five bucks?"
"SpongeBob"," Here! Take your dirty, rotten money!  Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! "
"Patrick"," Oh hey there, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob","  Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. "
"SpongeBob","  Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! "
"Sandy","  What a crybaby."
"SpongeBob","  Hold it right there, Patrick! "
"Patrick"," While Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks."
"SpongeBob"," I know, he is pretty amazing..."
"Patrick","  I got a pair for me too! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick!  How do I look?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend. "
"Patrick","  Busy, I'll catch up with you later."
"Patrick","  This is my worst nightmare!! I don't have a drink!"
"Patrick"," Okay, Okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall. "
"Patrick","  Nice facilities. Great water pressure. "
"Squidward","  Sigh...Once in awhile, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life...Talking to myself...again..."
"Squidward"," Pinch yourself you ninny."
"SpongeBob"," I had this horrible dream. That Mr. Krabs would never let me cook Krabby Patties again. "
"SpongeBob","  Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," And what about my… my spatula? "
"SpongeBob"," Aye aye, captain. "
"Squidward"," Actually, yes."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"Squidward"," The wiener!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, blow up.  Squidward, that's it! "
"SpongeBob","  Wait for it SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now! "
"SpongeBob"," Oooh! I know the answer."
"Mr. Krabs"," Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy! "
"Patrick"," Hey, try to catch me, SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Tag, you're it."
"Patrick"," Oh, I like not knowing! Let's play!"
"Patrick"," Look at all this cool stuff!  I'm the captain!  Yo, ho, ho, ya mateys! Arr!  Got ya! En garde!  Thanks, SpongeBob. I guess we better be more careful."
"SpongeBob"," Let's go back to the main deck."
"Squidward","  Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says ""Mauna Loa""."
"SpongeBob"," I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret."
"Mr. Krabs","  Heh, jokers."
"Mr. Krabs","  Out of me way, boy.  I knew it. The lost treasure of the Mauna Loa is finally mine! I can practically taste them jewels.  It's a little lighter than I thought. Huh? It's empty.  No good. Ha, ha, very clever, captain. Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens? It's not the Wreck of the Mauna Loa, It's ""The Wreck of the Mauna Loa"" amusement park ride! "
"SpongeBob"," Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun.  Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas. Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!"
"Squidward","  Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa. Arr. How may I help you?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh-ho-ho, I disagree. I'd say the little  feller's just right. "
"Patrick"," Yeah! Totally realistic!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!"
"Squidward"," Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!"
"Patrick","  Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?"
"Squidward"," Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward."
"Squidward"," Hello, Howard."
"Squidward","  Passions?"
"Squidward","  Wait! Don't go!' ' I was...just kidding!"
"Squidward","  Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors."
"Squidward"," Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! "
"Patrick"," Spongebob, look!"
"Squidward"," I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation. "
"SpongeBob"," Well why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?"
"Squidward"," I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before."
"SpongeBob"," Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?"
"SpongeBob"," The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress."
"SpongeBob"," But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 800 sound, Squilvia?"
"SpongeBob"," I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?"
"Squidward"," Um...You look...stunning?"
"Squidward"," Go where?"
"Squidward","  There!"
"Squidward"," Can we go now?"
"Squidward"," Gotcha."
"Squidward"," Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?  Which, by the way begins in five minutes. "
"Squidward"," Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be."
"Squidward"," Huh?"
"Patrick"," I cleaned my rock just for you. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Huh?"
"Squidward"," Oh I mean it alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Squidward, you jokester."
"Patrick"," Awwww hey sis, don't listen to those...meanies. Hey the new rock is looking kinda...boring. What do you say we decorate it?"
"Squidward"," Hey you can't do that, that's my window!"
"Patrick"," Come on sis they won't bother us under our rock."
"Patrick"," Your still my rock big sis."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control."
"Patrick"," Well uh...well...well it's about your temper Sam."
"Sandy","  It worked! Hooray! "
"Plankton","  Because today I have completed my greatest invention. Behold! "
"Plankton","  It worked! In this new gaseous form, I will be able to silently squeeze through the cracks of the Krusty Krab. Ehahahahaha!"
"Sandy"," Hold on! You can't go, SpongeBob. We need you."
"Plankton"," What! He'll just get in the way!"
"Sandy"," Ready!"
"Plankton"," Roger!  Urgh! Just a sec. "
"Sandy"," Oh, well.  Try again. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Eugh! I see. So it was you that befouled me office earlier, was it? "
"SpongeBob"," Do you think this is a good look for me? Or is it too flashy?"
"Sandy","  Stand clear!"
"Squidward"," I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself.  What the-  Oh, thank you. "
"SpongeBob"," Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom. "
"SpongeBob","  The Krabby Patty formula! But if that's here, then where's Plankton? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I didn't even know you had ankles."
"Squidward"," As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job."
"SpongeBob"," It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid! "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, sure. "
"Plankton"," Aren'tcha gonna try and take it back from me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, goodness no. You go ahead. Take it."
"SpongeBob"," The Flabby Patty?"
"Plankton","  Sweet Flabby Patty, here I come! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Dig, SpongeBob, dig."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think we're here. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Where are you hiding?  Ooo, there you are my sweetie."
"Plankton","  Stand aside, restaurant critic coming through!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks like you blew it again, Plankton."
"SpongeBob","  Now, now, I think we all need to calm down. Fighting is pointless. You two would have the recipe by now if you only worked together."
"Plankton"," Yeah, I don't see that workin' out."
"SpongeBob"," See? You guys are agreeing already. That's the first step to cooperation. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Little more. Little more."
"Plankton"," One tablespoon listening. Two tablespoons...understanding? Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fold in warm heart. Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. It's a recipe for friendship."
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And why is that, Mr. Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Because then you'd only get to repair it once."
"Squidward"," Time to get out the dental floss. Ha. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You mean for you."
"Squidward","  It'll cost you money."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," OK, but, I got something better. A menu made with napkins and tape, A microphone system made of tin cans, and this sign... I made it from an old noodle."
"SpongeBob"," How is this stuff better?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Problem solved!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh? Here comes one now!"
"Squidward"," Nobody huh? Ok, I'll just toss it in the trash."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well that's nice! I'm still billing you for the damages!"
"SpongeBob"," Sure thing Larry!  Gehh! Gehh!"
"SpongeBob"," Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's sub!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well...don't you worry Mr. Mayor! I have a answer for that too!  There you go! See now we have two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! ."
"Squidward","  No no no! Not that window! The other one!"
"Plankton"," Chum Nuggets...get them before  my arm falls off..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Gasp! They're everywhere!"
"Squidward"," Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs! We got to do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey? Somebody eating potato chips?"
"SpongeBob","  ♪Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!♪  For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you sir."

"SpongeBob"," Right here, right now? A little short notice...  let me check my availability.  Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!"
"SpongeBob"," I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!"
"SpongeBob"," Grrr... GRRR! "
"SpongeBob"," How should I know!? He's YOUR dad!"
"Patrick","  Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged. "
"Squidward","  Hey! Hello? Nitwit, morons."
"Squidward"," Just don't let it happen again! Or else. "
"Patrick"," Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win."
"SpongeBob"," I think you're missing the point. "
"Patrick"," Looks like we're tied, three shots to three."
"SpongeBob"," Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots."
"Patrick"," I have no idea what you're talking about."
"SpongeBob"," Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you.  Oops."
"Patrick"," Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet."
"SpongeBob"," But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!"
"Patrick"," Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, have you seen by ball?"
"Patrick"," Don't worry, I'll get it."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no!"
"Patrick"," Uh-oh."
"SpongeBob"," Play it where it lies."
"Patrick"," Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick... "
"Patrick"," I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you please get back in the game?"
"Patrick"," Play it where it lies."
"SpongeBob"," But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?"
"Patrick"," But I thought we weren't betting."
"SpongeBob"," No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?!"
"SpongeBob"," Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?"
"SpongeBob","  Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?"
"SpongeBob"," Vacate? You mean I have to move?"
"SpongeBob"," No. I'll be strong. "
"Squidward","  Oh, good grief. "
"SpongeBob","  Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump! "
"Patrick"," Nice dress. "
"Patrick"," I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want!  Good thing I brought out the heavy artillery  Gooey Worms!"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Patrick, those don't move."
"Patrick"," I dunno."
"SpongeBob"," Hop in. We'll give you a lift.  Come on, Gary!"
"Sandy","  Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  Much appreciate it, boy! "
"Squidward"," No! Singing!"
"Sandy"," Huh?"
"Squidward","  Oh... not again... "
"SpongeBob"," What is that formidable creature?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, my! Well at least you bravely escaped out the tail."
"Patrick","  We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile. "
"Sandy"," A citylacra!"
"Patrick"," Great, now we're stuck."
"SpongeBob"," No, we're not! We'll-- Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body."
"Sandy"," We must be heading in the right direction!"
"Plankton","   Secret formula, you are mine! "
"Mr. Krabs"," My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!"
"Squidward","  We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh."
"SpongeBob","  No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!"
"Patrick"," Hahahaha!"
"Plankton"," Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! "
"Plankton"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?"
"Plankton","  Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
"SpongeBob"," Is that a yes?"
"Squidward"," We may have to find you clothes as well."
"Patrick"," New clothes?"
"Squidward","  Excuse me! Grown-ups do not high-five!"
"Patrick"," Oh, right!"
"SpongeBob","  We do do da do do de! "
"Squidward"," Indeed..."
"Patrick"," Security! "
"SpongeBob"," Please be gentle!  Heh, that's weird I thought I was gonna get tossed out on my...  AHHHHHHHHH! "
"SpongeBob"," No please!"
"Squidward"," What the?!"
"Patrick"," She's beautiful!"
"SpongeBob","  There's once, was a man, from Nantucket.  Sorry, wrong one! AHEM! ♪Dear friend, don't say that over! As long as I breathe, I will cherish our bond!♪"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! "
"Squidward"," That's what I thought you- No! No! No! I didn't mean it like that! It was-"
"SpongeBob"," I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything. "
"Patrick"," Okay. "
"SpongeBob"," "
"Patrick"," Fine."
"SpongeBob","  Boating safe..."
"Patrick"," Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?"
"Patrick"," That's it!  Fight through! "
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!"
"Patrick","  Young man, how dare you! "
"SpongeBob"," Wha, a detention slip?"
"Patrick"," Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. "
"Patrick"," Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one."
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!"
"SpongeBob"," That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working."
"Sandy"," Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick."
"Patrick","  Go on, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?"
"SpongeBob"," --""for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care""."
"Patrick"," Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock.  He had a lump on his head—"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—"
"Plankton"," He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?"
"Plankton"," Too late! "
"Plankton"," You do?"
"Plankton"," Yes, it—not buying that one either, huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music."
"Squidward","  Not again."
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Want to... sing?"
"Squidward"," Thank you, thank you."
"Squidward"," That's an understatement."
"Squidward"," Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing ""doorslam"" and I was wondering if I could—"
"Squidward"," Once again, I hate people."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hi Squid...  Whoa!  I love your hat."
"SpongeBob"," We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  I made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  And I also made this cute little scallop house."
"Squidward"," Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  Witness ""La Vista Squidward""! Stunning, isn't it?"
"Squidward"," No, wait, come back!"
"SpongeBob"," We both are. It's lots of fun! Would you like to make something, too?"
"SpongeBob"," How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?"
"Patrick"," Um...ok!  Art! "
"Patrick"," So long, my trusted, yet untalented friend!  One for you! And one for you! And one for...  I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!"
"Squidward"," Oh, not you again! May I take your order?"
"Patrick","  Uuuuuummmmm! Uhhhhhhhhh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty."
"Patrick"," Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, that's terrible.."
"Squidward","  Why don't you just concentrate on your patty? "
"Patrick","  Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do! "
"Patrick"," It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50. "
"Sandy","  ""Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!"" Oh SpongeBob this sounds too good to be true!"" "
"SpongeBob"," I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?"
"Squidward"," How 'bout the latte sipping?"
"Sandy"," And let's not forget the science fair!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! "
"SpongeBob"," Where?"
"Patrick","  And forts."
"SpongeBob"," And a water park!  Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it.  I can't wait to get there! How about you?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah!"
"Patrick","  Okay find me!"
"Patrick","  Because it happens every time I keep my cheese fizz in my back pocket!  Darn! It's almost empty!"
"SpongeBob","  Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it.  This is fun! Hey Patrick, you gotta try thi-"
"Patrick","  Oh, hey SpongeBob! How'd ya get there?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I was on this see-saw-"
"Patrick"," Okay.  It's not working."
"SpongeBob","  Go back and forth like this.  There you go! Now you're getting into the... SWING of things! "
"Patrick","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Are you okay?"
"SpongeBob"," It's getting closer!  Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do?"
"Patrick"," I saw something like this in a movie once! Now watch closely, and do exactly what I do!"
"SpongeBob"," Rodger!"
"SpongeBob"," Now put 'em there, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Boring.  Lame. "
"Squidward","  Not likely.  Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?!  Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet."
"SpongeBob"," So tired.  Patrick, what are you doing here?"
"SpongeBob"," Well, that's not the can-do spirit. "
"SpongeBob"," Free tickets to what, Mr. Krabs?  You and a guest have won a week of relaxation on a luxury ocean cruise ship!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, I suppose I could make that extra ticket available to, say, whoever is to be me man-servant?"
"Plankton"," Let me give you a hand with that, honey. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, ha ha ha! Now push me back to the top, push me to the top!"
"Plankton"," Whew, that was close. "
"Plankton"," AGGHHHH!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh yeah!"
"Plankton","  AAHHHHH!  Alright, alright! I give up! I know what I'm beat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oo, what's all this? Free Land Food, sounds so exotic.  Huh, this looks promising.  That tastes like putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce."
"SpongeBob"," A good fry cook is never far from his grill, sir. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Come to daddy!  Hey, wait a minute, there's chum all over this bill. Hey, buddy! Where did you get this?"
"SpongeBob"," Stand back, sir. Leave this to your trusty man-servant. "
"Sandy","  Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think...  You see,  Someone already made six copies."
"Patrick"," Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing."
"SpongeBob"," I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip!  Hey Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy..."
"Sandy"," Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight."
"SpongeBob"," Wha, wha, wha, why not?"
"Sandy"," Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!"
"SpongeBob"," Roger that! Folding hands."
"Sandy"," Now, get ready for lunar module se…"
"SpongeBob"," What's moon crater boarding?"
"Sandy"," You ride these on that like this.  Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah.  Right there is the classic Texas tail grab.  And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop.  Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite The Tour to Saturn.  Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn."
"SpongeBob","  Ok. "
"Sandy"," Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick?  Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”"
"SpongeBob"," "
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!?"
"SpongeBob","  🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man!  Hey travel buddies!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Is this the most exciting day in you life?"
"SpongeBob"," Bill? "
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is starting at us.  Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh!  Uh... uh..."
"SpongeBob"," Wow! It's-"
"Mr. Krabs","   Shoes?"
"SpongeBob"," Aah. Patrick, don't you love staring at clouds and thinking about what they look like?"
"Patrick"," Sure does! Um... who's Mr. Krabs again? Oh, now that cloud looks like a flying houseboat."
"SpongeBob"," Um, Patrick, I think that really is a flying houseboat."
"Patrick"," Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I'll be right there!"
"Patrick"," We do!"
"Patrick"," Oh, whoops! You're right. I almost forgot. You're coin-operated, aren't you? "
"Patrick","  They're good!"
"Patrick"," Where's my pizza? What kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow?"
"Patrick","  Houseboat full of ghosts!"
"SpongeBob"," Eww, eww, eww, eww!"
"SpongeBob"," Aah. That hits the spot!"
"Patrick"," Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat."
"SpongeBob"," But what about our real souls?"
"Patrick"," Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts."
"Patrick"," Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!"
"Sandy"," Got ya, you little gremlin!"
"Patrick"," Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know, Patrick. All the TV's in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick."
"SpongeBob","  Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!"
"SpongeBob"," Push-a-what?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Cabbage, green backs, money!"
"Plankton"," Oh Karen, if only you could just see things way I do. "
"Plankton"," Karen, my dear, I think you're onto something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!"
"SpongeBob"," Hi Plankton!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk! "
"Plankton"," Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!  Mommy! Here comes the pain!  That wasn't so bad. Uh oh, here we go.  Eureka!"
"Plankton"," I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day! "
"Plankton"," Nonsense, You're imagining things."
"Plankton"," Uhh..."
"Plankton"," Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Since when do you care about stealing?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!"
"Plankton"," My life of evil is over.  Hey, why is it so dark in here?"
"Plankton"," Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers!  Oh well. Depth perception's overrated anyway. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Didn't you already mop this area?"
"SpongeBob"," Why wouldn't I? "
"SpongeBob"," I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!"
"SpongeBob"," I took him to see a hypnotist."
"SpongeBob","  He was a really good hypnotist."
"SpongeBob","  Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?"
"SpongeBob","  Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Krabby Patty essence."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, boy, the mail's here!  What do we have today?  Gas bill... taxes... letter to SpongeBob from  Gramma! "
"SpongeBob","  My daddy is going away. Can you take care of me...eow? "
"SpongeBob","  Ok, Patrick. There you are!"
"Patrick","  Ooh, coral balls."
"SpongeBob","   I'm gonna miss you, little guy. But I know you are going to be in good hands."
"Patrick"," Well, of course I am!  Now, go see your Gramma. Gary's in good hands.  Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend."
"Patrick","  Better. "
"Patrick"," I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge. "
"SpongeBob","  Gramma, can I please use your phone?"
"Patrick"," Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning to you too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab. "
"SpongeBob"," AAAAHHHHH! Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me?  Aaaaaah!! Today is Sunday?! But that means..."
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh."
"Sandy"," Here's a comprehensive list of ""do""s and ""don't""s to follow. "
"SpongeBob"," Wow...!"
"Sandy"," ...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal. "
"SpongeBob"," I respect your meticulous nature."
"Sandy","  Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," Yep."
"Sandy"," Are you really sure?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! There you are!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks."
"Patrick"," There you go.  "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick,  I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome."
"Patrick"," All right, let's go!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility."
"Patrick"," Pretty please?"
"SpongeBob"," No way."
"Patrick"," AND A SCOOP OF NUTS!!"
"SpongeBob"," Deal."
"Patrick","  I wasn't touching anything!"
"SpongeBob"," Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!"
"Patrick"," Not... touch anything."
"SpongeBob"," Mm-hmm. What else."
"Patrick"," Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting."
"SpongeBob","  Good boy, Patrick!"
"Sandy"," And i'm setting it to maximum power."
"Sandy"," Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster."
"SpongeBob"," Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him."
"SpongeBob"," You forgot to buy a ticket?"
"SpongeBob"," Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be."
"SpongeBob"," Whoa, just look at that lemonade line."
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Why don't I get one for you?"
"Squidward"," Don't mind if I do groove."
"Squidward"," No I don't—ketchup?"
"Patrick"," Tummy want more. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy."
"Squidward"," What? What? Who said that?"
"SpongeBob"," Let's go to Sandy's."
"Patrick"," Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb."
"SpongeBob"," I know Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. "
"Sandy"," That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. "
"Sandy"," Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," She's totally losing it."
"Patrick"," Don't worry. She's not going anywhere."
"SpongeBob"," Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down."
"Patrick"," Just a little bit further. Okay, got it. "
"SpongeBob"," Hurry up, Patrick. "
"Sandy"," Hm-mmm. "
"Squidward"," I said what? "
"Patrick"," An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy."
"SpongeBob"," I know. Wish me luck, old friend. "
"Patrick"," Ah, ah! Oof! "
"SpongeBob","  Welcome back, Sandy. "
"Sandy"," I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?"
"Sandy"," That's my friend SpongeBob SquarePants."
"SpongeBob"," But Sandy, you already have a black belt."
"Sandy"," Yes but there's one even higher than that!  The blacker belt!"
"SpongeBob"," Hm?"
"SpongeBob"," In turn I will! "
"SpongeBob"," My match!  I can't get outta here!"
"Squidward"," Sigh...which is why I keep telling you Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!"
"Sandy"," Told ya!"
"SpongeBob","  Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here.  It's the onions! They've gone bad! "
"Sandy"," And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?"
"Sandy"," That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?"
"Sandy"," This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people."
"Sandy"," What's that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Sandy"," I don't know, Mr. Krabs. I can't predict what's going to happen."
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Waste of a perfectly Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Patty... becoming... awkward..."
"Mr. Krabs"," The grocery store."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, why did you make that weird noi-  Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen!  Nooooooo! Huh?  Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!"
"Plankton","  What's this?  Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?!  Ah, I'd better get a closer look.   Out of my way, you fools!"
"Patrick"," Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," That wasn't a dream!"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy?"
"Sandy"," No, SpongeBob! Up here!  And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!"
"Sandy"," And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty."
"SpongeBob"," Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain."
"Mr. Krabs"," Step right up folks! For a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! Two! Medium-rare!"
"SpongeBob","  Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see Dear, SpongeBob..."
"SpongeBob"," You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun."
"SpongeBob","  I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you."
"SpongeBob"," Shiny, where are you going?  ""Scissor Works""? Hold on, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Did you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed! "
"Squidward","  What am I doing!? What are you doing!?"
"Squidward"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward? "
"Squidward"," Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you."
"Mr. Krabs"," It'll stand. Oh, unless you'd rather talk with SpongeBob."
"Squidward"," What?"
"Patrick"," Can I watch you work?"
"Squidward"," No! No! No! No!   Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!   Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick! "
"Squidward"," Hello...you..."
"Patrick"," I just finished cleaning the restroom!"
"Squidward"," Patrick! "
"Squidward"," How long you want to live? "
"Patrick","  Hah hah! Squidward's funny!  Hey, a button!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh no! My two best friends are fighting!  But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off!  I'm sorry, restraining order! But my friends need me!  Stop!"
"Patrick","  Squidward?  Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well when were you going to tell me?"
"SpongeBob","  I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"
"SpongeBob"," Really, Squidward?"
"Patrick","  Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished, I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesday! "
"SpongeBob"," Great idea, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  Ohh, what is this?"
"SpongeBob"," Uhh, I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune."
"SpongeBob"," No, you need to turn yourself in."
"SpongeBob"," Really?"
"Squidward","  Hey, don't I get a phone call?"
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories."
"SpongeBob"," Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy."
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory."
"SpongeBob"," Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!"
"Squidward"," This is not my happiest memory..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!"
"Squidward","  Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!"
"Squidward"," And now he's melted it... Not a happiest memory..."
"Squidward","  Very nice... except that I'm afraid of heights!"
"Squidward"," Yes...  Thanks for stopping by. "
"SpongeBob"," Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!"
"SpongeBob"," Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea."
"SpongeBob"," Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back."
"SpongeBob"," I hate mayonnaise and mustard."
"SpongeBob","  Good one Jellien Sandy."
"Sandy"," "
"Sandy"," Hold it right there you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em SpongeBob!"
"Plankton"," No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!"
"Plankton"," It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!"
"Plankton"," That's it. "
"SpongeBob"," What is going on out there?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices."
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't you say it, boy."
"SpongeBob"," But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me."
"Mr. Krabs"," NO! "
"Squidward"," I can't feel my legs."
"SpongeBob"," You mean, different.  That's it!"
"SpongeBob"," It's working!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here."
"SpongeBob"," Hear what?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Sorry, Gary. You want to eat, huh? Don't worry, I can fix both problems."
"Patrick","  Say no more, buddy!"
"SpongeBob"," Hurry, Patrick! I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
"Patrick"," Oh, nothing. I'm just hanging with the sponge. How about you?"
"Patrick"," Oh take your time..."
"SpongeBob"," Holding steady Patrick. But, who knows how long this support system will last?"
"Mr. Krabs"," And, Squidward! I expect more from you. Well, actually, no... I don't."
"Patrick","  I'm here because... wait a minute, why am I here? SpongeBob, I'm having another exit pencils crisis!"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. And Squidward has done a great job holding it up."
"Mr. Krabs","  Well... I suppose I could join the cause. But, it'll have to be our standard deal."
"Sandy","  Perfectly calibrated!  OW! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but I kind of liked my pineapple the way it was. I don't need all these fancy- "
"Sandy"," Sorry, buddy. I-I can't understand you. You've got something in your mouth."
"Sandy"," Well, what do you think, SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes?"
"SpongeBob"," It's, uh..."
"SpongeBob"," Well, Gary. There's only one thing left to do  call and have this place condemned.  Hello, operator. City hall, please, Office of Broken Dreams."
"Plankton"," Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry."
"Plankton"," I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package."
"Plankton"," Huh, what happened?"
"SpongeBob","  Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet."
"SpongeBob"," This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system."
"Mr. Krabs"," Huh. He always has been a knucklehead."
"Mr. Krabs"," Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady."
"SpongeBob"," Must be the dial-up thingy"
"Mr. Krabs"," Help me out here, buddy. "
"SpongeBob"," All right!"
"Squidward"," My order?"
"SpongeBob"," No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world The Krusty Krab."
"Squidward"," SpongeBob!  Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen.  We need another Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!"
"Patrick"," That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out. "
"SpongeBob","  I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?"
"Patrick"," Funny faces make me laugh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good. I hope you've learned your lesson."
"Patrick"," Done and done."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face."
"Patrick","  Aye yi yi yi!"
"SpongeBob","  Aw!"
"Patrick"," Ah ah ooh!"
"SpongeBob"," Duh!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay, okay."
"Mr. Krabs"," Penny, penny, penny, penny."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, dear."
"SpongeBob"," Ah! Guests! May I offer you some lemonade?"
"Patrick"," Close Glove World!?! Has the world gone mad?! "
"Patrick"," A penny saved is a penny gloved!"
"SpongeBob"," You can leave a glove to glove, but you can't make it glove."
"Patrick"," For all time's right sake."
"Patrick"," We'll miss you. "
"SpongeBob"," Goodbye Glove Drop."
"Patrick"," Come on buddy. Let's take our seats. "
"SpongeBob"," Ow!"
"Patrick"," Oh oh! Glove Ice cream!  Thanks! "
"Patrick"," Yeah brother! We're chaining ourselves, through a gate."
"SpongeBob"," Well, uh..."
"Squidward"," Oh, really."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward. Squidward. Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle."
"Squidward"," But Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it."
"Squidward"," But the customers. You don't want them to get sick, do you?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh this. It's a number 2 Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink..."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Squidward."
"SpongeBob","  Mis...ter...Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that."
"SpongeBob"," But Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!"
"Squidward"," Yippee! Thank you, Mr. Krabs! I mean "
"SpongeBob"," My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  That's funny. My eyes feel itchy.  And my throat feels scratchy, too.  Itchy eyes, scratchy throat...  even my mouth feels dry!  I've contracted... Squid's Disease! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well how about a little less pleasure and a little more work. "
"SpongeBob","  Yes, everything's fine in here.  Just dandy.  I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious.  This super hot spicy yellow mustard should do the trick. No, actually that burns real bad.  Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some—  pickles! Pickles, they're like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come.  Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns! "
"SpongeBob"," I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right Squidward?  Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next."
"SpongeBob"," It's  driving test day!"
"SpongeBob"," Look out, extra credit! Here I come!"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Oh, dear. I think I'm in that fellow's way.  Engage turn signals. Adjust mirrors. Hands at ten and two, and finally floor it. ."
"SpongeBob","  What's that Mrs. Puff? ."
"SpongeBob"," Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," Snail Bites. "
"SpongeBob","  Gary! It is 400 in the morning! What exactly do you want from me?! "
"SpongeBob","  Ok, Gary, I'm off to the Krusty Krab!  Hope your day is as fun-filled as mine! Whoa! Gary?!  Yes, so, I will see you tonight, Gary.  Gary, is that a box of Snail Bites in your teeth? He, he. That's funny, because I think I just saw a half-full box in the kitchen.   "
"SpongeBob"," I know, you want more Snail Bites. But the pet store was completely sold out of them!"
"SpongeBob","  Thanks a lot.  You're what!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you mind being quiet for one second, please!"
"Patrick"," Well, you gotta be firm, SpongeBob! Sometimes, you have to no when to say know. Oh, wait, wait, wait, it's the other way around. You have to know when to say ""no"". Yeah, that's it!"
"SpongeBob"," But I don't know how to say no, Patrick!"
"Patrick"," Stop it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Eh, uh, no. He's out of town."
"SpongeBob"," Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?"
"Plankton"," Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, he's getting close."
"Mr. Krabs"," 500298, 500299, 500300.  I win."
"Plankton"," You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't."
"SpongeBob"," I cleaned it this morning."
"Mr. Krabs"," Drat your efficiency. Uh, oh, yeah.  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show."
"Plankton"," Drat."
"Plankton"," Okay, okay. I will.  I bid you good day, sir."
"Mr. Krabs"," You gotta swallow it here on the premises."
"Plankton"," Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene, want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket."
"SpongeBob"," Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today?"
"Patrick","  ♪I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And then we'll have Christmas all year long!♪ Hey, a cookie! "
"SpongeBob"," ♪Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee!  And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?♪"
"Sandy"," ♪Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas is sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.♪"
"SpongeBob"," Don't you mean the season of giving?"
"Plankton"," ♪Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!♪ "
"SpongeBob"," Mm-mm."
"SpongeBob"," No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer? "
"Plankton"," Grrr! Have some more!  Have a whole loaf!  Have a baker's dozen!  Well?"
"SpongeBob"," What's that all about?  Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?"
"Squidward"," Why don't you go bother Sandy?"
"SpongeBob"," Is that all you got?"
"Squidward","  I beg to differ. I mean, just look at this place!  It's disgusting, not to mention our cheap boss!"
"Mr. Krabs","   See you fellows tomorrow! Gourmet know-how! "
"Squidward"," Laugh it up! My knowledge and intelligence could make even the Chum Bucket a success! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't value you at all! "
"Squidward"," I'll do it. "
"Squidward"," Oh, I'm sorry! Remind me, who's in complete creative control here?"
"Squidward"," See, Plankton, there's a trick to making chum edible.  We just have to follow old Grandma Tentacles's secret fricassee recipe."
"Plankton"," Who took my blue blanky? Huh? This is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising."
"Mr. Krabs"," Sooo, we're having a slow day. At least Old Jethra has stuck with us. That Krabby Patty hitting the spot, Jethra?"
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Good evening, Madam. Table for two, please?"
"Squidward"," Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!"
"Plankton"," My restaurant! "
"SpongeBob","  Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all."
"Mr. Krabs"," Gotcha! Whoa! You're a big one! Can't believe I've never seen you in the Krusty Krab before!"
"SpongeBob"," I haven't seen Mr. Krabs all morning. Do you know where he is?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've been conducting a little research! Where's Squidward?"
"Squidward","  Present!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, wow! You've been busy, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," How about you, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," I try not to look directly at the customers."
"SpongeBob"," When I see that 2%, I think of pie!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Over-what who?"
"Squidward","  Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs! I'll get right on that, never."
"SpongeBob"," Hello, Bottomites!  Hello, sir! Have you ever heard of the most wonderful restaurant in all of Bikini Bottom, the Krusty Krab?"
"Patrick"," Oh, no! I knew this day would come! Invasion of the Giant Patties! There's only one thing to do! It's eat or be eaten!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick! What are you doing? It's me, SpongeBob!"
"Patrick"," You okay, little buddy?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, I guess... so."
"Patrick"," Whatever!"
"SpongeBob","  That tickles!"
"Patrick"," Ok, now turn around! Open wide!  Wider!  Perfect!  Ready?"
"SpongeBob","  Ready!"
"Patrick"," Ooh, the Krusty Krab! "
"SpongeBob"," Phew!"
"Patrick","  I got this! "
"Plankton","  99 feet!"
"Mr. Krabs","  It's true."
"Plankton","  You are moving!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ohoho! No, you are!"
"SpongeBob"," I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Thanks for saving me shell, boy!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!"
"Plankton","   Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need!  I got the signatures!  All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon.  But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need."
"Mr. Krabs","  It's time. "
"Mr. Krabs"," If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant,  it's gonna be long and painful!"
"SpongeBob","  Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, dear. "
"Squidward"," And who might you be?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Mornin' Squidward!  Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find..."
"Patrick"," Then what about this? "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Look! It's Ned and the Needlefish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!"
"Squidward"," A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four!  Thank you! Thank you very much!  Oh come on! Nothing!?"
"Mr. Krabs"," What's this? Our pay check?"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life Squidward?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh the crowd went wild sir!"
"Squidward"," No no! Wait! Let me guess You ate the spare tire?"
"Patrick"," Wow...you're good at guessing..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, why didn't you just ask me?  You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually.  Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!"
"SpongeBob"," Wait! Squidward! Squidward! You can't go! Please! Don't you see? The Krusty Krab needs us more than ever!"
"SpongeBob"," ♪Squidward...you must look inward. And then I'm sure that you will see what an awesome band we still could be! Please! Oh please don't quit on us now! I cannot allow this to be our last bow! Now now now! No no no! Nay nay nay! Neh neh neh! NEEEEVER give up! Don't ever give up! We can't let Mr. Krabs go bankrupt! We must keep busy! Never giving up!♪"
"SpongeBob"," ♪This is the part where I stand up and play!♪"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why'd I owe you money for!?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well Krusty Krab, this is good bye... WHY!? WHY!?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm ready!"
"Plankton","  Hello sir! I'd like to purchase the Krusty Krab restaurant you have in your...where is it?"
"Patrick","  A bit dry and flavorless. I'll take two dozen."
"Patrick"," Hey! How'd we get up here? "
"SpongeBob"," Explosive, huh? I know just the thing!  Boom!  Impressed?"
"Patrick"," I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around.  Oohh...We give up! Fling  That was close."
"Patrick"," Even more brutal!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold tight, Sandy."
"Sandy"," ...108, 109, 110!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can."
"Sandy"," Chum, huh? That's not too bad."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, Sandy, eat up."
"Sandy"," Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh...  must make world record!"
"SpongeBob"," I'll go get the camera."
"Sandy"," Well, hurry up! I got record breaking to do!"
"SpongeBob"," Say ""cheese""!"
"Sandy"," Cheese!  Picture!"
"Sandy"," Woohoo! What's next?"
"Patrick"," What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!"
"Squidward"," Where? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?"
"Squidward"," Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?"
"Patrick"," No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere! "
"Patrick"," Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!"
"Patrick"," Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!"
"Patrick"," Admit it, masked marauder!"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff! "
"Patrick"," I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! "
"Patrick"," Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work."
"SpongeBob"," I'm beginning to sense a pattern here.  Gary, are you trying to tell me something? Could it be that what you need is a new chew toy?  I thought so.  "
"Patrick"," It's so futuristic.  Look, a red dot!  Come back here!"
"SpongeBob"," That's brilliant! What will they think of next?"
"SpongeBob"," Are you ready to play with your new ball?  Here it is, boy! "
"SpongeBob"," OK, Gary, bring it back!  C'mon, Gary, bring it back.  You're supposed to bring it … back … Ah well, as long as he's not chewing on my stuff.   I wonder how Gary's doing? I haven't heard a squeak out of him.  Gary? Hmm, where is that snail? Gary, where are you?  Gary, I- oh, there you are!  Oh, a tea party, cute! Do you mind if I join you? I just love a spot of tea.  What kind of tea is it? Green tea? Earl gray? Oolong? Slippery elm?  Gee, I think he likes that ball more than me.  Deugh! That is not tea."
"SpongeBob"," Good morning, Gary! I hope you're not still mad at me. Gary? The ball!  I will not tolerate this disobedience, Gary!  Gary, I'm not playing around, you had better show yourself this instant. OK, get down here! Hm.  Gary, give me that ball.  C'mon! Hnn! Get down!  Mother always said, “don't run with the broom”. I'll take that!  Gary, how could you! You are going to have to make a choice. It's either me, or the-  Ball. Fine. I hope you two will be very happy. Together. Without me. Goodbye. "
"Mr. Krabs","  There you are boy!  The Milkshake Academy! You know boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!"
"SpongeBob"," What's wrong Captain Frostymug?"
"SpongeBob"," No! I'm not leaving you behind! "
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh. Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes  me back. "
"Patrick"," Hey, He's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. He should probably see a doctor. Come on let's take him to the hospital."
"Patrick"," Hey little Squidward. Ready to have some fun? Woop-ee-doo! "
"SpongeBob"," Ok Squidie! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle?  Patrick how could you!  There! My little darling. Were supposed to protect his head remember?  Ok Squidie! I made your favorite. Grilled Tar Tar with a algae vinaigrette.  Here it comes, open wide!  Come on little buddy you got eat healthy so you can grow up to be big and cranky. Just like the airplane in the hanger.  See Patrick sometimes you have to out-think the baby.  You know Patrick maybe..."
"Patrick"," He does. "
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, This game's kinda dangerous. "
"Patrick"," Don't worry he'll be settled down in couple of minutes. "
"SpongeBob"," Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!"
"Mr. Krabs"," What in blazes is going on around he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward!  Where are your manners?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! Yes, sir!  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," Sorry!  Ok, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes."
"SpongeBob","  Nothing."
"Squidward"," Hmmm.  If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it. "
"Squidward"," The address is on the bag."
"SpongeBob"," P-p-p-p-plaid? "
"Squidward","  Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula ""Fifi."""
"SpongeBob"," My... DIARY! Squidward! How could you?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize."
"Squidward","  He'll get over it. "
"SpongeBob"," What for?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
"SpongeBob","  Ward!"
"SpongeBob","  Sea urchin! Geh..."
"SpongeBob"," There it is!  I'll get it!  Got it! "
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry Plankton! We're behind you one hundred percent!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, who cares about Plankton? What about me restaurant?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here goes nothing! "
"SpongeBob","  So where do we release them?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Keep going!"
"SpongeBob"," Is this far enough?"
"Squidward"," Paranoid much?"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up! "
"Squidward"," About the danger that lurks around every corner! "
"SpongeBob"," Eh, don't you mean ""karate?"""
"SpongeBob"," Play close attention and you will receive the totality of my karate mastery! Handed down from Sensei Cheeks herself. Now watch! Watch and learn. "
"Squidward"," -Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?"
"Sandy"," Great! Now repeat after me HIYAH!"
"Squidward"," Sigh...whatever you say Sensei..."
"Sandy"," Arms up Squidward! Block! Block!  Block! Block!"
"SpongeBob"," Come on, Squiddy! Give it the ol' roundhouse!"
"Squidward"," Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah!  Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH!  Got you... right where...I want you!  Vengeance... is... MINE!"
"Squidward"," Shut up! Phew! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey Sandy?  I don't remember this being a part of my training."
"Sandy"," It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet! "
"Squidward"," Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!"
"Sandy"," Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of...  ...the Belt of Basic Competence!"
"Squidward"," Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store!  Hee-YAH!  HEE-YAH!  Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows!  Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you!  Okay buddy, I warned ya!  I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH! "
"Squidward"," My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH! "
"SpongeBob"," Psst! Hey, Sheldon!"
"SpongeBob","  Hi Karen!  Look Plankton! Karen came to visit and she brought you a cake! "
"Plankton"," Wait a second! I didn't say you could-"
"Plankton","  Wait! Put me down!  Uh oh... You can't eat me! I'm Bikini Bottom's most evil genius!"
"Plankton"," Are we at the airport?  Ahem! Hey! Gather 'round fellow convicts! It is I the one and only Sheldon J. Plankton, evil genius!"
"Plankton","  With this pack of criminals, I can steal the Secret Formula like that!"
"Plankton"," Chum? What use is chum?"
"Plankton","  Uh oh... It worked! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry SpongeBob! We're ready for 'em!"
"SpongeBob"," Is it toxic patty Tuesday?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hold on, kiddo. We still have one more ingredient. "
"SpongeBob"," Got it. Two drops... "
"Mr. Krabs"," We can get it later."
"SpongeBob"," Well, I've never even heard of that model."
"Plankton"," These are nothing compared to......the majestic SizzleMaster! "
"Mr. Krabs"," You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh! "
"SpongeBob","  Well, nothing me and the SizzleMaster can't handle."
"SpongeBob","  I wasn't talking to my spatula!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! That's a great idea! But you man the condiments, I'll take the grill. Sorry, but I don't trust anyone with this baby, but me."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, that's great SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas? Only do it if it makes me money. "
"SpongeBob","  Unlikely. But a spatula can dream. See you tomorrow."
"Plankton","  Sure!"
"Plankton","   Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula! "
"Plankton","  Would you like me to man the grill for you today?"
"Plankton","  Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone."
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so?  Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe. "
"SpongeBob"," Aye, aye! Okay SizzleMaster, the first ingredient is... five gallons combustible cooking oil."
"Plankton"," Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm,  beach-goers should be famished  and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people!  Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! "
"Sandy"," O-kay...  ""BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR"" . The visual is of a normal undersea background] My scientific investigation has  revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo.  A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable. At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!"
"Plankton"," That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. "
"Patrick","  Seems safe to me."
"Plankton","  I can't find this thing anywhere.  Come on, now. Think, Plankton.  If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? "
"Plankton"," What did you say?"
"Sandy"," Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to--  --run like heck! "
"Sandy","  Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!"
"SpongeBob"," That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own."
"Sandy"," Or the mind of someone else. Look!  Plankton! I knew it!"
"Plankton"," Yeah, it's me."
"Sandy"," Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!"
"Plankton"," Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! "
"Sandy"," We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!"
"Plankton"," Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second--  No, you don't! "
"Patrick","  Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, good thing. "
"Sandy"," Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub!  My sub!"
"Patrick"," Really?  Do I need deodorant?"
"SpongeBob"," No, but you're close. What we need is  liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!"
"SpongeBob"," Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! "
"Patrick","  Whoo!  Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser!  Whoo!  You're the man! Yay! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Ok, I'll do it."
"SpongeBob","  See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything! "
"Mr. Krabs"," ""Instant interest""?! Well, that's practically giving money away!  SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough!  Money, here I co... Huh? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Good day, gentlemen!"
"Mr. Krabs","  They haven't thrown me out yet..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, of course!  Here's me prized penny deposit it into a new account!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait! Can it...have one moment with me penny? Alone?"
"SpongeBob"," I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him!  Hold on, Krabs! I'm coming for ya!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! "
"SpongeBob"," I know!"
"Patrick"," Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this? "
"SpongeBob"," A bunch of old shoelaces?"
"Patrick"," Let's get him!  COOL! Let's do that again!"
"SpongeBob"," Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen."
"Patrick"," Oh, right!  I'll use the finesse. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit!  Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest!  Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. "
"SpongeBob"," That's okay. I'll tell you."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys."
"Squidward"," "
"SpongeBob"," Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie. "
"SpongeBob"," Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! "
"SpongeBob"," The Fisherman's got him!"
"Patrick"," You sure?  It's worse!  They're kissing!"
"SpongeBob"," Must close eyes! Too scary!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow. Uh, what time is it?"
"SpongeBob"," Phew. We made it."
"Patrick"," Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?"
"SpongeBob"," No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. "
"Patrick"," Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. "
"SpongeBob"," Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah. Here. "
"Patrick"," Yeah., goodnight! Just don't think about the Fisherman!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!"
"SpongeBob"," Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!"
"Patrick"," Oh. The Fisherman's here."
"SpongeBob"," The Fisherman!"
"SpongeBob","  Get everything?"
"Patrick"," Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away."
"SpongeBob"," Oh yeah. Just like the movie. "
"Squidward"," Well, try to contain yourself. We have a customer."
"Patrick"," Then can we eat some furniture?"
"SpongeBob"," No."
"SpongeBob"," Rusty Rickets!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh right. You're a ghost. Hmm... how about you just show me how to make one?"
"SpongeBob"," Spackle, shellac."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! I didn't summon you guys!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Looks like a certain foolish sponge has been conversin' with the unliving! All right you floating nuisances! Time for the bossman to mop up!  Batter up! H'ya!  Yeah, and go back in which ye came! "
"SpongeBob"," Order up! Here's your #9 sir! "
"Squidward"," SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Patties and less heavy breathing?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day."
"Patrick"," No."
"SpongeBob","  Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. "
"Patrick","  Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird."
"SpongeBob"," But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo. "
"SpongeBob"," Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.  Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign!  Swoon! Swoon! "
"Mr. Krabs"," All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? "
"Mr. Krabs"," No! Come back!  Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  What is your problem?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!"
"Squidward"," SpongeBob's got that covered."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!"
"Squidward"," Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another."
"Squidward"," It doesn't matter what you ""want"" me to do, I won't do it!"
"SpongeBob","  Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward and I are as close as brothers!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!"
"SpongeBob"," You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay. "
"Squidward","  What? What? What? Wha... huh?"
"Squidward","  I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?"
"Squidward"," Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!"
"Squidward","  Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody! "
"Mr. Krabs"," We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me."
"SpongeBob"," Done!"
"SpongeBob","  Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?"
"Mr. Krabs","  You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times ""golden spatula"" in the navy,  so I'll be runnin' the grill.  Ooh!"
"Squidward"," I can smell the grease fires already."
"Patrick"," That's the spirit!  Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward.  Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning? "
"Sandy"," Okay, let's begin the experiment.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, next."
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job."
"SpongeBob","  Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment."
"SpongeBob"," Your weenies, sir. "
"SpongeBob"," I mean, Mr. Wiener!"
"SpongeBob","  Eh... probably. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, of deliciousness!"
"SpongeBob","  How about that?"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob","  I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?"
"SpongeBob"," What?  Parmesan-crusted breadstick!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob","  Squidward?"
"SpongeBob","  Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward"," Whatever."
"Squidward"," Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!"
"Squidward"," Well, see, you have point A , where you start, and then there's point...  point... I don't even know what I'm talking about!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause."
"SpongeBob"," Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money!  Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came...  I'M LOST!  Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant!  Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant!  So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out.  Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone.  Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it.  My last dime.  I hope this works. "
"SpongeBob"," I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?"
"SpongeBob"," What ya doing there, drinking soda?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! "
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!"
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a...  ""professional"" to teach you how to drive."
"SpongeBob","  It is?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time."
"SpongeBob"," I do?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick's house! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Upsell!"
"Squidward","   Would you like fries with that?"
"Mr. Krabs","  A simple trip to Patrick's house a line so straight and true."
"Mr. Krabs"," Saw that coming."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. "
"SpongeBob","  Uh, yeah, some of it."
"Mr. Krabs","  Not really."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! What could be worse than spending money? "
"SpongeBob","  Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes."
"Squidward"," I'm busy."
"Squidward"," What's ""busy busy?"""
"SpongeBob","  I found a jump rope!"
"Squidward"," Plus one! Oh yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?"
"Squidward"," Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  TONIGHT?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?"
"SpongeBob"," Yes? I'm still here."
"Squidward"," We make quite a team!"
"Squidward"," Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?"
"Squidward"," So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?"
"Squidward"," Just get me out of here!"
"Squidward"," Come on, SpongeBob."
"Patrick","  Yes! "
"Squidward","  I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files. "
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you.  You can’t fire me! I’m not an executive at all! I’m just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say! "
"Patrick"," Yeah. Well, it’s pretty nice I guess."
"SpongeBob"," You know what that makes you?"
"SpongeBob"," Maybe Pete is just tired."
"Mr. Krabs","  No! Not his productivity!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yes, yes it is."
"Mr. Krabs"," Right you are! Here's the food! "
"Squidward","  What?"
"Mr. Krabs","  ""The greatest company picnic ever!"""
"Plankton"," Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic."
"Plankton"," Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities."
"Squidward"," Delicacies?"
"SpongeBob","  You want me to paint your face?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad."
"Mr. Krabs"," Are you sure you don't want to?"
"SpongeBob"," 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," It's a paper plate. Whoo! "
"SpongeBob","  Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!"
"SpongeBob"," I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs."
"Plankton"," Uh oh."
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  Chafed, Mr. Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me!  Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?"
"Squidward"," What are we all winking about?"
"SpongeBob","  Ah, I tell you Gary, there is nothing better on a sunny day than a fresh walk."
"Patrick"," Huh. Well, what about those baby snails?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh?"
"SpongeBob"," Donnie."
"SpongeBob"," Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Donnie, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob, is that you?"
"Squidward"," One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!"
"Squidward","  Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?"
"Squidward","  Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!"
"SpongeBob"," So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Señor Poopus.  I mean Señorita Esmerelda."
"Patrick"," Bye, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Bye, Patrick."
"SpongeBob"," But just look at him go!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Nope, it's good as that. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators!. I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it. "
"Patrick"," I isn't Patrick?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!"
"Patrick"," Oh, why didn't you say so. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!"
"SpongeBob"," His taxes?"
"Patrick"," I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings. "
"Mr. Krabs"," What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!"
"Patrick"," I don't get it! What's an audit?"
"SpongeBob"," I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!"
"Squidward"," Whoopee. Do tell."
"Patrick"," Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?"
"Squidward"," O?"
"Patrick"," Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, ""Tic-Tac""!.  You start!"
"Patrick"," Squidward, I got a new game! It's called ""Rock, Paper, Butter""!"
"Patrick"," And so it begins."
"Sandy"," What's it called, Patrick?"
"Squidward","  Both!"
"Patrick"," Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game."
"Patrick"," Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, play by the rules."
"Sandy"," Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit."
"Squidward"," Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!"
"Squidward"," Oh boy! Snacks!"
"Patrick"," Jail for Squidward!"
"Squidward","  Okay, I'm going outside."
"Patrick","  If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside."
"Squidward"," Somebody say my name!"
"Patrick"," Game over!"
"Squidward"," Well, why don't you clean the... uh... "
"Squidward"," Two more times."
"SpongeBob"," I hear and obey my liege."
"SpongeBob"," You ordered me to!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh! I like that!"
"Squidward"," Alright, you've been down here longer than me. Which way?"
"SpongeBob"," That way."
"Squidward"," Looks like snakes."
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Over there!"
"Squidward"," There it is!"
"Squidward"," Where? Where?"
"SpongeBob","  O Sole Mio."
"Squidward"," Just my luck."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hmm. Is that bad?"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?"
"SpongeBob"," What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You should be the maitre' d! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!"
"SpongeBob"," No, merely a man, a man in longpants.  Oh, my precious longpants!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place. "
"SpongeBob","  AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour! "
"SpongeBob"," Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment!   Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae."
"SpongeBob"," 'Oh,  SpongeRobert."
"SpongeBob","  Well, were's all the party hats, where's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?"
"SpongeBob"," My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaidman movie!"
"Sandy"," That-a-boy! I got you a ticket just in case!"
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, for Pete's sake.  Sorry 'bout the legs boyo."
"SpongeBob"," Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work."
"Mr. Krabs"," You said everything was free."
"SpongeBob","  Squishy."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!"
"Squidward"," What are you... Whoa! You've been working out."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt."
"SpongeBob","  Walk on your back."
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker."
"SpongeBob"," You wanted to see me, sir?"
"SpongeBob"," Larry, your brug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what a great day."
"Mr. Krabs"," I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?"
"Sandy"," Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?"
"Patrick"," I knew it!"
"Sandy"," Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?"
"Patrick"," Oh! It's like a dream!"
"Patrick","  I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge."
"SpongeBob"," So, what's it gonna be boss?"
"Patrick"," Uh. Huh? What?"
"SpongeBob"," Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven."
"Patrick"," Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha."
"Squidward"," One free ice cream, please?"
"Patrick"," Well, I wanna trade back!"
"Sandy"," Here ya go!"
"Patrick"," Who's in charge?"
"SpongeBob"," Alright, I'll rub your feet."
"SpongeBob"," One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three."
"Patrick"," Yes I am."
"SpongeBob"," Would you like sprinkles on it?"
"Sandy"," Everybody gets an A+ and ice cream!"
"Squidward"," What is going on?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Ooh, careful now, careful.  Your ink will run."
"Mr. Krabs","  The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs.  And yours?"
"Plankton","  ...just as I planned. "
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, no, no!  I was, uh...  I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see.  Like this!  Right, hmm... "
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, she's...  ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman."
"Plankton","  Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk...  Ah. Girls like shoes."
"Mr. Krabs"," Let me talk to her."
"Mr. Krabs","  Cashina, you know I love ya.  And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Great!  Here's your budget."
"Patrick","  Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!"
"SpongeBob"," Would you like our house red or or house yellow? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask."
"Plankton"," Oh boy, here it comes!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Alright, me sweet. Here it is.  Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before.  So, here goes.  Erngh. "
"Plankton"," You're not gonna crush me?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?"
"Mr. Krabs","  I have no idea, Pearly."
"Patrick"," Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot!"
"SpongeBob"," Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great! "
"SpongeBob"," Flipping."
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir! "
"SpongeBob","  Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, guy. Way to wait. "
"SpongeBob"," But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days."
"SpongeBob"," No! I can do it. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now where's me new fry cook?"
"Patrick"," Uh, sorry, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?"
"Sandy","  SpongeBob! It's me, Sandy!  Hey SpongeBob! I haven't seen you in days, whatcha doin'?"
"SpongeBob"," And what might that be?"
"Sandy","  I don't know SpongeBob! That's a question you have to answer for yourself. "
"Patrick"," The job's taken."
"SpongeBob"," Well I'm taking it back."
"Patrick"," Admit it! You have been bested!"
"SpongeBob"," Never! "
"SpongeBob"," La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"SpongeBob"," Well, goodnight Krusty Krab. "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, but what if they're hurt?"
"SpongeBob","  That guy seemed really scared of us."
"SpongeBob"," Well I'm glad that's all cleared up."
"SpongeBob"," I'm ready!"
"Squidward"," What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe. "
"Squidward"," Oh brother."
"Squidward"," Will you stop yapping already?"
"Squidward"," I didn't win anything."
"SpongeBob"," You know Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!"
"SpongeBob"," "
"SpongeBob"," Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!"
"Plankton"," What are you doing here!? You said you would take today off."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. "
"Squidward"," I said ""Whatever.""  Wait, didn't I just... Didn't I..."
"Squidward"," If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything!  I really am dreaming! "
"Plankton"," Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?"
"Plankton"," And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Under where?"
"Squidward"," That's right.  ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! "
"SpongeBob","  Looks like you sponges have everything covered."
"SpongeBob"," Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula."
"Plankton"," It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!"
"Plankton"," What's the formula?! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here."
"Plankton"," You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway."
"Plankton"," Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!"
"SpongeBob"," Well, we might as well spend the night here. It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!"
"Squidward"," Good morning, SpongeBob!  Oh, that's why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob."
"Patrick","  Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward"," Oh, listen you dumb--  Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that! "
"Squidward"," Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed."
"Squidward"," No, no, no, uh, a band lives there now!"
"Patrick"," A rock band?"
"SpongeBob"," Ach! Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob"," Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home."
"Squidward","  She's shy... well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!"
"Squidward"," Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments."
"Patrick"," What do you play?"
"Squidward"," I'll be right back! "
"Squidward"," One--  One second!  Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!"
"Squidward","  That's it, I'm done! "
"Squidward"," He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!"
"Patrick"," He flips houses for a living?"
"SpongeBob"," You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary! It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and—"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one. "
"Squidward"," Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!"
"Squidward","  Hooray. "
"Plankton"," Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!"
"Mr. Krabs","  J-just how true are these cookie fortunes SpongeBob?"
"Plankton"," I guess I didn't really think that through."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I figured the funeral fortune was phony Plankton."
"Patrick"," It's harder to walk, but worth it."
"SpongeBob"," Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day buying ourselves the perfect ice cream."
"Mr. Krabs","  ""Lonely Krab Dinner for One Now 30% lonelier."" Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient."
"Mr. Krabs","  Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired."
"Squidward"," Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?"
"Patrick","  Aww."
"SpongeBob"," I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off."
"Patrick","  ""Tastes so nice that they—"""
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!"
"Plankton"," Now to make my escape."
"SpongeBob"," Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop."
"Plankton"," Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?"
"Patrick"," SpongeBob! "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!"
"Patrick"," But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? "
"SpongeBob"," Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help."
"SpongeBob"," Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?"
"Patrick"," Yeah, we just give them away."
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Sandy"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?"
"Patrick"," Okay. Hmm. "
"Sandy"," "
"Sandy"," I love squirreling away nuts, but this is just too much!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa. Who are you?"
"SpongeBob"," Meant to be eatin' eh?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham."
"Sandy"," Shertainly not! I mean certainly not!  Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make."
"Sandy"," Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?"
"Patrick"," Thanks, Sandy!"
"Patrick"," Oh.  They licked the Nutty Butter off my back.  And now they're here for more."
"Patrick"," Uh huh."
"Sandy"," SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt.  Then the tubes take them inside  where I turn them into Nutty Butter."
"SpongeBob"," Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick."
"Patrick"," And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!"
"Sandy"," Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?"
"Sandy"," Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends."
"SpongeBob","  Community!"
"Patrick","  Hello!"
"SpongeBob"," Now it's smaller than that one!"
"Squidward"," Oh, he responded hours ago."
"Mr. Krabs"," How about some paper?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?"
"Squidward","  I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!"
"Squidward"," I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!"
"Squidward"," Or we could push him off a cliff."
"SpongeBob"," We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!"
"Squidward","  I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!"
"SpongeBob"," So that's what happens to the ketchup stains."
"Mr. Krabs","  I'll tear ya to pieces!"
"Patrick"," Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way."
"SpongeBob"," So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth."
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower."
"Squidward","  Oh, ratfish!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No, that's today! Tomorrow is Food Con!"
"Mr. Krabs"," As you can see gentlemen, I have spared no expense on our transportation! "
"SpongeBob"," Woo!"
"Mr. Krabs","  And I brought plenty of free samples to sell!"
"SpongeBob","  I spy with my little eye..."
"Patrick"," Oh ho! Yes! Yes!"
"SpongeBob"," I spy with my little eye..."
"Mr. Krabs","  Enough!! You both are barnacles on me brain!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Squidward"," If I do, will you promise to stop?"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs?  Blink if you're alive."
"SpongeBob"," We must guard this last patty with our very lives! It's the only way to win Food Con! And who knows what scary, hungry things are out there in the woods waiting to gobble it up!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, you've saved the Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Oh boy!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I think mine is mostly stones!"
"SpongeBob"," Mr. Krabs, remember Food Con!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Well, in that case, you leave me no choice. Get him!!!"
"Patrick"," Hunger!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Shh! Shh! I hear him over there! He's arguing with the patty! Get him!"
"SpongeBob"," Ohh!"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, my pen pal thinks I can fly!"
"SpongeBob"," ""Dearest Pen Pal, yes, I can fly! Boy, do I love flying! Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!"""
"SpongeBob"," I did a bad thing, Sandy! I did a very bad thing!"
"Sandy"," Here. Take these. They're clean."
"SpongeBob"," Did I do it?"
"Sandy"," Hmm. Good enough."
"SpongeBob"," I just wanted to say that today... Today...  ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you."" Oh, I will not let you down."
"Sandy"," Get outta here, Steve!"
"Patrick"," Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, it was my pleasure."
"Plankton"," That formula will be mine!"
"SpongeBob"," Not the patties! I'll save you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know. Me eyes were burnin'! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  Plankton!  He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it!  He could be reading it!"
"Plankton"," What? The old safe in the safe routine?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, sir. I see the problem."
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddie."
"Plankton","  Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there! "
"Plankton"," Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place."
"Plankton"," My leg!"
"Plankton"," Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere."
"Plankton"," Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!"
"SpongeBob"," What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?"
"Plankton"," I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!"
"Plankton"," One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it."
"Sandy"," I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones."
"Sandy"," What in Sam Hill?"
"Sandy"," Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up all you morons! Classes are now beginning!"
"Sandy"," And don't forget your last homework assignment!"
"Plankton"," Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!"
"Plankton"," Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!"
"Patrick"," Uh, hey. No running in the halls!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Calm your waters.  Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, while I steer you tell everyone we're safe."
"SpongeBob"," He also created the Chatty Patty for teens. And who can forget the Hatty Patty. The patty you wear as a hat."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa! Man overboard! "
"SpongeBob"," I know you'll come back to us, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoa! Where are we?"
"SpongeBob"," Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them."
"SpongeBob"," We're begging you! Please!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! You lose!"
"SpongeBob","  Spend it."
"Mr. Krabs"," I can't hear you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Wait a minute! Gimme that!"
"Patrick"," Aww, darn it."
"SpongeBob"," Oh boy! Aren't dentist offices fun?  Oh, they've got colorful wooden beads on wires!  Whoa, look at it go!"
"Patrick","  That's not right!"
"Patrick"," Tooth Island?"
"SpongeBob"," Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows."
"Patrick"," ♪Rock a bye baby on the treetop♪"
"Patrick"," Ow!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says, ""If you can't bite, things ain't right."""
"Squidward"," It's all a bunch of made up baloney."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy."
"Patrick"," A likely story!"
"SpongeBob","  Patrick, can I show you something?"
"Patrick"," You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!"
"Squidward"," Oh, that's a good one."
"Patrick"," There really is a Tooth Ferry!"
"SpongeBob"," Of course."
"Patrick"," Now you. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick"," No, I want it!"
"SpongeBob"," No, I want it!"
"Patrick"," Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Oh! "
"SpongeBob"," Now, you do me!"
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?"
"Squidward","  The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can...  let it all hang out.  Me... "
"Patrick"," I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!"
"Patrick"," Get ready, get set, punch it!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!"
"Patrick","  M-O-O-N.  That spells moon! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!"
"Patrick"," Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob"," I've found mine too!"
"Patrick"," I'll take it!"
"Sandy"," This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in..."
"Sandy"," Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!"
"SpongeBob"," Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again! "
"Sandy"," Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll..."
"SpongeBob"," Doctor Negative!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, Squidward, do you hear that? You'd better hurry up or you'll be late for work."
"SpongeBob"," Of the first variety."
"SpongeBob"," Alright, Doctor Negative. We'll play along and take it out. Hiya!"
"Squidward"," Hmm?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood."
"Squidward"," Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on."
"Mr. Krabs"," Squidward!"
"Squidward","  And cower in fear of Doctor Negative."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha! See? I just stole some money!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card."
"SpongeBob"," Boink!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, wha... what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," See? I just knew we'd make a terrific bad guy. He is really committing."
"Patrick"," Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!"
"SpongeBob"," What are you saying?"
"SpongeBob"," I already did. Here, I'll turn it back on just for you."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Squidward, that makes no sense. Who ever heard of dust making you sneeze?"
"Squidward"," Gary, no, no, no, no! "
"Squidward"," You okay in there, SpongeBob? "
"Squidward"," Yes. You can't stay here or your allergy will just get worse.  Hey, look at that."
"Squidward"," This would make a great new house, what do you think?"
"Squidward"," How about this spicy number?"
"Squidward"," I mean, don't worry about it. It's a short 11-hour commute to the Krusty Krab from here."
"Squidward"," This place is amazing.  It's like living in the future."
"SpongeBob"," Wait, what?"
"Squidward"," Great, it's a done deal. So if you don't mind, I have a lot of settling in to do.  Bye-bye."
"SpongeBob","  Doink! Now this really feels like home."
"Squidward"," Okay, fine, I'll just take your old pineapple. Huh? "
"Patrick"," Sorry, Squidward, but this is my house now. "
"SpongeBob"," Whatcha doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Aww, come on, Squidward.  I can get you there lickety-split."
"SpongeBob"," Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home."
"SpongeBob"," Fluff your pillow?"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too."
"SpongeBob"," Ah-ha!  Mmm, sushi."
"SpongeBob"," Ta-da!"
"SpongeBob"," There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse."
"Mr. Krabs"," I heard that, Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward"," It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was a—a—a—a tribute. Haven't you ever heard of ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery""?"
"Squidward"," Already forgot about it."
"Squidward"," Hurry up, SpongeBob, I need two orders of Krabby Krust stat."
"SpongeBob","  Or never, whichever comes first."
"Mr. Krabs"," Spread out! All right, you scurvy dogs, SpongeBob needs us, and more importantly, I need him—to stop imitating me customers!"
"SpongeBob","  Hi! Ahoy! Howdy! Greetings! Go away!"
"SpongeBob","  I'm-a trying, Sandy, I'm-a trying!"
"Sandy"," You can do it, SpongeBob, just concentrate, and it'll all come back to ya!"
"Sandy","   I know you're in there somewhere, SquarePants!"
"Patrick","  Mmm! Mmm!"
"Plankton","  Thanks."
"SpongeBob"," Thanks, guys, you're the best friends a guy with memory loss could have. It sure feels great to just be yourself. Doesn't it, guys? Guys?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, there's something inside of me."
"SpongeBob","  I see you!"
"SpongeBob"," Nighty-night, Prickles."
"SpongeBob"," Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! "
"SpongeBob","  ""Squatters rights?"" What the heck is squatters rights?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy ""condisherin'."""
"Plankton"," Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties."
"Plankton","  You're on your own, worm boy."
"SpongeBob"," Well, this is my life from now on, huh?  Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms. "
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! I need a hug!"
"Squidward"," Taking a walk... walk... walk. "
"SpongeBob"," Aww."
"Patrick"," Okay."
"Patrick","  Wow, you sound more like him than—than Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," All right, Patrick, we've got a date at the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic. Let's get going."
"Patrick"," Me neither, SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering? "
"Squidward"," Okay, I'm going in."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piñata, son."
"Squidward"," We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!"
"Patrick"," They tore off my head."
"SpongeBob"," Maybe we should make a break for it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs"," Come on, men, let's cheese it!"
"SpongeBob"," No!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Yes. "
"Mr. Krabs"," You."
"Squidward"," Hey, what are you—"
"Mr. Krabs","  We are anything we need to be for me to make this money."
"Squidward"," Here you go, princess."
"Mr. Krabs"," Um, yes, ma'am?"
"Patrick"," Mine, mine!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Barrel roll, four somersaults!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Oh, no."
"Mr. Krabs","  Everyone seems to really like the Krabby Patty!"
"Squidward","  Some people started calling it the ""SpongeBob Patty!"""
"Mr. Krabs"," "
"Squidward"," "
"Squidward"," Haunted, eh?"
"SpongeBob"," What's that, Squidward? 30 Krabby Patties? Coming right up! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Now go ahead! Call attention to me!"
"Squidward","  Hey, everybody! Look who's back in the kitchen!"
"Mr. Krabs","  Is everybody enjoying their Krabby Patties? "
"Mr. Krabs"," Ahh! Ow! Eee! Hey! Oh! Whoa! Ah! Blazes!"
"Squidward"," G'night, boss! See you in the morning! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," You know, I know of an empty restaurant that's got all its papers in order. We can move in right away."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mr. Squidward!"
"Squidward","  And...uh...oh..."
"SpongeBob"," I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. It looks the same."
"Mr. Krabs"," Under the words, ""Krusty Krab!"""
"SpongeBob"," Suit yourself."
"Plankton"," Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom."
"Plankton"," Oh, forget this!"
"Plankton"," Hey! What? Get off! Get—Oh!  Oh, that's the spot."
"Plankton"," Me, aggressive?! How dare you?!  Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person!  I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?"
"Patrick"," Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!"
"Plankton","  After you."
"Patrick"," Ahh!"
"SpongeBob"," Plankton, no!"
"SpongeBob"," No, try again."
"Plankton"," It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart. "
"SpongeBob"," Thank you!  Ow!  I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!"
"Plankton","  This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!"
"SpongeBob"," You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies. "
"Squidward"," Stop, stop, stop! I thought you said you were trying to hurt each other!"
"Squidward"," I said... "
"SpongeBob"," Gee, Squidward,  maybe you should get some life insurance."
"Patrick","  Actually, you better take two, since you kind of a klutz. "
"SpongeBob"," You are magically protected."
"Squidward"," Look, I'll prove it. You stand here."
"SpongeBob"," What you gonna do, Squidward?"
"Squidward"," Did you see that? I ran right through a brick wall. I'm hard as nails! Come on, world! Bring it on! "
"Squidward"," Ha! Germs can't hurt me. Nothing can hurt me!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah!"
"SpongeBob"," Yes, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts."
"Patrick"," Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now."
"SpongeBob"," Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later. "
"SpongeBob"," Gary!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?"
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it, Larry!"
"SpongeBob"," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? "
"Mr. Krabs","  Gotcha! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Gotcha! "
"SpongeBob"," ""Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring..."""
"Plankton"," A new life in a new town! "
"SpongeBob","  Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick."
"Mr. Krabs"," Now that I sees it, I believes it."
"Plankton"," In your face, Krabs! Ha!"
"SpongeBob","  Hello? Krusty Krab, may I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back.  Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps."
"Squidward"," Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead!  Hey, who's responsible for this? "
"SpongeBob"," I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!"
"SpongeBob"," 37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties?  Huh, has my spatula always had three heads? "
"SpongeBob","  Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs!  I'm trying!  Come on, you, work!"
"Mr. Krabs"," No! This is gonna cost me money!"
"SpongeBob"," What is going on around here?"
"SpongeBob","  I'll help you, baby! Boing!"
"Patrick"," Boo!"
"SpongeBob"," I think I know a way to make you both happy."
"SpongeBob"," My spatula! T-Then what's this?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know."
"SpongeBob"," Ow! "
"SpongeBob","  Yeouch!"
"Squidward","  One Krabby Patty!"
"Plankton"," SpongeBoob? Why are you so small? Is this a trick?"
"SpongeBob"," Hooray!  I'll get that."
"SpongeBob","  Bleach!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Krusty Krab action figures aren't free ya know! So, get your parents' money and you can have it."
"Squidward"," Uh, Eugene, we don't sell action figures."
"SpongeBob"," Peekaboo!"
"SpongeBob"," Whoo-hoo! Yay!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Break time, SpongeBob! Take five, but hurry back! You gotta start earnin' that penny!"
"Squidward","  Hmph. Work the register, clean the windows, make the patties. I have to do everything now. Thanks a lot, ShrinkBob.  Ow! Ow! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Make a left at the light!"
"Patrick","  Yup."
"SpongeBob","  Ooh.  It's—it's—  It's stuff! "
"Patrick"," Wow."
"Patrick"," I wanna try!"
"Squidward","  SpongeBob! Patrick! What do you two think you're— wow."
"Squidward"," This is a soccer ball... that is a tennis racket,  and these are a couple of morons!  Now, be quiet! And clean up all of your sports junk!"
"Squidward"," Sure, but you have to do it...  blindfolded. "
"Patrick"," Um, do we throw now?"
"Patrick","  My face hurts."
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, can the game be over now? All this pain is starting to hurt."
"Squidward"," Oh, you're absolutely doing it right. Try to pick up the pace, though."
"Patrick"," Comin' through!"
"Sandy"," Huh? SpongeBob, what's going on?"
"Sandy"," Why not stop playing it if it hurts so bad?"
"Sandy"," You're making up a game where SpongeBob and Patrick hurt themselves, and you won't let them stop?!"
"Squidward"," See? They're fine. Let the games resume."
"Sandy"," Sure. Every time you score, you pick a new sport. I thought you knew all the rules, Squidward."
"Squidward","  Block what?"
"Squidward"," Ow, ow, ow."
"Sandy","  Thanks, boys. Looks like we're all done here. That goes for you too. I'm ending your game."
"SpongeBob"," You must be the new driving instructor."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you're a great instructor! What now?"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, I've heard of that!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy."
"SpongeBob"," Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks."
"SpongeBob"," Nice catch, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob"," Okay, I— "
"Mr. Krabs"," Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, this must be the Lost and Found!  It's not in here!"
"SpongeBob"," Excuse me! Oh!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Don't worry. There's a ladder."
"SpongeBob","  Yoink! Losers weepers! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Waaaaah!"
"SpongeBob"," Lost Toilets? "
"SpongeBob"," Tylo!"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't know."
"Patrick"," Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!"
"Patrick","  Oh."
"SpongeBob"," What you doin'?"
"Patrick","  Because I'm a nice guy! "
"SpongeBob"," Wow. There goes the nicest guy."
"Patrick","  Guh."
"Squidward"," You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton. "
"Patrick"," Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!"
"Patrick"," Hello?"
"Patrick","  Apples?"
"Patrick"," Hey, you're right! "
"Mr. Krabs","  I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!"
"SpongeBob"," What do you mean? I love it."
"Mr. Krabs"," Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!"
"SpongeBob"," When art gets older,  it usually gets more expensive.  Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday."
"Mr. Krabs","  Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this."
"Squidward"," Artist walking. Check me out."
"Squidward","  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," Your eyes are so pretty."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends."
"Mr. Krabs"," Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha.  Squidward, delivery! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Mars. "
"Squidward"," Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!"
"SpongeBob"," Run, Squidward, run!"
"Squidward"," True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!"
"Squidward"," What? Really?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm rich."
"Sandy"," Y'all are the best aquatic critter friends a lone star from out of town could ever have."
"SpongeBob"," Enjoy the cake, everybody. I made it special just for Sandy.  Mm."
"SpongeBob"," I'm pretty sure walnuts are a fruit though, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs"," I'm always a sucker for a good smooch."
"Sandy"," Hold your breath, creatures!"
"Sandy"," Oh, no, you don't."
"Sandy"," Texas toast! It's a good thing my treedome is made of ten tons of pressure proof glass, huh, Frenchy?"
"Sandy"," Ooh! Ohh!"
"Sandy"," Aah!"
"Sandy","  Yee haw! Whoo!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Patrick.  Wake up, Patrick!  Whoa!"
"SpongeBob"," No! "
"SpongeBob","  Bleach!  Ow!"
"Patrick"," Ohhhhhhh...  This whole place is a frozen treat! "
"SpongeBob"," No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!"
"Patrick","  Hot! Hot! Hot!  Hot! Agh! "
"SpongeBob"," I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?"
"SpongeBob"," I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Except that guy."
"Patrick","  What are you doing, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob","  I'm just checking out the beautiful clams. Did you know it's migration season?"
"Patrick"," You're a good friend.  So can I see the clams?"
"SpongeBob"," Sure! Here, use these. "
"SpongeBob"," Even a Razor Clam."
"SpongeBob"," Why, Squidward?"
"SpongeBob","  Bye! I'll see you crazy clams later."
"SpongeBob"," What am I going to do? I can't leave the clams alone. They'll just have to go to work with me. Come on, you clams!"
"SpongeBob"," Let's go, clams. Good boys!"
"SpongeBob"," Hey, there you are."
"Squidward"," Don't, ""Oh, hey, Squidward"" me! Not after you lured these monsters into town!  They are a menace to society and we want them out!"
"Plankton"," Yeesh. Calm down, Karen. You don't want to blow out your motherboard."
"Plankton"," Fine! If you insist, I'll find a non-vaporizing way to get rid of them. Jeez!"
"Plankton","  This is our corner now!"
"Plankton"," Wait, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob"," Thanks! You want him? He's free to a good home."
"Plankton","  Did you take this from your new owner? That is rude, puppy! Very, very rude!  Wait, you all took something...and brought it back to me? Hmm...  I don't need any of this junk."
"Plankton"," Identical Twin Puppies."
"SpongeBob"," Huh?  Whoa!  You'll never get away with this, Plankton!"
"Plankton"," First, we'll need a distraction inside the Krusty Krab. That's where the Identical Twin Puppies come into play."
"SpongeBob","  Woof, woof!"
"Plankton"," Come on, SpongeBob. Maybe we can work something out! I'll give ya 10% of my patty profits. Huh?"
"Patrick"," I believe this is yours."
"Squidward"," Eh. The world shudders at the thought."
"Mr. Krabs"," Okay, okay. That's enough. "
"Squidward"," You want me to what?"
"Squidward"," Hey!"
"SpongeBob"," Your turn, Mr. K."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday.  Everybody wins!"
"SpongeBob"," Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—"
"Mr. Krabs"," Free suits? Oh, boy! "
"SpongeBob","  Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?"
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa, there! Don't you need some other measurements? I mean, how 'bout my inseam? "
"SpongeBob"," Tell your friends about us!"
"Squidward"," Of course.  Up next, it says we have to get him an X-ray of him. Any ideas?"
"SpongeBob","  Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography!  Preserve your precious punim for generations to come!  Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Hoo! Gettin' kinda hot in here!  Should my underwear be on fire?"
"SpongeBob"," 25...thousand?"
"SpongeBob","  Boop!"
"SpongeBob"," Great! He's in the freezer right now."
"Mr. Krabs"," Whoa—no!"
"Squidward"," Oh, um...yes. Of course he did. Um, unfortunately, our results were—"
"SpongeBob","  Ooh."
"Plankton"," What? For cryin' out loud. All right, what would you like?"
"Squidward"," Oh, magic is real."
"SpongeBob"," My next friend is my best friend."
"Patrick"," Okay, Mister, you can—ow!  Ooh-ho-ho-ho! What are you do—? Ow, ow! Ow, Noggin, don't! Oh!"
"Plankton"," Ooh, izzy wizzy, let's get busy. "
"SpongeBob","  But it's a real genie, and I—I saved the last wish for you. "
"Plankton"," Your wish is my command!  You greedy crook. "
"SpongeBob"," No, Mr. Krabs! Oh, don't you all see? We shouldn't be fighting. Today we found out that magic is real. And that magic is magical and that magic makes you feel all sparkly and  carbonated inside."
"Mr. Krabs","  Mm..."
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, I don't care. You're trespassin'.  And litterin' paisleys!  Ha, ha! Back! Back you! Oh! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Hey, hold on there, lad. You might be overdoing the ingredients.  Huh, it's just broth."
"SpongeBob"," Aye-aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Squidward"," What's the problem?"
"Mr. Krabs"," SpongeBob!"
"Mr. Krabs"," I got one! "
"Squidward"," Me too! "
"Mr. Krabs"," It's your job to go into that soup and remove those hippies!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Son, how's the eviction going?"
"SpongeBob"," Hello? Anybody here?  Whoa! How long was I in that soup?  Mr. Krabs, is that you?"
"Mr. Krabs","  Well, I had to close down the Krusty Krab since you weren't around to make the Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob","  Making Krabby Patties was my number one favorite thing ever to do in the whole world!"
"Mr. Krabs","  I thought you'd never ask!"
"Squidward"," Oh, thanks, man.  Hippies!!!"
"Patrick"," I won't mention is bra."
"SpongeBob","  Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood! "
"SpongeBob"," Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit."
"Patrick","  He's all outta snacks!  Let's go."
"SpongeBob"," But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—"
"Patrick"," Ah-ah-ah— "
"Patrick"," I got my weapon!"
"SpongeBob","  ♪Dum-dah-dah!♪"
"Patrick"," Prepare to be framed! "
"SpongeBob"," Help yourself, Man Ray."
"Mr. Krabs"," I—I could use some me time."
"SpongeBob"," Order up! "
"Mr. Krabs"," That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?"
"Squidward","  Hey!  Can I help you?"
"SpongeBob"," Sorry!"
"SpongeBob"," Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym."
"SpongeBob","  Butter!  Lard!  Mayonnaise. "
"Squidward"," We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!"
"Squidward"," Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese! "
"SpongeBob","  Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape.  Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers."
"Patrick"," Those are too cute for Halloween, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year."
"Patrick"," Deal."
"Sandy"," Welcome to my lab, SpongeBob and Patrick. I am the evil Dr. Franken-Cheeks."
"Patrick"," Don't stop, SpongeBob. That's the spot. Ah..."
"SpongeBob"," Patrick, you really got me. "
"Sandy"," Ew!  How impolite of me! I forgot to introduce you to my little friend. "
"SpongeBob"," I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny."
"Mr. Krabs","  Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm Plankton! Ha, ha, ha, I'm evil! "
"Mr. Krabs"," I don't get it. When I was a kid, Halloween meant 24 continuous hours of screaming your head off! These kids today..."
"Patrick"," Where are we going, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob"," We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny! "
"SpongeBob","  That tickled!"
"SpongeBob"," Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place! "
"Squidward"," Huh? Oh! "
"Squidward"," Help us!"
"SpongeBob","  That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton.  Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical.  Why aren't you laughing?  Patrick? What's wrong with you?"
"SpongeBob"," Ahh!!"
"Plankton"," You know, I gotta say, pretty impressed with your whole evil presentation here. Nice work. I could use a guy like you to walk through walls. I take over the world, and we split it, 70-30. How's that grabbin' you?  Yes, master... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures. "
"Sandy"," I don't know what's inside that brain of yours, but I sure hope I never see it. Thanks, SpongeBob."
"Patrick"," Balloons? Aw, it's just a stupid old bus."
"Patrick"," Our first landmark is the kissing stone of the ancients. It is said to bring good luck to all who smooch it. "
"Patrick"," On your left is a kid who, legend has it, used to have an ice cream cone."
"Patrick"," We have begun our descent."
"Squidward"," And stay out! "
"Plankton"," Hey!"
"Patrick"," Try it, everyone. It's fun."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, shucks, I'm just getting warmed up.  Uh-huh! Yeah! Eh, eh?  Ooh! "
"SpongeBob"," Whoo! Yeah!  Uh-huh, uh-huh!  Uh-huh!  Ooh!  Uh-huh! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out."
"Squidward"," Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good.  Huh?! "
"SpongeBob","  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs","  SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!"
"SpongeBob"," And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Look, I'm in a hurry. You have this special project."
"Mr. Krabs"," Here you go, gentlemen. Two brand new patties. "
"SpongeBob","  What's going on?"
"Sandy","  Ooh. Ehh, I never shoulda eaten four.  Uh! Ah!  Huh! "
"SpongeBob"," Those aren't customers out there, Plankton. They're all Krabby Patty zombie monsters! And they're forcing everybody to eat them! You and I are the last two survivors!"
"Plankton"," Okay, I believe it!"
"Patrick"," Oh, a patty. "
"SpongeBob","  Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Who needs a bathroom when I can shave and drive to work at the same time? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh! That's me! "
"SpongeBob","  Ehh. Ah. Whoa. Sorry I'm late."
"SpongeBob"," Ohh, I think someone is nervous about being the new kid in class. Well, no worry, I'll show you all the ropes.  Did you know that every time you do something good, Mrs. Puff gives you a star sticker? "
"Plankton"," How about some melon? "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I want some.  Doink! Ehh, ehh."
"Plankton","  Can't catch me, Eugene! I'm the number one driver! "
"Mr. Krabs"," Never!"
"Plankton"," Oh, come on! Don't we at least deserve some credit for not getting hurt? I mean, that was crazy dangerous!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Yeah, it was!"
"Squidward","  You're just filthy trash!  Get in the bag! Stupid trash!   Trash juice!                                                                                  "
"Squidward","  Ow!"
"Squidward"," Oof! "
"Squidward"," Did you have to catch him that easily?"
"SpongeBob"," All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back."
"SpongeBob","  Oh, oh, oh, oh! "
"Patrick"," Hooray!"
"SpongeBob"," Hold still, Patrick, I see you. "
"SpongeBob"," Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!"
"Squidward"," They're growing! "
"Squidward","  His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool."
"Squidward","  My...  partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little ""Good cop, bad cop"" would get his jaw flapping so I–"
"Mr. Krabs"," What the–"
"Squidward"," Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?  Now, where were you earlier–"
"Squidward","  We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!"
"SpongeBob","  Good contours.  And still warm. Story checks out. "
"Mr. Krabs"," Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!"
"Squidward","  We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside."
"Squidward","  Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects."
"Squidward"," Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!"
"Patrick"," Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish. "
"SpongeBob","  Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief..."
"Squidward"," My baby!  Ha!"
"SpongeBob"," Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music."
"Squidward"," Why are you nitwits in my house?"
"SpongeBob"," Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here."
"SpongeBob"," Sandwich?"
"Squidward","  Phew. I am a genius."
"SpongeBob"," Badlands, 20,000 leagues?"
"Squidward"," Sand? "
"SpongeBob"," We're back!"
"Squidward","  Your next mission is to find  the Loch Ness Monster and bring him back...alive."
"SpongeBob"," But it sure loves to eat 'em!"
"Squidward","  He was an early bloomer."
"Patrick"," Two brothers! Us!"
"SpongeBob"," Ah, I don't know what I love more, Squidward, feeding people Krabby Patties during the day, or cleaning up their mess at night."
"Squidward"," Ow! Hey, watch it— "
"SpongeBob"," That's no urchin, it's a Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob"," Mmm... "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, hey, Gary. Say hello to my new best friend, Cuddle E. Hugs."
"SpongeBob"," Here's my room. You can take the bed, if you want."
"SpongeBob"," How'd you sleep, Cuddle E.?  Oh, good morning, Gary. Hey, have you seen Cuddle E. Hugs anywhere?"
"SpongeBob","  You're still here!"
"SpongeBob"," You should meet my other friends. They are gonna love you. "
"Squidward"," Please get out of my way, and stop talking to me."
"Sandy","  What's up with Patrick? He looks madder than a rattlesnake in a room full of rocking chairs."
"SpongeBob"," He's the giant hamster, right there! "
"Sandy"," Oh, I get it. He's your  imaginary friend."
"SpongeBob"," There is?"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm... Maybe I should share my magic sandwich with my friends. That way, they can see you, and see how awesome you are!"
"SpongeBob"," Hmm?  Aged Krabby Patties here! Get your artisanal aged Krabby Patties here!  Did I mention they were free?"
"Sandy"," Mmm. "
"SpongeBob"," I thought we were friends! "
"SpongeBob"," I just don't get it. Why did he act like that last night? I thought we were BFFs. I need to talk to him."
"SpongeBob"," Okay, Patrick, one more book, then you go to sleep, 'kay?"
"Patrick"," That's what I want to be!"
"SpongeBob"," Cowboy. Great choice."
"Patrick"," A horse.  A horse. "
"SpongeBob","  Not now, Gary. Give me a few more minutes.  What? Uh, Gary? "
"SpongeBob"," Whoa!  Ride 'em, cowboy!"
"Squidward"," Now, I don't mean to nag, so don't bridle me when I say this, but your dream horse is more like a nightmare!  Get it? Night? Mare? Ha-ha!"
"SpongeBob","  Horsey Patrick, come back! "
"Mr. Krabs","  Clopity, clopity, clopity."
"SpongeBob"," Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me.  Patrick horsey, giddy up!"
"Mr. Krabs"," Quiet.  Horseys don't talk. Okay, kids, ten bucks a ride! Who's next?"
"Mr. Krabs"," This shortcut sign should send SpongeBob and Patrick far from the finish line.  Hi-ho, Squidward! "
"SpongeBob","  How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy? "
"SpongeBob"," What, you're not hungry?"
"SpongeBob"," Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?"
"SpongeBob"," Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar."
"Sandy","  Walnuts are extra nutty."
"SpongeBob"," Oh, not to me.  To Gary."
"SpongeBob"," Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?"
"Squidward"," Really?  Well, maybe I'll give him a guided tour."
"Squidward"," Hold on now!"
"Squidward","  Oh, gee, do you have to?"
"Squidward"," Good night.  Now, let's see if SpongeBob still wants you to talk after tonight. "
"SpongeBob","  At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water.  Here you go, buddy, one water. "
"Squidward","  My bed is too lumpy."
"SpongeBob","  Why not?"
"SpongeBob"," Ooh."
"SpongeBob"," You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?"
"SpongeBob"," I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you."
"SpongeBob","  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not Mrs. Puff's Boating School!"
"SpongeBob"," Honey pie?!"
"SpongeBob"," Oh, I'm not shopping. I'm playing."
"SpongeBob","  Ah-ow! Wow."
"SpongeBob"," Self-driving? "
"SpongeBob"," Wow, you talk. How'd you know my name?"
"SpongeBob","  Whoa!  Here, take this!  What's up?"
"SpongeBob"," Gary, what is that? "
"SpongeBob"," I have to go to work."
"SpongeBob"," Or I could just go. "
"SpongeBob"," Oh, nothing.  Hey, wait! "
"SpongeBob"," Good to know,  because I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts!"
"SpongeBob"," Well played, Coupe."
"SpongeBob","  I hate to do this to you, Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, but I have no choice. "
"Patrick"," Ah, I thought I smelled ice cream. "
"SpongeBob"," My self-driving days are over."
"Patrick"," Ohh! "
