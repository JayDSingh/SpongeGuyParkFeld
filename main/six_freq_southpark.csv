"10","1","Stan","Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
"
"10","1","Stan","Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
"
"10","1","Stan","But are you back for good?
"
"10","1","Randy","Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
"
"10","1","Randy","Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
"
"10","1","Kyle","Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
"
"10","1","Stan","Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
"
"10","1","Stan","What?
"
"10","1","Stan","...WHAT??
"
"10","1","Stan","No, he's not.
"
"10","1","Kyle","Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
"
"10","1","Cartman","...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
"
"10","1","Cartman","Yeah!
"
"10","1","Kyle","Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
"
"10","1","Kyle","Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
"
"10","1","Cartman","Oh, son of a bitch!
"
"10","1","Cartman","No, Chef has always been super-cool.
"
"10","1","Stan","This isn't working.
"
"10","1","Cartman","Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
"
"10","1","Stan","Immortal.
"
"10","1","Stan","We're not leaving without Chef.
"
"10","1","Kyle","No! Hey!
"
"10","1","Kyle","Chef, come on!
"
"10","1","Cartman","Run Chef!
"
"10","1","Kyle","Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
"
"10","2","Kyle","Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
"
"10","2","Stan","Going away party? What do you mean?
"
"10","2","Stan","Kyle? Kyle!
"
"10","2","Kyle","My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
"
"10","2","Stan","Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
"
"10","2","Stan","I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
"
"10","2","Stan","Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
"
"10","2","Cartman","Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
"
"10","2","Butters","Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 
"
"10","2","Stan","What?!
"
"10","2","Kyle","Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
"
"10","2","Kyle","Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
"
"10","2","Stan","I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
"
"10","2","Stan","Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
"
"10","2","Kyle","Hey Stan.
"
"10","2","Stan","Dude, what happened?? 
"
"10","2","Kyle","Yeah!
"
"10","2","Randy","Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
"
"10","2","Cartman","We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
"
"10","3","Stan","What?? What??
"
"10","3","Randy","JUST GET THE GUN!! 
"
"10","3","Stan","They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
"
"10","3","Kyle","Hehaha, heh.
"
"10","3","Kyle","Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
"
"10","3","Stan","Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
"
"10","3","Cartman","That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
"
"10","3","Randy","FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
"
"10","3","Cartman","Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
"
"10","3","Stan","Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
"
"10","3","Cartman","Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
"
"10","3","Cartman","All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
"
"10","3","Kyle","No!
"
"10","3","Kyle","Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 
"
"10","3","Kyle","Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
"
"10","3","Kyle","I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
"
"10","3","Cartman","It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
"10","3","Cartman","Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
"
"10","3","Cartman","Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
"
"10","3","Kyle","Ahhh!
"
"10","3","Randy","It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
"
"10","3","Stan","Dad, this is stupid.
"
"10","3","Kyle","No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 
"
"10","4","Cartman","I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
"
"10","4","Kyle","You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
"
"10","4","Cartman","It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
"
"10","4","Kyle","What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
"
"10","4","Kyle","Thanks a lot for the ride.
"
"10","4","Kyle","Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
"
"10","4","Cartman","Wha?  What are they?
"
"10","4","Cartman","Why not?
"
"10","4","Cartman","Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
"
"10","4","Kyle","Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
"
"10","4","Cartman","Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
"
"10","4","Kyle","WHAT?!
"
"10","4","Kyle","Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
"
"10","4","Kyle","There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
"
"10","4","Cartman","Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
"
"10","4","Kyle","Thanks, kid.
"
"10","4","Kyle","No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
"
"10","4","Kyle","Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
"
"10","4","Kyle","I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
"
"10","4","Cartman","No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
"
"10","6","Kyle","We know. 
"
"10","6","Kyle","He's half man and half bearpig
"
"10","6","Randy","Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
"
"10","6","Kyle","What?
"
"10","6","Cartman","Hello??
"
"10","6","Kyle","A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
"
"10","6","Kyle","Cartman, you okay??  You need help??
"
"10","6","Cartman","I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
"
"10","6","Kyle","They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
"
"10","6","Cartman","Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
"
"10","6","Stan","Dude, he's really sick. 
"
"10","6","Stan","I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
"
"10","6","Cartman","Yes you do! 
"
"10","6","Kyle","I need your help!
"
"10","6","Cartman","No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
"
"10","6","Cartman","That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
"
"10","6","Cartman","Eh! 
"
"10","7","Cartman","Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
"
"10","7","Cartman","No thanks, I'd rather naught.
"
"10","7","Cartman","Time out?
"
"10","7","Cartman","Ummm, no?
"
"10","7","Cartman","Well, yeah.
"
"10","7","Cartman","Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
"
"10","7","Cartman","KNOCK IT OFF!
"
"10","7","Cartman","Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
"
"10","7","Cartman","Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
"
"10","7","Cartman","God dammit stop ignoring me!
"
"10","7","Cartman","Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
"
"10","7","Cartman","Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
"
"10","7","Cartman","All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
"
"10","7","Cartman","Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
"
"10","7","Cartman","...Should that really matter at a time like this?
"
"10","7","Cartman","That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
"
"10","7","Cartman","What is he still doing here?!
"
"10","7","Butters","Kill your mom?
"
"10","7","Stan","Dude, have you lost more weight?
"
"10","7","Cartman","Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
"
"10","7","Stan","Where am I supposed to get a gun?
"
"10","7","Cartman","Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
"
"10","7","Cartman","Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
"
"10","8","Stan","Dude! We've been waiting forever!
"
"10","8","Cartman","Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
"
"10","8","Randy","Stan!
"
"10","8","Stan","I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
"
"10","8","Kyle","Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
"
"10","8","Kyle","Who is that guy?
"
"10","8","Stan","Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
"
"10","8","Randy","Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
"
"10","8","Cartman","All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
"
"10","8","Cartman","What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
"
"10","8","Stan","We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
"
"10","8","Cartman","That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
"
"10","8","Cartman","Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
"
"10","8","Stan","I'm in.
"
"10","8","Stan","15 agility.
"
"10","8","Cartman","Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
"
"10","8","Stan","Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
"
"10","8","Cartman","Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
"
"10","8","Stan","Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
"
"10","8","Cartman","Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
"
"10","8","Cartman","Everyone target scorpions.
"
"10","8","Randy","Nn-Oh my God! 
"
"10","8","Kyle","Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 
"
"10","8","Stan","Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
"
"10","8","Stan","Kyle, you have to keep playing.
"
"10","8","Randy","Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!
"
"10","8","Randy","Give me the sword.
"
"10","8","Stan","You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
"
"10","8","Cartman","It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
"
"10","8","Kyle","I'm out of mana, I told you.
"
"10","8","Stan","I've gotta heal. 
"
"10","8","Randy","Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
"
"10","8","Stan","Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
"
"10","8","Cartman","All right, yay.
"
"10","9","Kyle","Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
"
"10","9","Stan","Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
"
"10","9","Kyle","Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
"
"10","9","Butters","From Eric.
"
"10","9","Cartman","For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
"
"10","9","Cartman","Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
"
"10","9","Randy","How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
"
"10","9","Randy","Godspeed.
"
"10","9","Kyle","Aaaah!
"
"10","9","Stan","Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
"
"10","9","Kyle","Really?
"
"10","9","Stan","Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
"
"10","9","Kyle","Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
"
"10","9","Kyle","No. Way.
"
"10","9","Stan","He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
"
"10","9","Kyle","Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
"
"10","9","Stan","Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
"
"10","9","Kyle","Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
"
"10","9","Stan","Who are you?
"
"10","9","Kyle","Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
"
"10","9","Kyle","You knew this whole time? Why?
"
"10","9","Stan","Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
"
"10","10","Cartman","And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
"
"10","10","Cartman","I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
"
"10","10","Cartman","The hall monit- me?
"
"10","10","Cartman","There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
"
"10","10","Cartman","All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
"
"10","10","Cartman","Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
"
"10","10","Butters","Haaaah!
"
"10","10","Cartman","I knew it! 
"
"10","10","Kyle","Ike?
"
"10","10","Kyle","I think so.
"
"10","10","Kyle","Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
"
"10","10","Cartman","What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"
"10","10","Cartman","They what??
"
"10","10","Cartman","Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
"
"10","10","Cartman","You're goin' with Christ! 
"
"10","10","Cartman","I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
"
"10","10","Kyle","Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
"
"10","10","Kyle","I'm dead to you?
"
"10","10","Kyle","Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 
"
"10","10","Kyle","Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
"
"10","10","Cartman","I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
"
"10","10","Kyle","Oh crap! 
"
"10","10","Kyle","Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
"
"10","11","Kyle","I am doing it.
"
"10","11","Cartman","What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
"
"10","11","Cartman","Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
"
"10","11","Butters","Then do it, if you're not yellow! 
"
"10","11","Cartman","Dude...
"
"10","11","Cartman","You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
"
"10","11","Kyle","He's right. It's just a spook story.
"
"10","12","Cartman","How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
"
"10","12","Cartman","Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
"
"10","12","Stan","Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
"
"10","12","Cartman","I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
"
"10","12","Stan","Do what?
"
"10","12","Cartman","Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
"
"10","12","Stan","Dude, no way.
"
"10","12","Butters","Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
"
"10","12","Cartman","No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
"
"10","12","Butters","I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
"
"10","12","Cartman","Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
"
"10","12","Cartman","What??
"
"10","12","Stan","Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
"
"10","12","Butters","Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
"
"10","12","Butters","He told me to!
"
"10","12","Butters","What??
"
"10","12","Cartman","So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
"
"10","12","Cartman","And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
"
"10","12","Cartman","I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
"
"10","13","Cartman","Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
"
"10","13","Cartman","Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
"
"10","13","Cartman","You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
"
"10","13","Cartman","I care! Where's the closest toy store??
"
"10","13","Cartman","I want one of those time-phone things.
"
"10","13","Cartman","Look, I have to have one of those phones!
"
"10","13","Cartman","Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
"
"10","13","Cartman","Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
"
"10","13","Cartman","What?? Who the hell is this?!
"
"10","13","Cartman","Oh very funny, Kyle!
"
"10","13","Butters","Huh??
"
"10","13","Cartman","What??  Who the fuck is this?!
"
"10","13","Cartman","Are you spying on me?!
"
"10","13","Butters","Oh, all right then.
"
"10","13","Kyle","Suck my balls, fatass.
"
"10","13","Cartman","Who?
"
"10","13","Cartman","Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
"
"10","14","Stan","My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
"
"10","14","Stan","All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
"
"10","14","Stan","NO! 
"
"10","14","Randy","...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
"
"10","14","Stan","What are you talking about?
"
"10","14","Randy","Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
"
"10","14","Randy","Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
"
"10","14","Stan","Oh
"
"10","14","Stan","... I don't know.
"
"10","14","Stan","Oh uh, hey Nelson.
"
"10","14","Stan","Ogh.
"
"10","14","Stan","Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
"
"10","14","Stan","Get near the puck! 
"
"10","14","Stan","How are you feeling?
"
"10","14","Stan","Well, sure we can.
"
"11","1","Kyle","Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
"11","1","Stan","Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
"
"11","1","Cartman","Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
"11","1","Stan","Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
"
"11","1","Butters","A midget?
"
"11","1","Cartman","No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
"11","1","Cartman","Barely! 
"
"11","1","Cartman","Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
"11","1","Randy","Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say ""Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.""  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"".  Respect. 
"
"11","1","Stan","God dammit!
"
"11","1","Randy","Awww! Awwww! 
"
"11","1","Stan","I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
"
"11","1","Randy","We did it!
"
"11","1","Kyle","I don't get it either.
"
"11","1","Stan","Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
"
"11","2","Cartman","Kyyyle!
"
"11","2","Stan","What'cha do to Butters this time?
"
"11","2","Cartman","It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
"11","2","Cartman","Eh- ...what?
"
"11","2","Cartman","But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
"11","2","Stan","You can't!
"
"11","2","Kyle","Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
"11","2","Butters","Whoa, hey Eric.
"
"11","2","Cartman","It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
"11","2","Butters","Y-yeah!
"
"11","2","Cartman","Hang on a second here. 
"
"11","2","Butters","Oh uh, ho yeah.
"
"11","2","Cartman","...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
"11","2","Butters","Hey. Where'd Eric go?
"
"11","2","Kyle","What are you talking about, fatass?
"
"11","2","Kyle","And all the people we tell.
"
"11","2","Butters","Because I'm bi-curious?
"
"11","2","Stan","Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
"
"11","2","Kyle","Let go of me.
"
"11","2","Stan","What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
"11","2","Cartman","I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
"11","2","Cartman","You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
"11","2","Butters","He's bi-curious too?
"
"11","2","Cartman","Why... why does that matter?
"
"11","2","Cartman","No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
"11","2","Butters","Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"
"11","2","Butters","Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
"
"11","2","Butters","All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"
"11","2","Butters","No. I like bein' bi-curious.
"
"11","2","Cartman","And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
"11","3","Cartman","Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
"11","3","Butters","Yeah! Dumb girls!
"
"11","3","Kyle","It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
"11","3","Cartman","There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
"11","3","Kyle","Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
"11","3","Cartman","Kenny!
"
"11","4","Cartman","What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
"11","4","Butters","Now you go, Baahir. 
"
"11","4","Kyle","Yeah?
"
"11","4","Kyle","What? Why?
"
"11","4","Kyle","Over a hundred.
"
"11","4","Cartman","Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
"11","4","Cartman","Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
"11","4","Cartman","Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
"11","4","Cartman","What?
"
"11","4","Cartman","He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
"11","4","Cartman","LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
"11","4","Cartman","Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
"11","4","Cartman","It's my balls! 
"
"11","4","Cartman","Why? Did you find something?
"
"11","4","Cartman","Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
"11","4","Cartman","Big surprise!
"
"11","4","Cartman","Where is the detonator?!
"
"11","4","Kyle","Hey.
"
"11","4","Cartman","You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
"11","4","Kyle","Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
"11","4","Butters","Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
"
"11","4","Cartman","Where is the detonator!
"
"11","4","Cartman","Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
"11","4","Cartman","The Russians?
"
"11","4","Cartman","You can't possible mean...?
"
"11","4","Cartman","But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
"11","4","Cartman","Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
"11","5","Cartman","Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
"11","5","Randy","We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
"
"11","5","Stan","I don't understand!
"
"11","5","Randy","Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
"
"11","5","Stan","Must I?
"
"11","5","Stan","Yeah, I wanna know already.
"
"11","5","Stan","Where am I supposed to go?
"
"11","5","Kyle","...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
"11","5","Stan","Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
"
"11","5","Kyle","Peter Rabbit.
"
"11","5","Kyle","I don't believe it.
"
"11","5","Stan","They found me!
"
"11","5","Stan","Okay, fine. 
"
"11","5","Randy","No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
"
"11","5","Kyle","What?
"
"11","5","Kyle","Don't make me do this.
"
"11","5","Kyle","...Jesus?
"
"11","6","Cartman","Have you lost your mind?
"
"11","6","Butters","But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
"
"11","6","Stan","Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
"
"11","6","Cartman","They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
"11","6","Kyle","Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
"11","6","Cartman","Crap! 
"
"11","6","Butters","You have to be careful with scissors.
"
"11","6","Stan","These guys are pretty good.
"
"11","7","Kyle","Really?
"
"11","7","Kyle","Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
"11","7","Kyle","God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
"
"11","7","Kyle","You're welcome. 
"
"11","7","Stan","I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
"
"11","7","Kyle","Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
"
"11","7","Stan","Kyle, what were you thinking?
"
"11","7","Cartman","Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
"11","7","Randy","Huh! I don't have any change. 
"
"11","7","Randy","Help! Help us!
"
"11","7","Kyle","Oh my God.
"
"11","7","Cartman","You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
"11","7","Stan","There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
"
"11","7","Cartman","All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
"11","7","Kyle","What's it doing?
"
"11","7","Cartman","Cool.
"
"11","7","Kyle","What about you?
"
"11","7","Cartman","Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
"11","7","Randy","Those are cherry! Ich!
"
"11","7","Stan","We, just came to ask a question.
"
"11","7","Kyle","Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
"11","7","Stan","Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
"
"11","7","Cartman","Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
"
"11","7","Stan","What?
"
"11","7","Randy","A bus! A bus is coming!
"
"11","7","Cartman","Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
"11","7","Randy","Oh Glen! We made it!
"
"11","8","Cartman","Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
"11","8","Cartman","What?
"
"11","8","Cartman","Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
"11","8","Cartman","Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
"11","8","Cartman","Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
"11","8","Kyle","Will you knock it off already?!
"
"11","8","Kyle","N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
"
"11","8","Cartman","That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
"11","8","Kyle","L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
"11","8","Kyle","Dude...
"
"11","8","Cartman","Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
"11","8","Cartman","Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
"11","8","Cartman","Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
"11","8","Cartman","Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
"11","8","Cartman","Hm. That was... weird.
"
"11","8","Cartman","No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
"11","8","Cartman","My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
"11","8","Cartman","I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
"11","8","Cartman","Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
"11","8","Kyle","Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
"11","8","Kyle","Surprise, fatass!
"
"11","8","Kyle","What?
"
"11","9","Randy","How painful is ""painful""?
"
"11","9","Randy","Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
"
"11","9","Randy","You wanna see it?
"
"11","9","Randy","The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
"
"11","9","Randy","Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
"
"11","9","Stan","Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
"
"11","9","Randy","You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
"
"11","9","Randy","Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
"
"11","9","Randy","Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
"
"11","9","Randy","Can I, can I see it?
"
"11","10","Kyle","Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
"11","10","Kyle","Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
"11","10","Cartman","Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
"11","10","Cartman","Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
"11","10","Stan","...What do you know about the leprechaun?
"
"11","10","Butters","Ah, all right then.
"
"11","10","Stan","Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
"
"11","10","Kyle","STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
"11","10","Kyle","...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
"11","10","Stan","Yeah! How'd you know?
"
"11","10","Kyle","What did they say??
"
"11","10","Butters","Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
"
"11","10","Butters","Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
"
"11","10","Butters","Uh what's the Barrier?
"
"11","10","Butters","Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
"
"11","10","Cartman","Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
"11","10","Stan","Dude, do you really have to do it?
"
"11","11","Stan","What is this place?
"
"11","11","Butters","Hold on, fellas!
"
"11","11","Butters","WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
"
"11","11","Stan","The Imagination song?
"
"11","11","Cartman","Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
"11","11","Kyle","Stan?
"
"11","11","Stan","Dude, you did make a deal... 
"
"11","11","Cartman","Theee conference room is which way? 
"
"11","11","Kyle","Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
"11","11","Kyle","Just get to it already!
"
"11","11","Stan","Wait, woodland critters... 
"
"11","11","Cartman","No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
"11","11","Cartman","No! Goddammit no!
"
"11","11","Kyle","AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
"11","11","Cartman","No! Kyle can't die. 
"
"11","11","Cartman","Zap him again!  Do it!
"
"11","12","Cartman","What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
"11","12","Cartman","Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
"11","12","Butters","How?
"
"11","12","Butters","AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 
"
"11","12","Butters","GAA HAA!
"
"11","12","Kyle","Oh for the love of God!
"
"11","12","Stan","Hello? Can anybody hear me?
"
"11","12","Kyle","Dude, what's happening?
"
"11","12","Stan","I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
"
"11","12","Butters","Santa. Saaanta.
"
"11","12","Cartman","How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
"11","12","Kyle","Oh no.
"
"11","12","Cartman","...What?
"
"11","12","Cartman","We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
"11","12","Cartman","Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
"11","12","Kyle","Hi Superman.
"
"11","12","Cartman","Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
"11","12","Cartman","Kyle?
"
"11","12","Kyle","You have to stop!
"
"11","12","Kyle","Cartman, don't!
"
"11","12","Cartman","Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
"11","13","Randy","Ohhh.
"
"11","13","Stan","Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
"
"11","13","Cartman","Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
"11","13","Randy","But... But this is real.
"
"11","13","Stan","Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
"
"11","13","Butters","They're gonna do it!
"
"11","13","Randy","You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
"
"11","13","Stan","Yeah?
"
"11","13","Kyle","Oh my God!
"
"11","13","Kyle","Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
"
"11","13","Stan","Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
"
"11","13","Stan","But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
"
"11","13","Kyle","Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
"11","13","Stan","Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
"
"11","13","Cartman","Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
"11","13","Kyle","I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
"11","13","Stan","Dude, this is awesome.
"
"11","13","Stan","Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
"
"11","13","Stan","We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
"
"11","13","Stan","Man...
"
"11","13","Stan","No problem.
"
"11","13","Kyle","I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
"11","13","Stan","The dragon. Where did it go?
"
"11","13","Stan","Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
"
"11","13","Butters","Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
"
"11","14","Stan","Dude, Butters, calm down.
"
"11","14","Cartman","All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
"11","14","Cartman","Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
"11","14","Cartman","Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
"11","14","Cartman","Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
"11","14","Cartman","What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
"11","14","Kyle","No way.
"
"11","14","Kyle","I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
"11","14","Stan","Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 
"
"11","14","Butters","Whoopie! 
"
"11","14","Kyle","Oh God! I do?
"
"11","14","Cartman","Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
"11","14","Stan","Just for a minute. Over here. 
"
"11","14","Stan","I have no idea what you're talking about.
"
"11","14","Stan","What's going on?
"
"11","14","Stan","Wendy! 
"
"12","1","Cartman","What?
"
"12","1","Cartman","Uh. It's over?
"
"12","1","Cartman","You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
"12","1","Butters","Oh no.
"
"12","1","Kyle","...No. Way.
"
"12","1","Cartman","God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
"12","1","Cartman","So this is it?
"
"12","1","Stan","Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
"
"12","1","Cartman","...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
"12","1","Cartman","Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
"12","1","Stan","Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
"
"12","1","Cartman","Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
"12","1","Butters","Okay, but... what are you going to do?
"
"12","1","Cartman","Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
"12","1","Butters","Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
"12","1","Cartman","Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
"12","1","Kyle","No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
"12","1","Cartman","Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
"12","1","Kyle","Why do I have HIV?!
"
"12","1","Cartman","Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
"12","1","Cartman","Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
"12","1","Cartman","Kind of.
"
"12","1","Kyle","An apology?!
"
"12","1","Cartman","I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
"12","1","Kyle","A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
"12","1","Cartman","Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
"12","1","Kyle","There is no cure, you asshole!
"
"12","1","Kyle","Magic Johnson?
"
"12","1","Cartman","Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
"12","1","Kyle","Don't. Touch me.
"
"12","1","Kyle","Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
"12","1","Kyle","Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
"12","1","Cartman","What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
"12","2","Cartman","That's enough to buy slaves!
"
"12","2","Cartman","Sweet!
"
"12","2","Butters","Hokay. 
"
"12","2","Kyle","A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
"12","2","Butters","Not me! I'm a squirrel!
"
"12","2","Kyle","Ahall right!
"
"12","2","Kyle","How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
"12","2","Stan","We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
"
"12","2","Stan","She doesn't have any lips!
"
"12","2","Kyle","Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
"12","2","Stan","I know where.
"
"12","2","Stan","Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
"
"12","2","Stan","You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 
"
"12","2","Kyle","NO!
"
"12","2","Stan","All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
"
"12","3","Kyle","Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
"12","3","Stan","Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
"
"12","3","Kyle","Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
"12","3","Kyle","Kenny? 
"
"12","3","Stan","Kenny, you home? 
"
"12","3","Butters","Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
"
"12","3","Kyle","Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
"12","3","Kyle","No.
"
"12","3","Cartman","Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
"12","3","Cartman","Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
"12","3","Kyle","What?
"
"12","3","Stan","He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
"
"12","3","Cartman","Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
"12","3","Kyle","Kenny! 
"
"12","3","Stan","What the hell kind of flowers are those?
"
"12","4","Cartman","No! NOOO!
"
"12","4","Kyle","Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
"12","4","Butters","Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
"
"12","4","Stan","Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
"
"12","4","Kyle","Yeah. Here you go. 
"
"12","4","Stan","Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
"12","5","Cartman","Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
"12","5","Kyle","Kenny's!
"
"12","5","Cartman","Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
"12","5","Cartman","No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
"12","5","Kyle","What?
"
"12","5","Butters","Yeah, that must be his.
"
"12","5","Cartman","Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
"12","5","Cartman","Again!
"
"12","5","Cartman","How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
"12","5","Cartman","Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
"12","5","Cartman","You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
"12","5","Cartman","I reeached these keeeds.
"
"12","6","Randy","Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
"
"12","6","Randy","Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 
"
"12","6","Stan","My Internet's not working either.
"
"12","6","Randy","I know that, okay?!
"
"12","6","Randy","Our house... It has no Internet.
"
"12","6","Randy","Oh no you're not!
"
"12","6","Kyle","Ih it's not working.
"
"12","6","Randy","It's not working, Gerald.
"
"12","6","Randy","God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 
"
"12","6","Randy","How do you know?!
"
"12","6","Mr. Garrison","There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
"
"12","6","Randy","Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
"
"12","6","Randy","Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
"
"12","6","Randy","Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
"
"12","6","Randy","Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
"
"12","6","Randy","NetZero.
"
"12","6","Kyle","Where... is... the Internet?
"
"12","6","Randy","You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
"
"12","6","Stan","Hey! Mom!
"
"12","6","Randy","Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
"
"12","7","Mr. Garrison","Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
"
"12","7","Stan","Naw, I'm with Wendy.
"
"12","7","Cartman","Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
"12","7","Cartman","That isn't necessary!
"
"12","7","Mr. Garrison","Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
"
"12","7","Cartman","Butters, come on!
"
"12","7","Cartman","I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
"12","7","Kyle","Come on, this is serious!
"
"12","7","Cartman","All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
"12","7","Cartman","Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
"12","7","Kyle","The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
"12","7","Butters","What are you whoofelin' at? 
"
"12","7","Cartman","Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
"12","7","Mr. Garrison","Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
"
"12","7","Stan","He done killed yer pahr.
"
"12","7","Stan","I know.
"
"12","8","Cartman","Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
"12","8","Kyle","I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
"12","8","Stan","Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
"
"12","8","Butters","Uhuh, Eric.
"
"12","8","Cartman","The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
"12","8","Butters","Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
"
"12","8","Cartman","Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
"12","8","Butters","Well sure.
"
"12","8","Cartman","This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
"12","8","Butters","Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
"
"12","8","Cartman","Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
"12","8","Cartman","Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
"12","8","Stan","I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
"
"12","8","Cartman","Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
"12","8","Cartman","...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
"12","8","Butters","We're busted! Uh what do we do??
"
"12","8","Butters","Huh?
"
"12","8","Cartman","It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
"12","8","Cartman","One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
"12","8","Cartman","I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
"12","9","Cartman","Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
"12","9","Mr. Garrison","Eric, for the love of Jesus...
"
"12","9","Cartman","Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
"12","9","Cartman","You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
"12","9","Cartman","You're gonna fight me after school?
"
"12","9","Cartman","Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
"12","9","Stan","What?
"
"12","9","Cartman","You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
"12","9","Stan","Really?
"
"12","9","Cartman","You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
"12","9","Mr. Garrison","And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
"
"12","9","Butters","Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
"12","9","Cartman","That's not why I did it.
"
"12","9","Butters","That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
"12","9","Butters","Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
"12","9","Cartman","Told you guys.
"
"12","9","Cartman","Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
"12","9","Butters","All right! 
"
"12","9","Cartman","What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
"12","9","Stan","Dude, we never thought you were cool.
"
"12","9","Cartman","That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
"12","9","Cartman","Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
"12","10","Stan","Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
"
"12","10","Cartman","Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
"12","10","Stan","God!
"
"12","10","Cartman","Shut up already!
"
"12","10","Randy","Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
"
"12","10","Cartman","Really? Are you sure?
"
"12","10","Stan","Yeah!
"
"12","10","Stan","All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
"
"12","10","Cartman","And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
"12","10","Kyle","Gracias.
"
"12","10","Stan","This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
"
"12","10","Randy","There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
"
"12","10","Stan","No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
"
"12","10","Mr. Garrison","They're really furry! 
"
"12","10","Randy","What did that?!  What is that thing?! 
"
"12","11","Randy","I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
"
"12","11","Cartman","You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
"12","11","Stan","Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
"
"12","11","Kyle","Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
"12","11","Mr. Garrison","Guinea rats?
"
"12","11","Randy","I'm so startled.
"
"12","11","Mr. Garrison","In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
"
"12","11","Randy","Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
"
"12","11","Kyle","How do you do that?
"
"12","11","Kyle","Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
"12","12","Randy","Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
"
"12","12","Randy","Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 
"
"12","12","Randy","I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
"
"12","12","Butters","Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
"
"12","12","Randy","Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
"
"12","12","Kyle","What?!
"
"12","12","Stan","Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
"
"12","12","Kyle","Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
"12","12","Randy","Wooo, change.
"
"12","12","Stan","Dad Dad, we have a problem.
"
"12","12","Randy","We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
"
"12","12","Randy","You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
"
"12","12","Kyle","E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
"12","12","Kyle","What the hell?  Ike?
"
"12","12","Stan","Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
"
"12","13","Stan","What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
"
"12","13","Cartman","There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
"12","13","Kyle","They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
"12","13","Kyle","I swear
"
"12","13","Stan","Uh, Wendy?
"
"12","13","Stan","It is?
"
"12","13","Stan","Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
"
"12","13","Stan","Basketball?
"
"12","13","Stan","No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
"
"12","13","Kyle","You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
"12","13","Cartman","Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
"12","13","Stan","Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
"
"12","13","Stan","Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
"
"12","13","Cartman","Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
"12","13","Stan","But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
"
"12","14","Stan","What?
"
"12","14","Butters","Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
"12","14","Kyle","Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
"12","14","Cartman","All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
"12","14","Butters","All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
"12","14","Butters","Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
"12","14","Butters","Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
"12","14","Butters","I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
"12","14","Cartman","Dude! 
"
"12","14","Cartman","Yes.
"
"12","14","Butters","What's that, Dad?
"
"13","1","Cartman","Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
"13","1","Stan","Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
"
"13","1","Cartman","He took it pretty well.
"
"13","1","Stan","Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
"
"13","1","Butters","Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
"13","1","Kyle","Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
"13","1","Kyle","Yup, he's in here. 
"
"13","1","Stan","Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
"
"13","1","Stan","You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
"
"13","1","Cartman","Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
"13","2","Kyle","Why do you care?
"
"13","2","Cartman","And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
"13","2","Cartman","Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
"13","2","Cartman","I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
"13","2","Cartman","What?!
"
"13","2","Cartman","So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
"13","2","Stan","Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
"
"13","2","Kyle","Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
"
"13","3","Stan","Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
"
"13","3","Randy","Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
"
"13","3","Kyle","Well this sucks!
"
"13","3","Cartman","Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
"13","3","Kyle","Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
"
"13","3","Randy","I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
"
"13","3","Kyle","Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
"
"13","3","Randy","That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
"
"13","3","Cartman","Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
"13","3","Randy","But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
"
"13","4","Kyle","Come on guys, we gotta go! 
"
"13","4","Cartman","Let's get to my house!! 
"
"13","4","Butters","This is gonna be great!
"
"13","4","Cartman","Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
"13","4","Butters","Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
"
"13","4","Cartman","No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
"13","4","Randy","Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
"
"13","4","Stan","It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
"
"13","4","Randy","Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
"
"13","4","Stan","Stop it, Mom!
"
"13","4","Randy","Sharon! Marsh!
"
"13","4","Randy","That's completely different!
"
"13","4","Stan","On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
"
"13","4","Stan","No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
"
"13","4","Randy","HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
"
"13","4","Cartman","It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
"13","4","Mr. Garrison","They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
"
"13","5","Cartman","Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
"13","5","Cartman","Meh. 
"
"13","5","Cartman","What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
"13","5","Cartman","What are you?
"
"13","5","Cartman","Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
"13","5","Kyle","What?
"
"13","5","Cartman","Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
"13","5","Cartman","Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
"13","5","Cartman","It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
"13","5","Cartman","Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
"13","5","Cartman","Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
"13","5","Cartman","Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
"13","5","Cartman","Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
"13","5","Cartman","That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
"
"13","5","Cartman","Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
"
"13","6","Stan","It's uh, Marsh. 
"
"13","6","Randy","One point five?
"
"13","6","Randy","Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
"
"13","6","Stan","Alien?
"
"13","6","Randy","Hullo?
"
"13","6","Stan","Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
"
"13","6","Randy","What?! 
"
"13","6","Randy","That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
"
"13","6","Stan","Dad? 
"
"13","6","Randy","You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
"
"13","6","Mr. Garrison","He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
"
"13","6","Randy","Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
"
"13","6","Randy","Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
"
"13","6","Randy","Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
"
"13","6","Stan","The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
"
"13","6","Randy","Yeah, no, we've told you everything.
"
"13","6","Randy","It was... a trick?
"
"13","7","Cartman","You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
"13","7","Kyle","No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
"13","7","Cartman","Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
"
"13","7","Cartman","We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
"
"13","7","Butters","Neato!
"
"13","7","Cartman","That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
"
"13","7","Butters","It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
"13","7","Cartman","Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 
"
"13","7","Cartman","I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"
"13","7","Cartman","Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"
"13","7","Cartman","Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
"
"13","7","Cartman","Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
"
"13","7","Cartman","Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
"
"13","7","Kyle","Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
"13","7","Stan","You really think he'll die in Somalia?
"
"13","7","Kyle","Oh God. What have I done?
"
"13","7","Cartman","The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
"
"13","7","Butters","Have a good day! 
"
"13","7","Cartman","Better! With a yo ho ho!
"
"13","7","Cartman","Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
"
"13","7","Cartman","Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
"
"13","7","Kyle","No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"
"13","7","Butters","Huh?
"
"13","7","Kyle","Cartman, knock it off!
"
"13","7","Cartman","Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
"
"13","8","Cartman","Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
"
"13","8","Cartman","Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
"
"13","8","Kyle","It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
"13","8","Stan","Uh oh.
"
"13","8","Stan","Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
"
"13","8","Kyle","What the hell are we going to do??
"
"13","8","Kyle","Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
"
"13","8","Kyle","And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
"
"13","8","Cartman","God I hope this works.
"
"13","8","Kyle","Aww crap!
"
"13","8","Kyle","Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
"13","8","Cartman","Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
"
"13","8","Cartman","What if you didn't have to give it up?
"
"13","8","Kyle","Yeah!
"
"13","8","Kyle","Ike!  Ike, you're back!
"
"13","9","Stan","Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
"
"13","9","Cartman","Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
"
"13","9","Butters","So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
"13","9","Butters","Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
"
"13","9","Butters","Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
"13","9","Butters","We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
"13","9","Butters","Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
"
"13","9","Butters","Sure, Kyle.
"
"13","9","Kyle","Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
"
"13","9","Butters","Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
"13","9","Butters","In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
"13","9","Butters","Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
"13","9","Butters","Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
"13","10","Cartman","This is awesome!
"
"13","10","Stan","Why did they have us put on long underwear.
"
"13","10","Cartman","You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
"13","10","Cartman","That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
"13","10","Cartman","Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
"13","10","Cartman","Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
"13","10","Stan","You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
"
"13","10","Cartman","And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
"13","10","Cartman","I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
"13","10","Cartman","Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
"13","10","Stan","Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
"
"13","10","Cartman","""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
"13","10","Kyle","Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
"13","10","Butters","Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
"13","10","Kyle","I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
"13","10","Kyle","Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
"13","10","Cartman","Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
"13","10","Stan","And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
"
"13","10","Kyle","So what do we do?
"
"13","10","Cartman","Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
"13","10","Cartman","Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
"13","10","Stan","Yeah yeah, not bad.
"
"13","10","Cartman","Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
"13","10","Cartman","You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
"13","10","Butters","Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
"13","11","Stan","Dad, why did they do that?
"
"13","11","Cartman","Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
"13","11","Kyle","Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
"13","11","Stan","So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
"
"13","11","Stan","Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
"
"13","11","Stan","...No, I don't care about the show.
"
"13","11","Stan","Oh no, no, NO.
"
"13","11","Cartman","What dude?
"
"13","11","Stan","What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
"
"13","11","Stan","Dude, fuck you!
"
"13","11","Stan","Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
"13","11","Stan","Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
"
"13","12","Kyle","This... is exactly what I needed.
"
"13","12","Cartman","Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
"
"13","12","Cartman","But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
"13","12","Stan","...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
"
"13","12","Stan","Oh that's good.
"
"13","12","Cartman","Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
"
"13","12","Kyle","Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
"13","12","Stan","Yeah, we did that!
"
"13","12","Stan","Then you're not a fag.
"
"13","12","Stan","""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
"
"13","12","Stan","That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
"
"13","12","Cartman","Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
"13","12","Stan","Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
"
"13","12","Butters","That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
"13","12","Cartman","Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
"
"13","13","Cartman","But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
"
"13","13","Cartman","Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
"13","13","Kyle","Oh God, no! 
"
"13","13","Butters","It is true!
"
"13","13","Cartman","Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
"
"13","13","Butters","Cool, thanks.
"
"13","13","Stan","Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
"
"13","13","Butters","That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
"13","13","Butters","Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
"13","13","Butters","All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
"13","13","Cartman","Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
"13","13","Kyle","Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
"13","14","Cartman","No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
"13","14","Kyle","No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
"13","14","Stan","Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
"
"13","14","Kyle","Dude!
"
"13","14","Stan","Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
"
"13","14","Stan","After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
"
"13","14","Stan","Dude, where have you been?
"
"13","14","Cartman","I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
"13","14","Cartman","The black and brown people.
"
"13","14","Cartman","The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
"13","14","Kyle","Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
"13","14","Stan","This is sweet, huh Kenny? 
"
"13","14","Butters","Come on, Kyle!
"
"13","14","Kyle","Dude, that's all pee!
"
"13","14","Stan","Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
"
"13","14","Kyle","...What?!
"
"13","14","Stan","Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
"
"13","14","Stan","Kyle, come on!
"
"13","14","Cartman","Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
"13","14","Kyle","Oh who pees in the shower?
"
"13","14","Stan","...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
"
"13","14","Cartman","I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
"13","14","Cartman","Well, I do just as much work.
"
"13","14","Cartman","Noooo...
"
"13","14","Kyle","Let's just get this over with!
"
"13","14","Kyle","Why?!
"
"13","14","Randy","Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
"
"13","14","Randy","Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
"
"13","14","Kyle","Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"
"13","14","Kyle","AAAAAAAA!
"
"14","1","Cartman","Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
"14","1","Butters","It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
"
"14","1","Kyle","So what happens to us now?
"
"14","1","Butters","Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"
"14","1","Kyle","Oh God, it's true.
"
"14","1","Cartman","Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
"14","1","Butters","Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
"
"14","1","Kyle","I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
"
"14","1","Kyle","What bastard?
"
"14","2","Mr. Garrison","Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
"
"14","2","Mr. Garrison","...and strong vulgar language...
"
"14","2","Cartman","No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
"14","2","Cartman","They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
"14","2","Kyle","Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
"
"14","2","Randy","Read what?
"
"14","2","Randy","""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!
"
"14","2","Randy","""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-""  ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man.
"
"14","2","Randy","NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
"
"14","2","Butters","I am?
"
"14","2","Cartman","Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
"14","2","Butters","Huh?
"
"14","2","Kyle","What? 
"
"14","2","Kyle","Yeah, we wrote that!
"
"14","2","Butters","Thank you! 
"
"14","2","Cartman","Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
"14","2","Butters","But, you told me I did!
"
"14","2","Stan","God-damnit!
"
"14","2","Butters","Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
"
"14","2","Kyle","The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
"
"14","2","Butters","Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
"
"14","2","Kyle","Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
"
"14","2","Cartman","Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
"14","2","Stan","So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
"
"14","2","Stan","Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
"
"14","2","Cartman","People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
"14","2","Stan","You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"
"14","2","Stan","God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
"
"14","2","Cartman","Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
"14","2","Butters","You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"
"14","2","Kyle","Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"
"14","2","Stan","Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
"
"14","3","Cartman","KFC!! 
"
"14","3","Randy","Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
"
"14","3","Randy","Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
"
"14","3","Randy","I gotta get to the doctor! 
"
"14","3","Randy","That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
"
"14","3","Randy","...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
"
"14","3","Cartman","You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
"14","3","Cartman","I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
"14","3","Cartman","Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
"14","3","Cartman","Are you Teabag?
"
"14","3","Cartman","You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
"14","3","Cartman","Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
"14","3","Randy","See?
"
"14","3","Cartman","Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
"14","3","Cartman","I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
"14","3","Randy","Hey. My eyes are up here.
"
"14","3","Randy","What do we want?
"
"14","3","Randy","Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
"
"14","4","Randy","Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
"
"14","4","Stan","...Dad, you are my friend.
"
"14","4","Randy","Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
"
"14","4","Stan","Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
"
"14","4","Stan","...Um, no?
"
"14","4","Stan","Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
"
"14","4","Kyle","I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
"
"14","4","Stan","Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
"
"14","4","Kyle","You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"
"14","4","Stan","Ah fuck.
"
"14","4","Randy","Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
"
"14","4","Stan","No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! 
"
"14","4","Stan","Profile? I'm not a profile.
"
"14","4","Cartman","Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
"14","4","Cartman","Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
"14","4","Cartman","Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
"14","4","Cartman","Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
"14","4","Stan","Okay I'll be your friend.
"
"14","4","Stan","Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
"
"14","4","Cartman","Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
"14","4","Kyle","Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"
"14","4","Kyle","...What?
"
"14","4","Stan","What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
"
"14","4","Kyle","Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
"
"14","4","Stan","Dude! Fuck your crops! 
"
"14","4","Kyle","An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
"
"14","4","Stan","Jesus Christ.
"
"14","4","Stan","Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
"
"14","4","Kyle","What? Why?
"
"14","4","Stan","Oh...
"
"14","4","Stan","Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
"
"14","4","Randy","Yahtzee!
"
"14","5","Cartman","AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
"14","5","Stan","You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
"
"14","5","Randy","You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
"
"14","5","Randy","Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
"
"14","5","Randy","ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
"
"14","5","Stan","I saw him once. 
"
"14","5","Stan","Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
"
"14","5","Mr. Garrison","No, don't!  Is that okay to show?
"
"14","5","Cartman","Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
"14","5","Cartman","Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
"14","5","Cartman","Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
"14","5","Cartman","Yeah, so what?
"
"14","5","Randy","Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
"
"14","5","Kyle","But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
"
"14","5","Cartman","God, will somebody shut her up?
"
"14","5","Stan","They want his power?
"
"14","5","Randy","Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
"
"14","6","Cartman","That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
"14","6","Mr. Garrison","All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
"
"14","6","Randy","Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
"
"14","6","Stan","Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
"
"14","6","Cartman","Nice work, Conner.
"
"14","6","Randy","Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
"
"14","6","Kyle","Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
"14","6","Stan","The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
"
"14","6","Kyle","I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
"
"14","6","Cartman","I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
"14","6","Cartman","Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
"14","6","Cartman","Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
"14","6","Stan","Yeah.
"
"14","6","Cartman","Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
"14","6","Kyle","Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
"14","6","Stan","We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
"
"14","7","Kyle","If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
"14","7","Stan","We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
"
"14","7","Butters","Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
"
"14","7","Kyle","Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
"14","7","Kyle","We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
"14","7","Butters","You will?
"
"14","8","Cartman","It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
"14","8","Stan","Cartman, tell us.
"
"14","8","Cartman","No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
"14","8","Stan","Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
"
"14","8","Cartman","Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
"14","8","Cartman","You love NASCAR huh?
"
"14","8","Stan","Dude, you are so retarded!
"
"14","8","Cartman","Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
"14","8","Cartman","Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
"14","8","Butters","But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
"
"14","8","Cartman","Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
"14","8","Butters","Really?
"
"14","8","Cartman","Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
"14","8","Cartman","Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
"14","8","Cartman","What's that?
"
"14","8","Butters","Well at least there's that.
"
"14","8","Cartman","Aw donkey balls...
"
"14","8","Cartman","Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
"14","8","Cartman","Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
"14","8","Butters","Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
"
"14","8","Cartman","Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
"14","9","Kyle","Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
"14","9","Stan","You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
"
"14","9","Cartman","You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
"14","9","Kyle","Hey, dudes.
"
"14","9","Kyle","No, it doesn't!
"
"14","9","Kyle","Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
"14","9","Stan","Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
"
"14","9","Stan","Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
"
"14","9","Kyle","Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
"
"14","9","Cartman","Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
"14","9","Randy","People from Jersey?
"
"14","9","Kyle","You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
"14","9","Kyle","All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
"14","9","Randy","What does that mean?!
"
"14","9","Randy","This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
"
"14","9","Stan","Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
"
"14","9","Kyle","Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
"14","9","Stan","I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?
"
"14","10","Stan","Are you serious?
"
"14","10","Stan","Yeah, alright.
"
"14","10","Stan","Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
"
"14","10","Kyle","Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
"14","10","Stan","I don't... I don't know.
"
"14","10","Stan","Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
"
"14","10","Stan","Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
"
"14","10","Stan","I think I have a better idea.
"
"14","10","Kyle","How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
"14","11","Cartman","Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
"14","11","Cartman","...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
"14","11","Cartman","Asshoooles! 
"
"14","14","Randy","Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
"
"14","14","Randy","Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
"
"14","14","Kyle","Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
"14","14","Randy","Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
"
"14","14","Randy","I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
"
"14","14","Randy","Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
"
"14","14","Randy","If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
"
"14","14","Randy","WAH! Sharon!
"
"14","14","Stan","Awww what?!
"
"14","14","Randy","The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
"
"14","14","Randy","Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
"
"14","14","Stan","Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
"
"14","14","Stan","Dad, what are you doing?
"
"14","14","Kyle","We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
"14","14","Stan","He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
"
"14","14","Cartman","Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
"14","14","Randy","Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
"
"14","14","Randy","Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!
"
"15","1","Cartman","YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
"15","1","Kyle","Hey! You can't do that! 
"
"15","1","Kyle","You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
"
"15","1","Stan","What?
"
"15","1","Butters","You didn't read them?
"
"15","1","Kyle","Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
"
"15","1","Stan","I do.
"
"15","1","Butters","Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
"
"15","1","Kyle","Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
"
"15","1","Cartman","Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
"15","1","Cartman","Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
"15","1","Cartman","But I told you I was sorry.
"
"15","1","Cartman","Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
"15","1","Kyle","What is this? What's going on?
"
"15","1","Kyle","Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
"
"15","1","Butters","Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user""
"
"15","1","Kyle","(You're fine!)
"
"15","1","Cartman","Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
"15","1","Cartman","Uh huh.
"
"15","1","Cartman","Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
"15","1","Stan","Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
"
"15","1","Stan","Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
"
"15","1","Cartman","Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
"15","2","Kyle","A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
"
"15","2","Cartman","Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
"15","2","Cartman","Well, I tried.
"
"15","2","Stan","Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
"
"15","2","Butters","Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"
"15","2","Kyle","Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
"
"15","2","Stan","We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
"
"15","2","Cartman","Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
"15","2","Stan","Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
"15","4","Stan","No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
"
"15","4","Kyle","You get in trouble again, Cartman?
"
"15","4","Kyle","No they didn't.
"
"15","4","Cartman","Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
"15","4","Kyle","Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
"
"15","4","Cartman","Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
"15","4","Butters","Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
"
"15","4","Cartman","Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
"15","4","Butters","I'm hung like a horse!
"
"15","4","Cartman","What, Kyle?
"
"15","4","Cartman","For what?!
"
"15","4","Cartman","You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
"15","4","Cartman","I don't know! Why would you?!
"
"15","4","Cartman","Fuck you! No I don't!
"
"15","4","Cartman","Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
"15","4","Randy","Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
"
"15","4","Randy","No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
"
"15","4","Cartman","No, and fuck Kyle!
"
"15","4","Butters","Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
"
"15","4","Randy","We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
"
"15","5","Kyle","Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
"
"15","5","Kyle","What are you doing here?
"
"15","5","Cartman","Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
"15","5","Cartman","Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
"15","5","Kyle","There's a big wait to sit down.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Come on. 
"
"15","5","Cartman","Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
"15","5","Butters","I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
"
"15","5","Cartman","We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
"15","5","Cartman","Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
"15","5","Cartman","Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
"15","5","Cartman","A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
"15","5","Cartman","Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
"15","5","Cartman","Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
"15","5","Cartman","You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
"15","5","Cartman","How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
"15","5","Cartman","...What?
"
"15","5","Cartman","Vunter Slash?
"
"15","5","Cartman","Are you fucking serious? 
"
"15","5","Kyle","It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
"
"15","5","Stan","It's what?
"
"15","5","Kyle","You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
"
"15","5","Stan","Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
"
"15","6","Butters","Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. 
"
"15","6","Butters","Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
"
"15","6","Butters","Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
"
"15","6","Butters","Sure.
"
"15","6","Butters","Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
"
"15","6","Butters","What? Why would I do that?
"
"15","6","Butters","Really?
"
"15","6","Butters","Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
"
"15","6","Butters","Huh?
"
"15","7","Butters","Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
"
"15","7","Cartman","Yaaaay!
"
"15","7","Kyle","Oh God...
"
"15","7","Stan","Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
"
"15","7","Cartman","Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
"15","7","Kyle","Yeah they're the best!
"
"15","7","Cartman","Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
"15","7","Kyle","Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
"
"15","7","Kyle","What's that?
"
"15","7","Stan","Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
"
"15","7","Kyle","You don't wanna eat it?
"
"15","7","Stan","It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
"
"15","7","Cartman","Look like ice cream to me.
"
"15","7","Randy","City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
"
"15","7","Randy","Yoyoyo! 
"
"15","7","Stan","Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
"
"15","7","Kyle","No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
"
"15","7","Stan","Where were you guys going?!
"
"15","7","Kyle","Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
"
"15","7","Stan","Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
"
"15","7","Stan","How can you say that looks good?!
"
"15","7","Kyle","Dude, you've... you've changed.
"
"15","7","Stan","I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
"
"15","7","Randy","Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
"
"15","8","Kyle","Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
"
"15","8","Kyle","Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
"
"15","8","Kyle","You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
"
"15","8","Butters","Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
"
"15","8","Cartman","Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
"15","8","Cartman","I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
"15","8","Cartman","What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
"15","8","Cartman","Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
"15","8","Kyle","Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
"
"15","8","Stan","Adam Sandler's funny.
"
"15","8","Stan","The rock creatures?
"
"15","8","Stan","Ugh God.
"
"15","8","Stan","Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
"
"15","8","Stan","Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
"
"15","8","Stan","I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
"
"15","8","Randy","Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
"
"15","8","Stan","No, dad, no. No, please!
"
"15","8","Kyle","Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
"
"15","9","Cartman","He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
"15","9","Stan","Base! 
"
"15","9","Cartman","Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
"15","9","Cartman","Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
"15","9","Cartman","All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
"15","9","Butters","Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work
"
"15","9","Butters","All week long, bossman say
"
"15","9","Butters","Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
"
"15","9","Kyle","Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
"
"15","9","Butters","Wow.
"
"15","9","Cartman","This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
"15","9","Cartman","Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
"15","9","Butters","Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
"
"15","9","Cartman","No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
"15","9","Cartman","That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
"15","9","Butters","Giddy up! 
"
"15","9","Cartman","Ey!
"
"15","9","Cartman","NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
"15","9","Cartman","I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
"15","10","Cartman","YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
"15","10","Stan","What about him?
"
"15","10","Cartman","He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
"15","10","Butters","Eavesdropper?
"
"15","10","Kyle","What's that?
"
"15","10","Butters","Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
"
"15","10","Cartman","Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
"15","10","Cartman","Yeah, he killed himself.
"
"15","10","Butters","It's megasuperhilarious! 
"
"15","10","Cartman","Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
"15","10","Cartman","I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
"15","10","Cartman","You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
"15","10","Cartman","Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
"15","10","Stan","No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
"
"15","10","Kyle","So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
"
"15","10","Stan","Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
"
"15","10","Kyle","Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
"
"15","10","Stan","Oh I'm ready!
"
"15","10","Stan","What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
"
"15","10","Stan","Knock it off! 
"
"15","10","Cartman","It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
"15","10","Cartman","No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
"15","10","Stan","Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
"
"15","10","Stan","Quick, we need something to carry him in!
"
"15","10","Stan","Whoa whoa wait, wait! 
"
"15","10","Stan","Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
"15","11","Randy","A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
"
"15","11","Randy","Can I get a scotch and soda? 
"
"15","11","Randy","Subliminal messages?
"
"15","11","Randy","Really??
"
"15","11","Stan","No. Dad. Please don't do this!
"
"15","11","Randy","Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
"
"15","11","Randy","Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
"
"15","11","Randy","Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
"
"15","11","Randy","Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
"
"15","11","Randy","I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
"
"15","11","Randy","Sup brah?!
"
"15","11","Randy","What brah?!
"
"15","11","Randy","I do respect you, bro!
"
"15","11","Randy","Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
"
"15","11","Randy","Okay. What's Shelly doing?
"
"15","11","Randy","AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!
"
"15","11","Randy","I can't!
"
"15","11","Randy","And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?
"
"15","11","Randy","AAAA!
"
"15","11","Randy","Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
"
"15","11","Randy","It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
"
"15","11","Randy","Agh! 
"
"15","12","Cartman","Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
"15","12","Stan","Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
"
"15","12","Cartman","What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
"15","12","Stan","Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
"
"15","12","Cartman","Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
"15","12","Cartman","No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
"15","12","Cartman","How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
"15","12","Stan","Yeah.
"
"15","12","Cartman","Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
"15","12","Cartman","Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
"15","12","Cartman","Oh sure!
"
"15","12","Stan","Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
"15","12","Cartman","I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
"15","12","Cartman","Who did this to you?!
"
"15","12","Cartman","Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
"15","12","Kyle","We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
"
"15","13","Cartman","Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
"15","13","Kyle","Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
"
"15","13","Kyle","How is that gonna help?!
"
"15","13","Cartman","Uh-huh??
"
"15","13","Kyle","Dude!
"
"15","13","Stan","...What?
"
"15","13","Cartman","Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
"15","13","Cartman","Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
"15","14","Cartman","Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
"15","14","Kyle","Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
"
"15","14","Stan","We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
"
"15","14","Cartman","Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
"15","14","Cartman","Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
"15","14","Cartman","Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
"15","14","Cartman","Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
"15","14","Cartman","We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
"15","14","Cartman","Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
"15","14","Cartman","Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
"15","14","Cartman","I was just teasing.
"
"15","14","Cartman","Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
"15","14","Stan","Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
"
"15","14","Kyle","How was jail, fatass?!
"
"16","1","Stan","Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
"
"16","1","Cartman","Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
"16","1","Cartman","I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
"16","1","Kyle","That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
"16","1","Cartman","They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
"16","1","Kyle","All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
"16","1","Stan","Wow, really?!
"
"16","1","Kyle","Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
"
"16","1","Cartman","This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
"16","1","Randy","Aw, you people have me on camera now?
"
"16","1","Cartman","Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
"16","1","Mr. Garrison","Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 
"
"16","1","Cartman","Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
"16","1","Stan","So what does that mean?
"
"16","1","Cartman","Yeah.
"
"16","1","Cartman","Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
"16","2","Randy","Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
"
"16","2","Randy","Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
"
"16","2","Stan","...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
"
"16","2","Kyle","You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"
"16","2","Kyle","...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
"16","2","Cartman","Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
"16","2","Stan","Grandpa.
"
"16","2","Stan","Yes, Grandpa.
"
"16","2","Butters","Whoops! 
"
"16","2","Cartman","""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
"16","2","Butters","We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
"
"16","2","Cartman","Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
"16","2","Cartman","And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
"16","2","Cartman","Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
"16","2","Cartman","You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
"16","2","Butters","Sorry! 
"
"16","2","Cartman","No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
"16","3","Stan","Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
"
"16","3","Butters","Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
"
"16","3","Kyle","Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
"16","3","Cartman","Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
"16","3","Cartman","Really? 
"
"16","3","Kyle","How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
"16","3","Stan","""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""
"
"16","3","Cartman","Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
"16","3","Cartman","How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
"16","3","Stan","That's a cool idea
"
"16","3","Stan","Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
"16","3","Kyle","We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
"16","3","Kyle","Kenny?
"
"16","3","Kyle","You're freaking sellouts!
"
"16","3","Cartman","I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
"16","3","Cartman","Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
"16","3","Stan","Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
"
"16","4","Cartman","Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
"16","4","Cartman","Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
"16","4","Kyle","What are you gonna do?
"
"16","4","Cartman","Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
"16","4","Cartman","Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
"16","4","Cartman","Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
"16","4","Butters","You think Jewpacabra is here?
"
"16","4","Cartman","You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
"16","4","Butters","Eric, stop it!
"
"16","4","Cartman","Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
"16","4","Butters","Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"
"16","4","Cartman","People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
"16","4","Cartman","It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
"16","4","Cartman","There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
"16","4","Cartman","Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
"16","4","Butters","Hey, Eric.
"
"16","4","Cartman","Wingstreet?!
"
"16","4","Cartman","Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
"16","4","Cartman","NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
"16","4","Cartman","Ugh... what... where...
"
"16","4","Kyle","Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
"16","4","Kyle","It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
"
"16","4","Cartman","Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
"16","4","Cartman","And our love grows
"
"16","4","Cartman","Noooo! 
"
"16","4","Cartman","No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
"16","4","Kyle","I know, you're not.
"
"16","5","Stan","Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
"
"16","5","Cartman","I have balls.
"
"16","5","Butters","Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
"
"16","5","Stan","Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
"
"16","5","Butters","Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
"
"16","5","Kyle","Why are you doing this, Stan?
"
"16","5","Stan","To stop bullying.
"
"16","5","Kyle","Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"
"16","5","Stan","Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
"
"16","5","Stan","Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
"
"16","5","Stan","Oh, hey.
"
"16","5","Stan","No.
"
"16","5","Kyle","I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
"
"16","5","Stan","What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
"
"16","5","Kyle","What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
"16","5","Stan","Oh yeah.
"
"16","5","Kyle","If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
"16","5","Stan","...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
"
"16","5","Butters","Please, leave me alone.
"
"16","6","Stan","Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
"
"16","6","Stan","We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
"
"16","6","Cartman","Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
"16","6","Kyle","And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
"16","6","Cartman","Alright!
"
"16","6","Stan","It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
"
"16","6","Stan","...Shuttle?
"
"16","6","Stan","Uh that's okay.
"
"16","6","Cartman","Mmmm, no?
"
"16","6","Kyle","Wugh!
"
"16","6","Cartman","We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
"16","6","Stan","That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
"
"16","6","Stan","Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
"
"16","6","Kyle","The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
"16","6","Kyle","Oh, thank God!
"
"16","6","Stan","You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
"
"16","6","Kyle","Just go. Go without me.
"
"16","6","Stan","No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
"
"16","6","Kyle","Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
"16","6","Cartman","Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
"16","6","Kyle","I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
"16","6","Kyle","Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
"16","6","Kyle","You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
"
"16","6","Kyle","Mr. Hankey!
"
"16","6","Stan","Thank you.  Mr. Hankey. 
"
"16","7","Cartman","Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
"16","7","Cartman","Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
"16","7","Cartman","Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
"16","7","Cartman","Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
"16","7","Kyle","Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
"16","7","Cartman","Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
"16","7","Kyle","Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
"16","7","Cartman","Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
"16","7","Cartman","Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
"16","7","Cartman","Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
"16","7","Cartman","Nothing.
"
"16","7","Cartman","Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
"16","7","Cartman","You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
"16","7","Cartman","Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
"16","7","Kyle","What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
"16","7","Kyle","Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
"16","7","Cartman","Nooooooo!
"
"16","7","Cartman","No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
"16","7","Cartman","I swear, Kyle. 
"
"16","8","Randy","That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
"
"16","8","Randy","Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
"
"16","8","Randy","Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
"
"16","8","Randy","Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
"
"16","8","Randy","Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
"
"16","8","Butters","Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
"16","8","Kyle","We don't even understand how this game is played.
"
"16","8","Cartman","That's true.
"
"16","8","Butters","And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
"16","8","Randy","Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
"
"16","8","Cartman","Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
"16","8","Butters","'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
"16","8","Kyle","We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
"16","8","Randy","Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
"
"16","8","Cartman","Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
"16","8","Butters","Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
"16","8","Cartman","...I don't have a dad.
"
"16","8","Butters","My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
"16","8","Cartman","Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
"16","8","Randy","Thanks Jim. 
"
"16","8","Randy","Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
"
"16","8","Randy","My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
"
"16","8","Cartman","That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
"16","8","Randy","... This is cum. 
"
"16","9","Cartman","Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
"16","9","Cartman","Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
"16","9","Cartman","Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
"16","9","Cartman","Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
"16","9","Kyle","You have got to be kidding me!
"
"16","9","Kyle","Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
"16","9","Stan","Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
"
"16","9","Kyle","Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
"16","9","Stan","Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
"
"16","9","Kyle","Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
"16","9","Kyle","Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
"16","9","Kyle","When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
"16","9","Cartman","It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
"16","9","Kyle","You found a network to buy it?
"
"16","9","Cartman","What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
"16","10","Kyle","Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
"
"16","10","Kyle","Yeah dude. 
"
"16","10","Stan","But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? 
"
"16","10","Cartman","Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
"16","10","Cartman","Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
"16","10","Randy","Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
"
"16","10","Cartman","You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
"16","10","Cartman","He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
"16","10","Cartman","A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
"16","10","Cartman","No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
"16","10","Cartman","Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
"16","10","Kyle","It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
"16","10","Stan","You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
"
"16","10","Kyle","Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
"16","10","Randy","And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
"
"16","10","Randy","This guy doesn't know when to quit!
"
"16","10","Kyle","And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
"16","10","Kyle","You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
"16","10","Kyle","Dude, come down here!
"
"16","10","Cartman","It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
"16","11","Cartman","It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
"16","11","Stan","Butters, come out here.
"
"16","11","Butters","I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"
"16","11","Stan","Hawaii?
"
"16","11","Cartman","He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
"16","11","Butters","What's ""saimin""?
"
"16","11","Stan","""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
"
"16","11","Butters","Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
"16","11","Butters","Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
"16","12","Randy","You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
"
"16","12","Stan","Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
"
"16","12","Randy","Shelly come on!
"
"16","12","Randy","How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
"
"16","12","Randy","Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
"
"16","12","Randy","I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
"
"16","12","Stan","I think something might be wrong with Dad?
"
"16","12","Stan","Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
"
"16","12","Stan","Dad, nobody's gonna come.
"
"16","12","Randy","Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
"
"16","12","Kyle","Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
"16","12","Stan","I know, but there's nothing I can do.
"
"16","12","Kyle","We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
"16","12","Stan","What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
"
"16","12","Randy","Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
"
"16","12","Mr. Garrison","There's who? 
"
"16","12","Randy","Haarrrr! 
"
"16","12","Butters","Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
"
"16","12","Kyle","Stan?
"
"16","12","Stan","Hey dude.
"
"16","12","Stan","Stay gold. 
"
"16","12","Randy","No...
"
"16","12","Randy","Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
"
"16","13","Cartman","I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
"16","13","Stan","It's all right, Dad.
"
"16","13","Stan","Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
"
"16","13","Stan","Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
"
"16","13","Stan","And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
"
"16","13","Butters","Prostitute!
"
"16","13","Stan","What are you doing here?
"
"16","13","Stan","Pff it's like, that's here  and...
"
"16","13","Stan","How can we raise awareness?
"
"16","13","Cartman","Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
"16","13","Butters","Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
"16","13","Kyle","Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"
"16","13","Stan","Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
"
"16","14","Cartman","Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
"16","14","Cartman","She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
"16","14","Cartman","Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
"16","14","Cartman","MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
"16","14","Cartman","Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
"16","14","Cartman","Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
"16","14","Cartman","What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
"16","14","Cartman","Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
"16","14","Cartman","Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
"16","14","Kyle","But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
"16","14","Kyle","Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
"
"16","14","Stan","Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
"
"16","14","Butters","Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
"
"16","14","Kyle","What did Cartman tell you?!
"
"16","14","Butters","It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
"
"16","14","Kyle","Then you have to tell us!
"
"16","14","Cartman","Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
"16","14","Butters","What's up fellas?
"
"16","14","Kyle","Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
"
"16","14","Butters","Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
"16","14","Butters","Red Lobster!
"
"16","14","Kyle","All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
"
"16","14","Cartman","Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
"16","14","Stan","There's nothing here, Kyle. 
"
"16","14","Kyle","Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
"
"16","14","Stan","Aw shit, it's him again.
"
"16","14","Kyle","It matters, Stan. It it matters.
"
"16","14","Kyle","Look! There they are!
"
"17","1","Kyle","AAAARGH!
"
"17","1","Cartman","Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
"17","1","Cartman","Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
"17","1","Cartman","See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
"17","1","Kyle","Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
"
"17","1","Butters","Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
"17","1","Cartman","Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
"
"17","1","Cartman","What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
"17","1","Kyle","What the hell are you doing?!
"
"17","1","Butters","Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?
"
"17","1","Butters","Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
"17","1","Butters","You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
"17","1","Butters","Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
"17","1","Butters","I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
"17","1","Butters","Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
"17","1","Cartman","It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
"17","1","Butters","Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
"17","1","Cartman","For everything bad I've ever done?
"
"17","1","Butters","That's right.
"
"17","1","Cartman","I do, I love my country!
"
"17","1","Butters","Hallelujah!
"
"17","2","Randy","...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
"
"17","2","Stan","Okaaay. 
"
"17","2","Stan","...What?!
"
"17","2","Randy","What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
"
"17","2","Randy","NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
"
"17","2","Randy","Will do, officer. Will... do... 
"
"17","2","Stan","It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
"
"17","2","Stan","Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
"
"17","2","Stan","So?
"
"17","2","Cartman","You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
"17","2","Stan","We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"
"17","2","Randy","Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
"
"17","2","Randy","Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
"
"17","2","Randy","Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
"
"17","2","Randy","Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
"
"17","2","Randy","Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
"
"17","3","Cartman","God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
"
"17","3","Cartman","It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
"17","3","Cartman","No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
"
"17","3","Cartman","I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
"17","3","Cartman","Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
"17","3","Cartman","Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
"17","3","Cartman","Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
"17","3","Cartman","The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
"
"17","3","Cartman","Nah! 
"
"17","3","Butters","Yes.
"
"17","3","Cartman","Come on! 
"
"17","3","Cartman","Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
"17","3","Cartman","Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
"17","3","Cartman","Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
"
"17","3","Cartman","Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
"17","3","Cartman","You interrupt people when they talk.
"
"17","5","Cartman","That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
"17","5","Kyle","I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
"
"17","5","Kyle","Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
"
"17","5","Kyle","What?
"
"17","5","Kyle","What the fuck is going on?!
"
"17","5","Kyle","What??
"
"17","5","Kyle","Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
"17","5","Kyle","What?
"
"17","5","Kyle","Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
"
"17","5","Kyle","I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""
"
"17","5","Kyle","Yeah, I bet she does.
"
"17","6","Cartman","Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
"17","6","Kyle","Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
"
"17","6","Cartman","Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
"17","6","Kyle","Huh?
"
"17","6","Kyle","Wuwhat's going on?
"
"17","6","Kyle","He said they come on urgent business.
"
"17","6","Kyle","Yeah. 
"
"17","6","Kyle","Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
"
"17","6","Cartman","You what??
"
"17","6","Cartman","Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
"
"17","6","Kyle","Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
"17","6","Kyle","Because they taste so yummy. 
"
"17","6","Cartman","Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
"17","6","Cartman","I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"
"17","6","Cartman","Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
"17","6","Stan","Hey Kyle.
"
"17","6","Kyle","I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
"17","6","Stan","All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
"
"17","6","Kyle","All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
"
"17","6","Stan","I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"
"17","6","Kyle","Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
"17","6","Kyle","Dude! Do not do this!
"
"17","6","Stan","No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
"
"17","6","Kyle","Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
"
"17","6","Kyle","But it's the truth!
"
"17","7","Cartman","What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
"
"17","7","Butters","Woo, spooky.
"
"17","7","Cartman","They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
"17","7","Kyle","Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
"17","7","Randy","Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
"
"17","7","Kyle","Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
"17","7","Kyle","If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
"17","7","Cartman","Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
"17","7","Cartman","Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
"
"17","7","Cartman","Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
"17","7","Cartman","What new Elmo doll?
"
"17","7","Stan","Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"
"17","7","Stan","Exactly!
"
"17","7","Cartman","I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
"17","7","Stan","Did you ask the Vamp kids?
"
"17","7","Stan","So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
"
"17","7","Randy","No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
"
"17","7","Stan","When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
"
"17","8","Cartman","Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
"17","8","Butters","Yeah!
"
"17","8","Cartman","The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
"17","8","Cartman","Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
"17","8","Butters","They don't!
"
"17","8","Cartman","So what happens when the dragons show up?
"
"17","8","Butters","Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
"17","8","Cartman","He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
"17","8","Butters","Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"
"17","8","Butters","We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
"17","8","Butters","When?
"
"17","8","Butters","Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
"17","8","Kyle","If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
"17","8","Kyle","What?
"
"17","8","Cartman","Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
"17","8","Kyle","All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
"17","8","Stan","I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
"
"17","8","Cartman","You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
"17","8","Cartman","Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
"17","8","Cartman","Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
"17","8","Butters","Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
"17","9","Cartman","He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
"
"17","9","Cartman","Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
"17","9","Cartman","Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
"17","9","Kyle","Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
"17","9","Stan","So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
"
"17","9","Cartman","We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
"
"17","9","Stan","Yeah, sure, what about it?
"
"17","9","Cartman","I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
"17","9","Cartman","Dude! Dude!
"
"17","9","Cartman","God damn it, shut up!
"
"17","9","Stan","Did Kyle know about this?!
"
"17","9","Cartman","Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
"17","9","Butters","What's that?  Awww! 
"
"17","9","Cartman","Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
"17","9","Cartman","Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
"
"17","9","Cartman","What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
"
"17","9","Cartman","What the hell is this?!
"
"17","9","Cartman","No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
"17","9","Cartman","Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
"17","9","Kyle","Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
"
"17","10","Cartman","Uh oh.
"
"17","10","Butters","Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
"17","10","Butters","That's Lisa Berger?
"
"17","10","Butters","And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
"
"17","10","Cartman","I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
"
"17","10","Butters","What?! Well since when?
"
"17","10","Stan","Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"
"17","10","Stan","A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
"
"18","9","Kyle","Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
"18","9","Randy","Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
"
"18","9","Randy","I love Candy Crush.
"
"18","9","Stan","I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
"18","9","Cartman","Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
"18","9","Kyle","Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
"18","9","Randy","Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
"
"18","9","Randy","If she means that much to you.
"
"18","9","Kyle","Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
"18","9","Cartman","That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
"18","9","Kyle","Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
"18","9","Kyle","You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
"18","9","Kyle","Let's Plays?
"
"18","9","Randy","Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
"
"18","9","Randy","No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
"
"18","9","Kyle","You're not gonna believe this.
"
"18","9","Stan","Oh no, what now?
"
"18","9","Kyle","See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
"18","9","Stan","Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
"18","9","Stan","Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
"18","9","Randy","Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
"
"18","9","Cartman","CartmaaanBrah!
"
"18","9","Cartman","CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
"
"18","9","Randy","Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
"
"18","9","Randy","I was told to!
"
"18","9","Randy","Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
"
"18","9","Cartman","Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
"
"18","9","Mr. Garrison","Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
"18","9","Cartman","Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
"
"18","9","Mr. Garrison","What the hell?
"
"18","9","Butters","It's true!
"
"18","9","Kyle","THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
"18","9","Randy","They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
"
"18","1","Cartman","Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
"
"18","1","Randy","Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
"
"18","1","Stan","No, we don't wanna do anything.
"
"18","1","Randy","Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
"
"18","1","Stan","What?
"
"18","1","Cartman","It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
"18","1","Stan","I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
"
"18","1","Cartman","It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
"18","1","Kyle","Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
"
"18","1","Butters","One dollar pledge!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
"18","1","Kyle","People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
"
"18","1","Butters","Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
"
"18","1","Cartman","Goooood morning, guys!
"
"18","1","Butters","Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
"
"18","1","Butters","Somebody killed Kickstarter!
"
"18","1","Cartman","You song of a bitch!
"
"18","1","Cartman","Well, somebody did!
"
"18","1","Kyle","Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
"18","1","Kyle","When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
"18","1","Kyle","Change our name?
"
"18","1","Stan","But you all thought our name was sweet.
"
"18","2","Kyle","We were- trying to be funny.
"
"18","2","Mr. Garrison","I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
"
"18","2","Kyle","Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
"18","2","Kyle","No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
"18","2","Stan","What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
"
"18","2","Stan","Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
"
"18","2","Mr. Garrison","Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
"
"18","2","Randy","This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
"
"18","2","Randy","You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
"
"18","2","Cartman","KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
"18","2","Stan","We can't let our party suck.
"
"18","2","Cartman","What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
"18","2","Kyle","Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
"
"18","2","Randy","Gluten expohn... oh not here!
"
"18","2","Randy","How long do I have to stay here?!
"
"18","2","Randy","Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
"
"18","2","Stan","Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
"
"18","2","Stan","Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
"
"18","2","Randy","Staaaaaaan!
"
"18","2","Cartman","Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
"
"18","2","Randy","Are you crazy?
"
"18","2","Cartman","Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
"18","2","Stan","Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
"
"18","3","Cartman","Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
"18","3","Butters","Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
"
"18","3","Cartman","No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
"18","3","Cartman","Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
"18","3","Cartman","Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
"18","3","Mr. Garrison","Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
"
"18","3","Mr. Garrison","Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.
"
"18","3","Randy","...Yeah. I do.
"
"18","3","Cartman","Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
"18","3","Randy","You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
"
"18","3","Cartman","Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
"18","3","Randy","Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
"
"18","3","Randy","Oh really? About... about what?
"
"18","3","Stan","...What?
"
"18","3","Randy","Yah, that's my cover.
"
"18","3","Stan","Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
"
"18","3","Randy","Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  ""Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter.""  Stan?
"
"18","3","Butters","Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
"18","3","Cartman","Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
"18","3","Randy","With what?  With what? 
"
"18","4","Randy","Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
"
"18","4","Randy","All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
"
"18","4","Randy","Oooo! Booom!
"
"18","5","Cartman","You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
"18","5","Butters","My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
"18","5","Cartman","Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
"
"18","5","Cartman","Butters, is that you?
"
"18","5","Butters","Of course not!
"
"18","5","Cartman","It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
"18","5","Butters","I love you too, Dad. 
"
"18","5","Cartman","Not a word, Kenny!
"
"18","5","Stan","How'd you get that on your phone?
"
"18","5","Cartman","Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
"
"18","5","Butters","What the heck are you doing?!
"
"18","5","Cartman","Butters-
"
"18","5","Butters","Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
"18","5","Cartman","Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
"18","5","Cartman","Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
"18","5","Cartman","But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
"18","5","Randy","Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
"
"18","5","Randy","Okay.
"
"18","5","Randy","...Drones are spooky?
"
"18","5","Cartman","It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
"18","6","Kyle","Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
"
"18","6","Butters","Congratulations, Kyle.
"
"18","6","Cartman","I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
"
"18","6","Randy","You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
"
"18","6","Stan","You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"
"18","6","Randy","How?!
"
"18","6","Randy","I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
"
"18","6","Kyle","Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
"
"18","6","Randy","I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
"
"18","6","Stan","Yeah, it's fun.
"
"18","6","Randy","I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
"
"18","6","Stan","...Free? 
"
"18","6","Randy","$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
"
"18","6","Stan","No, no, it's not.
"
"18","6","Randy","I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
"
"18","6","Cartman","It's done. 
"
"18","6","Stan","Okay.
"
"18","6","Stan","The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
"18","6","Stan","I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
"18","6","Kyle","Y-you alright?
"
"18","6","Stan","Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
"18","6","Cartman","Cool.
"
"18","6","Stan","We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
"18","6","Randy","It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
"
"18","7","Butters","More of the school. 
"
"18","7","Cartman","Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
"18","7","Butters","What what what?
"
"18","7","Cartman","You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
"18","7","Butters","Yeah.
"
"18","7","Kyle","Coup de grah, Cartman
"
"18","7","Butters","Well, not a hundred percent...
"
"18","7","Cartman","Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
"18","7","Butters","It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
"
"18","7","Cartman","Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
"18","7","Cartman","Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
"
"18","7","Butters","Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
"18","7","Cartman","Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
"
"18","7","Butters","Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
"18","7","Cartman","Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
"18","7","Cartman","Fuck you!
"
"18","7","Butters","...What? What do you mean?
"
"18","7","Cartman","Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
"18","7","Butters","Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
"
"18","7","Cartman","That's right!
"
"18","7","Butters","Yeah.
"
"18","7","Kyle","Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
"18","7","Kyle","I don't care!
"
"18","7","Kyle","He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
"18","7","Stan","Oh fuck you!
"
"18","7","Kyle","Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
"18","7","Kyle","Www-what do you mean?
"
"18","7","Kyle","NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
"18","7","Cartman","Or if I did?
"
"18","7","Kyle","Dude... What?
"
"18","7","Stan","No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
"18","7","Kyle","Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
"18","7","Kyle","He's lying.
"
"18","7","Butters","Ahhh, huh?
"
"18","7","Butters","Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore."
"18","8","Kyle","Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
"18","8","Stan","Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
"18","8","Cartman","This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
"18","8","Stan","Shhh!
"
"18","8","Kyle","He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
"
"18","8","Stan","We're men.
"
"18","8","Kyle","It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
"18","8","Cartman","Dude, that was total carnage!
"
"18","8","Kyle","It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"
"18","8","Stan","Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
"18","8","Randy","Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
"
"18","8","Cartman","Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
"18","8","Kyle","We don't... really know the difference.
"
"18","8","Cartman","Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
"18","8","Cartman","""Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
"
"18","8","Kyle","You can do it, McNuggets! 
"
"18","8","Cartman","That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
"18","8","Kyle","You mean there's more to this?
"
"18","8","Mr. Garrison","All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
"
"18","8","Cartman","Ten darra?! 
"
"18","8","Randy","Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
"
"18","10","Kyle","Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
"18","10","Butters","Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
"
"18","10","Kyle","Really??
"
"18","10","Kyle","Bill Cosby.
"
"18","10","Kyle","These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
"18","10","Stan","That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
"18","10","Kyle","That son of a bitch!
"
"18","10","Stan","That self-promoting asshole!
"
"18","10","Randy","Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
"
"18","10","Randy","I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
"
"18","10","Cartman","Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
"
"18","10","Cartman","...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
"
"18","10","Kyle","I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"
"18","10","Randy","Oh my God...
"
"18","10","Cartman","Oh, this should be good.
"
"18","10","Stan","Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"
"18","10","Kyle","How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
"
"18","10","Cartman","Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
"
"18","10","Cartman","Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
"
"18","10","Cartman","I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
"
"18","10","Cartman","Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
"18","10","Cartman","NOOOO! 
"
"18","10","Kyle","Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
"
"18","10","Stan","Yeah.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
"1","1","Stan","What's a dildo?
"
"1","1","Cartman","He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 
"
"1","1","Kyle","Kick the baby. 
"
"1","1","Stan","Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
"1","1","Cartman","That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Totally!
"
"1","1","Cartman","Oh!
"
"1","1","Stan","Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
"
"1","1","Cartman","No!
"
"1","1","Cartman","God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
"
"1","1","Kyle","No, Ike, go home.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Ike! Go home!
"
"1","1","Kyle","Oh, my God! 
"
"1","1","Stan","Visitors!
"
"1","1","Stan","Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"
"1","1","Cartman","Shut up you guys, it's not working.
"
"1","1","Kyle","""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?""
"
"1","1","Stan","Dude!
"
"1","1","Stan","Chef!
"
"1","1","Stan","Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
"
"1","1","Stan","Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
"
"1","1","Cartman","I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
"
"1","1","Kyle","He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
"
"1","1","Cartman","You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
"
"1","1","Cartman","Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker!
"
"1","1","Kyle","You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
"
"1","1","Stan","Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Now do you believe us, Cartman?
"
"1","1","Kyle","He's dead, Cartman! 
"
"1","1","Kyle","You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
"
"1","1","Stan","Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
"
"1","1","Cartman","I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
"
"1","1","Cartman","No, Mom, leave me alone! 
"
"1","1","Cartman","Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
"
"1","1","Cartman","No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
"
"1","1","Cartman","What?
"
"1","1","Kyle","Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
"
"1","1","Stan","Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
"
"1","1","Cartman","Oh, man, this sucks.
"
"1","1","Cartman","Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
"
"1","1","Cartman","Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
"
"1","1","Stan","Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
"
"1","1","Cartman","Sure, you guys, what-ever. 
"
"1","1","Kyle","Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
"
"1","1","Stan","Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Yeh, we're running out of friends.
"
"1","1","Stan","I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
"
"1","1","Kyle","Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
"
"1","2","Kyle","What was your paper about Wendy?
"
"1","2","Cartman","There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.
"
"1","2","Cartman","Beefcake!
"
"1","2","Cartman","Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.  Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage .
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","Okay Bebe, this is your line.
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?
"
"1","2","Kyle","Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!""
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
"
"1","2","Cartman","This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
"
"1","2","Stan","Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
"
"1","2","Mr. Garrison","Really, on what?
"
"1","3","Cartman","Dude, that's sick mom.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Eeeh!  
"
"1","3","Stan","Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
"
"1","3","Kyle","What?!
"
"1","3","Stan","I can shoot you, fat ass!
"
"1","3","Cartman","I can shoot you too!
"
"1","3","Cartman","Heh, that's not scary.
"
"1","3","Kyle","No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
"
"1","3","Stan","Yeah, Cartman's pee.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Hey, you would taste my pee!
"
"1","3","Kyle","Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
"
"1","3","Kyle","Deformed how?
"
"1","3","Cartman","What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
"
"1","3","Kyle","What is that?
"
"1","3","Stan","Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Hey, it might be!
"
"1","3","Kyle","Look!
"
"1","3","Stan","Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
"
"1","3","Kyle","Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
"1","3","Stan","Hey, that was easy!
"
"1","3","Stan","No.
"
"1","3","Kyle","Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
"
"1","3","Stan","Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
"
"1","3","Cartman","Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
"
"1","4","Stan","He's not meaner than Sparky.
"
"1","4","Cartman","Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 
"
"1","4","Stan","Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
"
"1","4","Stan","Huh? 
"
"1","4","Kyle","Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
"
"1","4","Stan","Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
"
"1","4","Stan","Um, I'm not really prepared either.
"
"1","4","Stan","Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
"
"1","4","Stan","He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
"
"1","4","Kyle","Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
"
"1","4","Kyle","What'd he say?
"
"1","4","Stan","I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
"
"1","4","Cartman","Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
"
"1","4","Stan","My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
"
"1","4","Stan","Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
"
"1","4","Cartman","We'll just see about that.
"
"1","4","Kyle","Hut.
"
"1","4","Stan","Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
"
"1","4","Kyle","Hut, hut. 
"
"1","4","Kyle","Hike!
"
"1","4","Stan","And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
"
"1","5","Cartman","I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""
"
"1","5","Kyle","You mean this one?
"
"1","5","Stan","Yeah.
"
"1","5","Kyle","No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
"
"1","5","Cartman","If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""
"
"1","5","Kyle","I'll bet you can't.
"
"1","5","Cartman","Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
"
"1","5","Mr. Garrison","Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. 
"
"1","5","Stan","Headgear?  What headgear?
"
"1","5","Kyle","Ready to go Stan?
"
"1","5","Stan","Go where?
"
"1","5","Kyle","Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
"
"1","5","Kyle","What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
"
"1","5","Kyle","Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
"
"1","5","Kyle","Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
"
"1","5","Kyle","It's more than you've got!
"
"1","5","Stan","I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
"
"1","5","Cartman","I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
"
"1","5","Kyle","Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
"
"1","5","Cartman","No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
"
"1","5","Kyle","Dammit! This is never gonna work.
"
"1","5","Kyle","Hey look!  It's working.
"
"1","5","Kyle","Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
"
"1","5","Cartman","Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!
"
"1","5","Mr. Garrison","Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
"
"1","5","Stan","…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
"
"1","5","Kyle","Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
"
"1","5","Stan","Thanks a lot.
"
"1","5","Randy","Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
"
"1","5","Cartman","That'll do pig.
"
"1","6","Stan","Heheheh hehehe...
"
"1","6","Stan","I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"
"1","6","Cartman","That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
"
"1","6","Kyle","Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
"
"1","6","Mr. Garrison","I thought you just came from the bathroom.
"
"1","6","Cartman","What?
"
"1","6","Stan","My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
"
"1","6","Stan","So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
"
"1","6","Kyle","But won't your grampa be there?
"
"1","6","Stan","Yeah...
"
"1","6","Cartman","Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
"
"1","6","Cartman","Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
"
"1","6","Randy","Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
"
"1","6","Stan","No, I can't even kill a deer.
"
"1","6","Stan","Grampa!
"
"1","6","Stan","Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
"
"1","6","Cartman","Don't talk about my mom like that!
"
"1","6","Stan","Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
"
"1","6","Stan","What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
"1","6","Cartman","Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
"
"1","6","Kyle","Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
"1","6","Stan","Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
"
"1","6","Randy","Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
"
"1","6","Stan","You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
"
"1","6","Stan","What is that?!
"
"1","6","Kyle","What are we gonna do?
"
"1","6","Stan","Yeah, but, mom!
"
"1","6","Stan","Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
"
"1","6","Stan","Whoa!
"
"1","6","Stan","What are you doing grampa?
"
"1","7","Kyle","You bastards!
"
"1","7","Kyle","Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
"
"1","7","Stan","Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. 
"
"1","7","Kyle","What uh, what are you supposed to be?
"
"1","7","Stan","I'm Raggedy Andy.
"
"1","7","Kyle","Wow! Cool!
"
"1","7","Kyle","No it's not cool!
"
"1","7","Stan","Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
"
"1","7","Stan","Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
"
"1","7","Kyle","Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
"
"1","7","Stan","Whoa, dude!
"
"1","7","Mr. Garrison","It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
"
"1","7","Kyle","Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
"1","7","Kyle","I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
"
"1","7","Cartman","I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
"
"1","7","Kyle","I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
"
"1","7","Cartman","Who?
"
"1","7","Kyle","What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
"
"1","7","Stan","Plastic pumpkin pails...
"
"1","7","Cartman","Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
"
"1","7","Stan","How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
"
"1","7","Cartman","Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
"
"1","7","Kyle","Chef, you've gotta help us!
"
"1","7","Kyle","Yeah, I'm scared.
"
"1","7","Kyle","See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
"
"1","7","Cartman","It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
"
"1","7","Stan","You call the number Kyle.
"
"1","7","Stan","I know, but uh-... but...
"
"1","7","Cartman","Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
"
"1","7","Stan","Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
"
"1","7","Cartman","Kill her Stan!
"
"1","7","Kyle","Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
"
"1","7","Stan","Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
"
"1","7","Kyle","...No, dude, that's Christmas.
"
"1","7","Stan","Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
"
"1","8","Kyle","Yeah!
"
"1","8","Cartman","Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
"
"1","8","Cartman","Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
"
"1","8","Stan","Hey, who's that fat chick?
"
"1","8","Kyle","Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
"
"1","8","Cartman","Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
"
"1","8","Mr. Garrison","Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?
"
"1","8","Cartman","Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
"
"1","8","Mr. Garrison","I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
"
"1","8","Cartman","Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
"
"1","8","Cartman","What the hell?
"
"1","8","Kyle","Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
"
"1","8","Stan","Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
"
"1","8","Kyle","Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
"
"1","8","Cartman","No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
"
"1","8","Kyle","Totally. 
"
"1","8","Cartman","No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
"
"1","8","Mr. Garrison","All right boys, show us what you've brought. 
"
"1","8","Mr. Garrison","The sports watch from the commercial?
"
"1","8","Mr. Garrison","Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
"
"1","8","Kyle","Because why?
"
"1","8","Kyle","You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
"
"1","8","Cartman","Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
"
"1","8","Cartman","Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 
"
"1","8","Stan","Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 
"
"1","9","Mr. Garrison","Because it's Christmas???
"
"1","9","Kyle","Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
"
"1","9","Cartman","Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
"
"1","9","Kyle","It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
"
"1","9","Cartman","Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
"
"1","9","Kyle","Wait...
"
"1","9","Kyle","There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
"1","9","Kyle","I'm not hearing that.
"
"1","9","Kyle","I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
"
"1","9","Kyle","Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
"
"1","9","Kyle","Hello, everybodyyy.
"
"1","9","Stan","What's in the box, dude?
"
"1","9","Cartman","O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
"
"1","9","Cartman","Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.
"
"1","9","Mr. Garrison","...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay.  Now let's practice our... 
"
"1","9","Stan","Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
"
"1","9","Kyle","Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
"
"1","9","Stan","I believe. 
"
"1","9","Stan","Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
"1","9","Kyle","Friends? 
"
"1","10","Cartman","Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
"
"1","10","Cartman","Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
"
"1","10","Cartman","Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
"
"1","10","Stan","Jesus, Jesus!
"
"1","10","Stan","This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
"
"1","10","Stan","Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
"
"1","10","Kyle","Hey, you just got here, Chef!
"
"1","10","Cartman","Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
"
"1","10","Cartman","YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
"
"1","10","Stan","Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
"
"1","10","Cartman","Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
"
"1","10","Kyle","Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
"
"1","10","Kyle","Hmmm.
"
"1","10","Mr. Garrison","Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
"
"1","11","Stan","Yeu-bluuuch. 
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","Oh, that's not bad.
"
"1","11","Stan","No.
"
"1","11","Kyle","My laundry detergent?
"
"1","11","Stan","That's not Kyle's...
"
"1","11","Cartman","I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
"
"1","11","Stan","Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.
"
"1","11","Kyle","Where's your present, Cartman?
"
"1","11","Kyle","Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
"
"1","11","Stan","No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
"
"1","11","Cartman","Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
"
"1","11","Kyle","Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","Well?
"
"1","11","Kyle","And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
"
"1","11","Cartman","This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","Hello there, children! 
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","A few hundred?
"
"1","11","Mr. Garrison","What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! 
"
"1","11","Kyle","Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
"
"1","11","Kyle","Wendy! You didn't!
"
"1","12","Kyle","Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
"
"1","12","Stan","What is it?
"
"1","12","Kyle","You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
"
"1","12","Kyle","You threw it away, fatso!
"
"1","12","Cartman","Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
"
"1","12","Cartman","Screw you, triangle thief!
"
"1","12","Cartman","Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
"
"1","12","Kyle","I didn't steal anything.
"
"1","12","Stan","...so?
"
"1","12","Stan","Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
"
"1","12","Stan","Whoa, dude!
"
"1","12","Cartman","Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun
"
"1","12","Cartman","No, not when money is involved, stupid! 
"
"1","12","Cartman","I don't remember.
"
"1","12","Kyle","Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
"
"1","12","Cartman","Yes! She stole my triangle!
"
"1","12","Kyle","Whoa, that was cool!
"
"1","12","Mr. Garrison","We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat.
"
"1","12","Kyle","Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
"
"1","13","Stan","In the backyard?
"
"1","13","Cartman","Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
"
"1","13","Cartman","Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. 
"
"1","13","Kyle","Woo-whataya mean?
"
"1","13","Cartman","You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
"
"1","13","Cartman","I want to know where I came from.
"
"1","13","Cartman","Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.
"
"1","13","Stan","Aaawww.
"
"1","13","Kyle","Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
"
"1","13","Stan","Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
"
"1","13","Cartman","Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. 
"
"1","13","Stan","Go ahead, dude. 
"
"1","13","Kyle","Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
"
"1","13","Cartman","Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
"
"1","13","Kyle","If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
"
"1","13","Stan","Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
"
"1","13","Cartman","'S up, homies? 
"
"1","13","Cartman","Gee, that's kewl.

"1","13","Stan","Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
"
"1","13","Kyle","Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
"1","13","Kyle","Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
"
"1","13","Stan","Uuh, you'll see.
"
"1","13","Stan","Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
"
"2","2","Cartman","You've got to be kidding me!
"
"2","2","Kyle","What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
"2","2","Kyle","Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
"
"2","2","Kyle","I'm sailing away
"
"2","2","Stan","Oogh.
"
"2","2","Stan","I'm gotta get outta here!
"
"2","2","Cartman","Wake up, you son of a bitch!
"
"2","2","Kyle","Hey, Cartman.
"
"2","2","Stan","Oh, weak. 
"
"2","2","Cartman","...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
"
"2","2","Stan","Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
"2","2","Cartman","Go, Kenny!
"
"2","2","Kyle","You bastard! 
"
"2","2","Kyle","I don't know. Let's find out.
"
"2","3","Stan","If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
"2","3","Stan","No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
"2","3","Cartman","10-4, sergeant! 
"
"2","3","Stan","I.
"
"2","3","Cartman","I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
"
"2","3","Cartman","Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
"
"2","3","Kyle","It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
"2","3","Stan","I dunno.
"
"2","3","Kyle","Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
"2","3","Kyle","Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
"2","3","Cartman","Ooohhhh.
"
"2","3","Cartman","Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
"
"2","4","Kyle","We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
"
"2","4","Cartman","Okay?
"
"2","4","Kyle","I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
"2","4","Stan","Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
"2","4","Kyle","Why bad?
"
"2","4","Kyle","Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
"2","4","Stan","Ahhh, bicycles?
"
"2","4","Cartman","Ham?
"
"2","4","Kyle","Your heart?
"
"2","4","Stan","Your eyes? 
"
"2","4","Kyle","Stop who?
"
"2","4","Stan","Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
"2","4","Kyle","AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
"2","4","Kyle","I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
"2","4","Stan","What are you goin' to do, dude?
"
"2","4","Kyle","I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
"2","4","Stan","Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
"
"2","4","Stan","Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
"2","4","Cartman","Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
"
"2","4","Stan","Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
"2","4","Cartman","Fireman!
"
"2","4","Kyle","You bastards! 
"
"2","4","Mr. Garrison","Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
"
"2","5","Kyle","Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
"2","5","Kyle","Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
"2","5","Kyle","Oh-- Noooo!
"
"2","5","Stan","AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
"2","5","Cartman","AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
"
"2","5","Stan","No! I have to get it out!
"
"2","5","Stan","Aw, do we have to?
"
"2","5","Cartman","Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
"
"2","5","Kyle","Wow, that was easy.
"
"2","5","Cartman","So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
"
"2","5","Kyle","Yeah, you're from China.
"
"2","5","Kyle","Agghh!
"
"2","5","Stan","Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
"2","5","Cartman","Holy crap!
"
"2","5","Kyle","Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
"2","5","Stan","Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
"2","5","Cartman","I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
"
"2","6","Kyle","Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
"2","6","Mr. Garrison","Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
"
"2","6","Cartman","Totally.
"
"2","6","Kyle","Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
"
"2","6","Kyle","Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
"2","6","Stan","Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
"2","6","Cartman","I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! 
"
"2","6","Kyle","'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
"2","6","Kyle","Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
"2","6","Stan","We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
"2","6","Kyle","Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
"
"2","6","Stan","Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
"2","6","Cartman","Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
"
"2","6","Stan","Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
"2","6","Kyle","Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
"2","7","Cartman","Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
"
"2","7","Cartman","Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 
"
"2","7","Kyle","Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
"2","7","Stan","I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
"2","7","Kyle","We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
"2","7","Stan","Dude!
"
"2","7","Kyle","Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
"2","7","Kyle","Fart, damn you!
"
"2","7","Kyle","Don't do it, kid. 
"
"2","7","Stan","Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
"2","7","Stan","Hey, look!
"
"2","7","Mr. Garrison","Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. 
"
"2","7","Stan","But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
"2","7","Cartman","Oh, yeah.
"
"2","7","Stan","Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
"2","7","Kyle","Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
"2","7","Stan","What?
"
"2","7","Cartman","Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
"
"2","7","Stan","You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
"2","7","Kyle","What are we gonna do?
"
"2","7","Kyle","Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
"2","7","Cartman","Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
"
"2","7","Stan","Boy, do I!
"
"2","7","Kyle","Really?
"
"2","7","Stan","Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
"2","8","Cartman","Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
"
"2","8","Kyle","Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
"2","8","Kyle","Dusty the dirtball
"
"2","8","Stan","Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","Hello, children. How is your summer going?
"
"2","8","Stan","That's good. 
"
"2","8","Stan","Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
"2","8","Cartman","It is not!
"
"2","8","Stan","He's taking swimming lessons.
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","Hello?
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","Goddammit..! 
"
"2","8","Kyle","I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","Are you propositioning me?
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
"
"2","8","Mr. Garrison","I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
"
"2","9","Cartman","I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
"
"2","9","Stan","Calm down, tubby.
"
"2","9","Stan","They what?!
"
"2","9","Cartman","Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
"
"2","9","Cartman","Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
"
"2","9","Stan","Hey, dude, these are good!
"
"2","9","Cartman","Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 
"
"2","9","Kyle","Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
"2","9","Cartman","No. 
"
"2","9","Kyle","Aaahh!
"
"2","9","Cartman","Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
"
"2","9","Kyle","They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
"2","9","Kyle","Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
"2","9","Cartman","Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
"
"2","9","Kyle","You guys, we have to hurry!
"
"2","9","Stan","Why?
"
"2","9","Kyle","I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
"
"2","9","Kyle","Nooohohohohohoho-
"
"2","9","Kyle","Yes?
"
"2","9","Kyle","Noo! No!
"
"2","9","Stan","Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
"2","9","Kyle","He's back! He's back! 
"
"2","9","Cartman","Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
"
"2","9","Kyle","Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
"
"2","9","Stan","What the hell is he doing?
"
"2","9","Stan","Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
"2","10","Kyle","Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
"2","10","Stan","Catch what?
"
"2","10","Cartman","Pfff..!
"
"2","10","Stan","Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
"2","10","Cartman","I don't wanna.
"
"2","10","Kyle","Yes. Why?
"
"2","10","Kyle","Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
"2","10","Kyle","Gods and clods?
"
"2","10","Stan","I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
"2","10","Stan","Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
"2","10","Stan","Weak!
"
"2","10","Kyle","Oh my God!
"
"2","10","Kyle","You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
"2","10","Cartman","""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool.""  Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."" 
"
"2","10","Kyle","Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
"2","10","Randy","Wh-where's Stan?
"
"2","10","Randy","Stan?
"
"2","10","Kyle","Are you old Frida?
"
"2","10","Stan","My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
"2","10","Kyle","D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
"2","10","Stan","Pretty good.
"
"2","11","Stan","Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
"2","11","Cartman","I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
"
"2","11","Cartman","How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?
"
"2","11","Cartman","Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
"
"2","11","Kyle","Did what?
"
"2","11","Kyle","Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
"
"2","11","Stan","Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","Was he on the school bus this morning?
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","Very good, Kyle.
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
"
"2","11","Mr. Garrison","I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
"
"2","11","Kyle","What do you mean?
"
"2","11","Stan","Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
"
"2","11","Cartman","Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
"
"2","11","Stan","Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
"2","11","Cartman","I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch! 
"
"2","11","Cartman","I love Cheesy Poofs-
"
"2","11","Cartman","I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
"
"2","11","Kyle","Cartman! You saved us! 
"
"2","11","Stan","Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
"2","12","Stan","No, you don't!
"
"2","12","Cartman","--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
"
"2","12","Kyle","Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
"2","12","Stan","Huh-I dunno.
"
"2","12","Stan","But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
"
"2","12","Stan","Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
"2","12","Stan","Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
"
"2","12","Randy","Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
"
"2","12","Randy","Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
"
"2","12","Randy","Whatever.
"
"2","12","Randy","Hey, back off, cunt!
"
"2","12","Stan","This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
"2","12","Kyle","What? Why?
"
"2","12","Stan","Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
"2","12","Kyle","It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
"2","12","Stan","Fine!
"
"2","12","Cartman","Fine!
"
"2","12","Stan","Fine!
"
"2","12","Cartman","Fine!
"
"2","12","Stan","Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
"2","12","Kyle","When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
"2","12","Mr. Garrison","I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
"
"2","12","Mr. Garrison","Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
"
"2","12","Kyle","Good guess, dude!
"
"2","12","Stan","Phew.
"
"2","12","Stan","No, I just--
"
"2","12","Stan","Shut up, Cartman!
"
"2","12","Stan","Who?
"
"2","12","Stan","Excuse me.
"
"2","12","Randy","Oh, please!
"
"2","12","Cartman","And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
"
"2","12","Stan","What?!
"
"2","12","Kyle","Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
"
"2","12","Stan","No way, dude! Don't be silly.
"
"2","12","Kyle","Too eager to what?
"
"2","12","Stan","To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.
"
"2","12","Stan","Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
"2","12","Stan","Dare.
"
"2","12","Kyle","Okay, that's fine.
"
"2","12","Stan","Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
"2","12","Stan","Divorce is stupid. 
"
"2","12","Cartman","This is bullcrap! 
"
"2","12","Randy","I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
"
"2","12","Randy","No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
"
"2","13","Kyle","You suck, Cartman!
"
"2","13","Kyle","Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
"2","13","Kyle","I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
"2","13","Cartman","How much is it?
"
"2","13","Cartman","Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
"
"2","13","Kyle","Okay.
"
"2","13","Cartman","Eh! God-damnit! 
"
"2","13","Kyle","This ride better be good!
"
"2","13","Stan","Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
"2","13","Cartman","I think we're almost to the end.
"
"2","13","Stan","What ride?
"
"2","13","Cartman","What? This is cool.
"
"2","13","Kyle","You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
"2","13","Stan","Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"
"2","13","Kyle","I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
"2","13","Cartman","Sweet.
"
"2","13","Kyle","What?!
"
"2","13","Kyle","Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
"2","13","Kyle","You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
"2","13","Kyle","I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"
"2","13","Cartman","All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
"
"2","13","Kyle","Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
"
"2","13","Stan","Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
"2","13","Cartman","Eeyy!
"
"2","13","Kyle","Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
"
"2","13","Stan","Come on, Cartman. 
"
"2","13","Stan","What's the matter with him.
"
"2","13","Kyle","We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
"
"2","13","Stan","Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
"2","13","Kyle","Go help him, Kenny!
"
"2","13","Kyle","What are we gonna do with them?
"
"2","13","Stan","We should- 
"
"2","13","Kyle","Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
"2","13","Kyle","Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
"2","14","Kyle","What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
"2","14","Cartman","Stinky britches, you got stinky--
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
"
"2","14","Cartman","You got stinky britches, stinky--
"
"2","14","Kyle","Wow, then you should get money for it!
"
"2","14","Cartman","Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! 
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
"
"2","14","Kyle","I don't know.
"
"2","14","Stan","That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"
"2","14","Cartman","Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!""
"
"2","14","Kyle","What's going on?
"
"2","14","Cartman","See? I told you guys it would work.
"
"2","14","Stan","Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
"2","14","Kyle","Yeah, b-but how?
"
"2","14","Stan","Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
"2","14","Cartman","What?!
"
"2","14","Stan","So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.
"
"2","14","Kyle","Cartman?
"
"2","14","Stan","No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
"2","14","Cartman","Four.
"
"2","14","Cartman","Yeah!
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
"
"2","14","Cartman","I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay

"
"2","14","Kyle","Well, we helped.
"
"2","14","Stan","We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
"2","14","Stan","Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
"
"2","14","Mr. Garrison","Yes.
"
"2","15","Kyle","Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
"
"2","15","Stan","Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
"2","15","Kyle","What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
"2","15","Stan","Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
"2","15","Cartman","Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 
"
"2","15","Stan","Damn it! 
"
"2","15","Kyle","You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
"2","15","Randy","Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
"
"2","15","Stan","I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
"2","15","Stan","WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
"2","15","Stan","But MOM!
"
"2","15","Kyle","Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
"2","15","Stan","I haven't been sleeping so well.
"
"2","15","Cartman","God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 
"
"2","15","Cartman","No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys?

"
"2","15","Cartman","Why the hell not?!
"
"2","15","Cartman","Dude, this is hella weird.
"
"2","15","Kyle","Chef.
"
"2","15","Kyle","We have problems!
"
"2","15","Kyle","Will you stop saying that word?!
"
"2","15","Stan","Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
"2","15","Stan","It was the fish! 
"
"2","15","Kyle","Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
"2","15","Cartman","Screw you! 
"
"2","15","Cartman","Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
"
"2","15","Stan","I know.
"
"2","15","Stan","Yeah, dude.
"
"2","15","Randy","There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
"
"2","15","Randy","Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
"
"2","15","Stan","I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
"2","15","Cartman","P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
"
"2","15","Cartman","Don't touch me! 
"
"2","15","Stan","Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
"
"2","15","Cartman","Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
"
"2","15","Kyle","Leave him alone, butthole!
"
"2","15","Kyle","Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
"
"2","15","Stan","Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"
"2","15","Cartman","Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
"
"2","15","Kyle","Damn it!
"
"2","16","Randy","Eh, it's fine with me.
"
"2","16","Kyle","Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
"2","16","Cartman","How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
"
"2","16","Cartman","Hi, Grandpa!
"
"2","16","Cartman","Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
"
"2","16","Stan","Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
"2","16","Cartman","Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
"
"2","16","Stan","We thought you were in jail.
"
"2","16","Kyle","We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
"
"2","16","Cartman","Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
"
"2","16","Cartman","Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
"
"2","16","Randy","Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
"
"2","16","Cartman","And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
"
"2","16","Kyle","You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
"2","16","Stan","Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
"2","16","Stan","Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
"2","17","Stan","No.
"
"2","17","Stan","'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"
"2","17","Stan","Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
"2","17","Kyle","Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
"2","17","Stan","Whoopee!
"
"2","17","Kyle","Killer!! 
"
"2","17","Stan","Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
"2","17","Kyle","Sure. 
"
"2","17","Kyle","Thanks, dude.
"
"2","17","Kyle","""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
"2","17","Kyle","Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
"2","17","Mr. Garrison","That was close, Mr. Hat.
"
"2","17","Mr. Garrison","Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
"
"2","17","Kyle","Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
"2","17","Stan","Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
"2","17","Kyle","Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
"
"2","17","Cartman","I think my mom is a corporation.
"
"2","17","Kyle","Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"
"2","17","Cartman","Oh, your pussy village?
"
"2","17","Kyle","Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"
"2","17","Stan","No you don't, fatass!
"
"2","17","Stan","Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
"2","17","Kyle","Big corporations are good!
"
"2","17","Mr. Garrison","You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! 
"
"2","17","Cartman","I love you guys. 
"
"2","18","Cartman","Come 'ere, crocky.
"
"2","18","Cartman","Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. 
"
"2","18","Cartman","I'm right here, Kyle.
"
"2","18","Kyle","I don't think so.
"
"2","18","Stan","Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
"2","18","Cartman","Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
"
"2","18","Stan","Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
"2","18","Cartman","Aww, screw you guys anyway!
"
"2","18","Stan","Where shall we bring it?
"
"2","18","Kyle","It's my name, and I found him.
"
"2","18","Stan","You didn't find him, I found him.
"
"2","18","Kyle","No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
"2","18","Kyle","Why are you being such a dick?
"
"2","18","Stan","I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
"
"2","18","Stan","Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
"2","18","Kyle","Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
"
"2","18","Stan","Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
"2","18","Kyle","Fine! 
"
"2","18","Stan","Fine! 
"
"2","18","Cartman","Fine.
"
"2","18","Stan","He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
"2","18","Stan","I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
"2","18","Kyle","You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
"2","18","Stan","Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
"
"2","18","Kyle","Steve, wait!
"
"2","18","Stan","What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
"2","18","Kyle","It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
"2","18","Stan","We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
"2","18","Kyle","Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
"2","18","Kyle","Uhuh.
"
"2","18","Cartman","They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
"
"2","18","Kyle","Hey!
"
"2","18","Stan","He's alive!
"
"2","18","Kyle","Me, too. He sucks.
"
"3","1","Cartman","Okay.
"
"3","1","Mr. Garrison","Go ahead.
"
"3","1","Cartman","Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
"3","1","Kyle","No! That's a stereotype.
"
"3","1","Stan","Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
"
"3","1","Kyle","No, dude. That's a branch.
"
"3","1","Stan","Oh.  Aaah! Snake!
"
"3","1","Cartman","Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
"3","1","Cartman","Respect my authoritah!
"
"3","1","Kyle","What's the Yanogapa?
"
"3","1","Cartman","Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
"
"3","1","Stan","AAAAAAA! 
"
"3","1","Kyle","Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
"3","1","Stan","This doesn't look very safe.
"
"3","1","Cartman","Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
"
"3","1","Stan","Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
"
"3","1","Cartman","Food! I have to have food! 
"
"3","1","Kyle","Yeah! Fragile my ass!
"
"3","1","Stan","You know, ""they.""
"
"3","2","Kyle","Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
"3","2","Stan","That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
"
"3","2","Cartman","Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
"3","2","Stan","He just... ignited.
"
"3","2","Kyle","Well, I'm Jewish.
"
"3","2","Kyle","Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
"
"3","2","Cartman","Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
"
"3","2","Cartman","Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
"3","2","Randy","Damn it! How come you're not combusting? 
"
"3","2","Stan","Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
"
"3","2","Cartman","This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
"
"3","2","Randy","Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
"
"3","2","Stan","Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks.""
"
"3","2","Cartman","Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
"3","2","Cartman","Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
"
"3","2","Kyle","Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
"3","2","Stan","Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
"
"3","2","Cartman","Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
"3","2","Kyle","Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
"
"3","2","Stan","Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
"
"3","2","Kyle","Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
"3","2","Cartman","Officer Barbrady! 
"
"3","2","Kyle","Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
"3","2","Stan","Dude, he's still not dead.
"
"3","2","Cartman","You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
"3","2","Cartman","You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
"
"3","2","Cartman","Chef! Chef!
"
"3","2","Cartman","What?
"
"3","2","Stan","Dad, where's the phone book?
"
"3","2","Stan","Oh.
"
"3","2","Stan","Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
"
"3","2","Kyle","Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
"3","2","Randy","Uh. Please, everyone- 
"
"3","2","Randy","I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
"
"3","3","Cartman","But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
"
"3","3","Cartman","Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
"3","3","Cartman","God damn it!
"
"3","3","Cartman","Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
"3","3","Cartman","Uh, one.
"
"3","3","Stan","Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? 
"
"3","3","Cartman","My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
"3","3","Cartman","Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
"3","3","Stan","Where's Chef?
"
"3","3","Stan","Why did Chef quit?
"
"3","3","Kyle","Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
"3","3","Stan","Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
"
"3","3","Cartman","I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
"
"3","3","Cartman","Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
"3","3","Kyle","Dude! Just take them off!
"
"3","3","Kyle","I can't believe it!
"
"3","3","Stan","Come on! We're going to his house! 
"
"3","3","Mr. Garrison","And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
"
"3","3","Mr. Garrison","Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
"
"3","3","Kyle","That's it!
"
"3","3","Stan","Yeah!
"
"3","3","Kyle","Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
"3","3","Mr. Garrison","Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
"
"3","3","Stan","Who are you?
"
"3","3","Stan","Yeah?
"
"3","3","Kyle","Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
"
"3","3","Cartman","Oh no! The tape jammed! 
"
"3","3","Kyle","You bastard!
"
"3","3","Stan","We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
"
"3","3","Mr. Garrison","Poontang's poontang.
"
"3","3","Cartman","Eh-sure.
"
"3","4","Cartman","You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
"3","4","Stan","How much?
"
"3","4","Cartman","Five bucks.
"
"3","4","Stan","Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
"
"3","4","Cartman","Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
"3","4","Kyle","Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
"3","4","Stan","Yeah, it was weak.
"
"3","4","Cartman","Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
"
"3","4","Kyle","Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
"3","4","Stan","All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
"
"3","4","Cartman","I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
"3","4","Cartman","Fine, that's fine!
"
"3","4","Cartman","Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
"
"3","4","Cartman","Come on, Craig!
"
"3","4","Kyle","Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
"3","4","Stan","Here they are.
"
"3","4","Kyle","Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
"3","5","Cartman","You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.
"
"3","5","Kyle","Just go behind a tree.
"
"3","5","Kyle","You just squat, stupid! 
"
"3","5","Stan","Not here! Go further away!
"
"3","5","Cartman","God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
"
"3","5","Stan","Sick, dude!
"
"3","5","Cartman","Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
"
"3","5","Stan","We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
"
"3","5","Cartman","You guys, get over here!
"
"3","5","Stan","I see it!
"
"3","5","Cartman","Come on! Let's kill it! 
"
"3","5","Mr. Garrison","Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!
"
"3","5","Cartman","But the other jakovasaur talked different.
"
"3","5","Cartman","Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!
"
"3","5","Stan","Why don't we just tell our parents?
"
"3","5","Cartman","No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
"
"3","5","Cartman","Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
"
"3","5","Cartman","Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
"
"3","5","Cartman","Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 
"
"3","5","Cartman","What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
"
"3","5","Kyle","There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
"3","6","Stan","I called you an ass-sucker!
"
"3","6","Cartman","Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 
"
"3","6","Stan","Uh, no! I hate that toy!
"
"3","6","Cartman","Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
"
"3","6","Cartman","What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
"
"3","6","Mr. Garrison","Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
"
"3","6","Mr. Garrison","Uh, Craig, how about you?
"
"3","6","Cartman","Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
"
"3","6","Kyle","Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
"3","6","Kyle","Isn't that fascism?
"
"3","6","Cartman","Where's that?
"
"3","6","Stan","Have you seen any panda bears?
"
"3","6","Kyle","No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
"3","6","Kyle","That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
"3","6","Stan","No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
"
"3","7","Cartman","What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
"
"3","7","Cartman","Right.
"
"3","7","Cartman","Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!
"
"3","7","Cartman","This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!
"
"3","7","Cartman","Ey! I need to use the phone!
"
"3","7","Cartman","What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
"3","7","Cartman","You just want me to open the door!
"
"3","7","Cartman","Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
"
"3","7","Cartman","Aw, man, you guys suck.
"
"3","7","Cartman","Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
"
"3","7","Cartman","That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
"3","7","Cartman","You're not ugly.
"
"3","7","Cartman","If you want, I could help you.
"
"3","7","Cartman","Oh my God! 
"
"3","8","Stan","I don't want to go to this stupid party!
"
"3","8","Randy","Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
"
"3","8","Stan","Shut up, Pip.
"
"3","8","Randy","I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
"
"3","8","Stan","What do I have to do?
"
"3","8","Butters","Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
"
"3","8","Stan","What, Pip?
"
"3","8","Randy","With two girls or two guys?
"
"3","8","Randy","Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
"
"3","8","Stan","Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
"
"3","8","Randy","Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
"
"3","8","Randy","Okay. 
"
"3","8","Butters","Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
"
"3","8","Stan","Whoa, cool!
"
"3","8","Stan","Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
"
"3","8","Butters","Whoa!
"
"3","8","Stan","Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
"3","8","Stan","We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
"
"3","8","Stan","You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
"
"3","8","Randy","Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
"
"3","8","Stan","Can you hit a target, Pip?
"
"3","8","Stan","Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. 
"
"3","8","Butters","Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
"
"3","9","Kyle","Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
"3","9","Kyle","Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
"3","9","Kyle","No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
"3","9","Kyle","He was huge.
"
"3","9","Kyle","What is that?
"
"3","10","Cartman","No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
"
"3","10","Cartman","Hooray! 
"
"3","10","Cartman","Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
"
"3","10","Kyle","No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
"3","10","Kyle","Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
"3","10","Kyle","Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
"3","10","Stan","Ogh..!
"
"3","10","Cartman","Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
"
"3","10","Cartman","Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
"
"3","10","Randy","Why?
"
"3","10","Stan","What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
"
"3","10","Cartman","Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
"
"3","10","Cartman","The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
"
"3","10","Kyle","Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
"3","10","Kyle","...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
"3","10","Mr. Garrison","For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
"
"3","10","Randy","Well, I guess that settles that.
"
"3","10","Stan","Nan da kore? 
"
"3","10","Randy","Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
"
"3","10","Cartman","Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
"
"3","10","Kyle","But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
"3","10","Stan","Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
"
"3","10","Kyle","So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
"3","10","Stan","...Ye-eah.
"
"3","11","Cartman","Oh, dude, this is not cool!
"
"3","11","Cartman","Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! 
"
"3","11","Cartman","Totally!
"
"3","11","Cartman","Oh. We don't know him.
"
"3","11","Cartman","No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
"
"3","11","Kyle","Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
"
"3","11","Cartman","Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
"
"3","11","Kyle","I think he wants us to get in.
"
"3","11","Stan","Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!
"
"3","11","Stan","This is great!
"
"3","11","Cartman","Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
"
"3","11","Stan","What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! 
"
"3","11","Stan","U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
"
"3","11","Stan","Uuh. Thanks.
"
"3","11","Stan","What??
"
"3","11","Cartman","Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
"
"3","11","Stan","He's not done for, he's standing right there.
"
"3","11","Stan","They're shooting at us.
"
"3","11","Kyle","Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
"3","11","Kyle","Where did that come from??
"
"3","11","Cartman","Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
"
"3","11","Cartman","Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
"
"3","11","Stan","Now's our chance!
"
"3","11","Cartman","Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
"
"3","11","Kyle","Marvin... 
"
"3","11","Kyle","Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
"3","11","Cartman","Alright,
"
"3","12","Stan","Christmas?
"
"3","12","Cartman","—Christmastime is presents for me.
"
"3","12","Kyle","Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
"3","12","Cartman","You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
"
"3","12","Kyle","That's not scary, fatass!
"
"3","12","Stan","Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
"
"3","12","Cartman","God-damnit, mom!
"
"3","12","Kyle","Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
"
"3","12","Cartman","""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!""  Ow.
"
"3","12","Stan","Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
"
"3","12","Kyle","Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
"3","12","Stan","Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
"
"3","12","Cartman","Heh heh, I'm sweet.
"
"3","12","Cartman","We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!""
"
"3","12","Kyle","Cartman?!
"
"3","12","Stan","Hay, you're that band KoRn.
"
"3","12","Kyle","Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
"3","12","Stan","Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
"
"3","12","Stan","Hey, Kenny.
"
"3","12","Kyle","Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
"3","12","Kyle","God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
"3","12","Kyle","Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
"3","12","Stan","How should we split up?
"
"3","12","Stan","There she is!
"
"3","13","Cartman","T, H. ""Th."" There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!
"
"3","13","Kyle","Definition?
"
"3","13","Kyle","""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!
"
"3","13","Stan","Shut up, Cartman?
"
"3","13","Cartman","You shut up,  butthole.
"
"3","13","Mr. Garrison","Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
"
"3","13","Cartman","That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
"
"3","13","Butters","Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
"
"3","13","Butters","Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
"
"3","13","Kyle","Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
"
"3","13","Stan","Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
"
"3","13","Kyle","What??
"
"3","13","Kyle","Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
"3","13","Stan","Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
"
"3","13","Cartman","Eeehhh.
"
"3","13","Cartman","Mom?
"
"3","13","Kyle","Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
"3","13","Cartman","No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
"
"3","13","Butters","Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 
"
"3","13","Kyle","Aaaah!
"
"3","13","Butters","Yeah. He's a badass! 
"
"3","14","Kyle","You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
"3","14","Stan","Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
"
"3","14","Cartman","Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
"3","14","Stan","Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
"
"3","14","Cartman","Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
"3","14","Kyle","The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
"3","14","Kyle","Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
"3","14","Stan","Cartman, you can't do that!
"
"3","14","Cartman","Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
"3","14","Mr. Garrison","You Yankee sons of bitches!
"
"3","14","Randy","Ow! That hurt!
"
"3","14","Kyle","What do we do?!
"
"3","14","Stan","Run for your life, dude! 
"
"3","14","Cartman","God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
"3","14","Randy","Oh?
"
"3","14","Cartman","I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
"
"3","14","Cartman","Perhaps we should take Topeka.
"
"3","14","Cartman","I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
"3","14","Cartman","Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
"3","14","Kyle","Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"
"3","14","Stan","That would suck so much ass.
"
"3","14","Kyle","Hey!
"
"3","14","Stan","Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
"
"3","14","Mr. Garrison","Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
"
"3","14","Cartman","We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
"3","14","Randy","Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
"
"3","14","Cartman","Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
"3","14","Kyle","We'll never stop them now.
"
"3","14","Cartman","Yes! Yes!
"
"3","14","Randy","What was that?? 
"
"3","14","Stan","Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
"
"3","14","Cartman","I don't. I made it up. 
"
"3","14","Cartman","Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews...
"
"3","15","Stan","Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
"
"3","15","Kyle","Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
"3","15","Stan","I'll try
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews..
"
"3","15","Kyle","Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
"3","15","Stan","It fell;
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews...
"
"3","15","Kyle","Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
"3","15","Stan","I'll try
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews...
"
"3","15","Kyle","Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
"3","15","Stan","It fell;
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews...
"
"3","15","Kyle","Oh, hi Dad.
"
"3","15","Kyle","with dreidel I shall play.
"
"3","15","Stan","I'll try again.
"
"3","15","Cartman","...play stupid games.
"
"3","15","Kyle","Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
"3","15","Stan","It fell;
"
"3","15","Cartman","Jews...
"
"3","16","Kyle","You got your what?
"
"3","16","Kyle","Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
"3","16","Kyle","Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
"3","16","Stan","Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
"
"3","16","Kyle","Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
"3","16","Kyle","Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
"3","16","Cartman","Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
"3","16","Cartman","All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
"
"3","16","Stan","No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
"
"3","16","Mr. Garrison","He's coming out!
"
"3","16","Cartman","...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
"3","16","Stan","But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
"
"3","16","Stan","So do you know anything that can help him?
"
"3","16","Kyle","Hormones?
"
"3","16","Stan","Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
"
"3","16","Mr. Garrison","This sucks balls!
"
"3","17","Mr. Garrison","Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my  ...father still lives there.
"
"3","17","Mr. Garrison","Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
"
"3","17","Cartman","Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
"3","17","Cartman","We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
"3","17","Cartman","How about this one, Kenny? 
"
"3","17","Stan","Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
"
"3","17","Kyle","Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
"3","17","Cartman","Stan, what's a queef?
"
"3","17","Cartman","Aaaa-
"
"3","17","Stan","You did? 
"
"3","17","Stan","Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
"
"3","17","Kyle","Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
"
"3","17","Kyle","Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
"3","17","Kyle","What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
"3","17","Stan","I have no idea.
"
"3","17","Mr. Garrison","Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
"
"3","17","Kyle","I don't believe it!
"
"3","17","Stan","No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
"
"3","17","Cartman","Ooooh.
"
"3","17","Stan","Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
"
"3","17","Cartman","Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
"
"3","17","Mr. Garrison","Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
"
"3","17","Mr. Garrison","I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
"
"3","17","Kyle","Oh, no!
"
"4","1","Butters","Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
"
"4","1","Cartman","Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
"
"4","1","Cartman","What? A federal offense?
"
"4","1","Cartman","He is black.
"
"4","1","Cartman","I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
"4","1","Kyle","Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
"
"4","1","Kyle","Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
"
"4","1","Stan","Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
"
"4","1","Stan","Yeah-
"
"4","1","Kyle","We killed Kenny?
"
"4","1","Stan","We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
"
"4","1","Cartman","Hey you guys.
"
"4","1","Kyle","Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
"
"4","1","Stan","That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
"
"4","1","Kyle","Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
"
"4","1","Stan","Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
"
"4","1","Stan","It's not?
"
"4","1","Stan","Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
"
"4","1","Stan","Okay, go ahead and start.
"
"4","1","Cartman","What's the matter?
"
"4","1","Cartman","Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
"4","1","Cartman","Romper?
"
"4","1","Cartman","O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
"4","1","Cartman","That's right! I'm back! 
"
"4","1","Cartman","I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
"4","1","Cartman","Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
"4","2","Stan","What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
"
"4","2","Cartman","All we need is teeth.
"
"4","2","Kyle","You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
"
"4","2","Cartman","Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
"4","2","Kyle","Almost. You ready, Timmy?
"
"4","2","Butters","Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
"
"4","2","Butters","Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
"
"4","2","Cartman","Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
"4","2","Cartman","I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
"4","2","Butters","Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
"
"4","2","Cartman","Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
"
"4","2","Cartman","You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
"4","2","Kyle","Four dollars?
"
"4","2","Cartman","Do you what this means?
"
"4","2","Kyle","No more money??
"
"4","2","Stan","What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
"
"4","2","Cartman","I know!
"
"4","2","Cartman","My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
"
"4","2","Kyle","You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
"
"4","2","Kyle","Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"
"4","2","Kyle","Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
"
"4","2","Kyle","What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
"
"4","2","Kyle","Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
"
"4","2","Stan","We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"
"4","2","Cartman","Yeah. 
"
"4","2","Stan","Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""
"
"4","2","Cartman","Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
"4","2","Stan","Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
"
"4","2","Stan","You scram! We were here first!
"
"4","2","Stan","Oh. Uh-I don't know.
"
"4","2","Stan","We all want double-desserts today!
"
"4","2","Stan","Chef!
"
"4","2","Stan","No!
"
"4","2","Cartman","How much?
"
"4","2","Cartman","These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
"
"4","2","Kyle","Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
"
"4","2","Stan","Kyle?
"
"4","2","Stan","Really?
"
"4","3","Cartman","Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
"4","3","Kyle","Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
"
"4","3","Stan","Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
"
"4","3","Stan","Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
"
"4","3","Cartman","But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
"
"4","3","Randy","What? 
"
"4","3","Randy","That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
"
"4","3","Randy","I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
"
"4","3","Cartman","Dude, what the hell happened?
"
"4","3","Stan","We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
"
"4","3","Stan","Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"
"4","3","Kyle","Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
"
"4","3","Stan","Whatever happened to Kenny?
"
"4","4","Cartman","Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
"
"4","4","Mr. Garrison","—You need to work on your study skills!
"
"4","4","Mr. Garrison","That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
"
"4","4","Kyle","Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
"
"4","4","Cartman","That was awesuhome!
"
"4","4","Kyle","Yes, let's. 
"
"4","4","Kyle","You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
"4","4","Stan","Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
"4","4","Cartman","I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
"4","4","Cartman","Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah! 
"
"4","4","Cartman","Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
"
"4","4","Stan","Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
"
"4","6","Kyle","What?
"
"4","6","Cartman","God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
"4","6","Cartman","Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
"4","6","Kyle","See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
"
"4","6","Stan","Oh, man, that's terrible.
"
"4","6","Stan","We're making faces at sick people.
"
"4","6","Cartman","No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
"4","6","Stan","You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
"
"4","6","Cartman","YES I AM!! 
"
"4","6","Mr. Garrison","I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
"
"4","6","Cartman","You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
"4","6","Cartman","Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
"4","6","Cartman","...Sweet.
"
"4","6","Kyle","What are you talking about, fatass?
"
"4","6","Cartman","We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
"
"4","6","Cartman","No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
"
"4","6","Cartman","Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
"4","6","Butters","Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
"
"4","6","Cartman","Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
"4","6","Butters","Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
"
"4","7","Stan","...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
"
"4","7","Cartman","Huh?
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","Oh, whatever!
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... 
"
"4","7","Stan","Butters, go on!
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","I've always wanted to write a novel.
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","...Poontang.
"
"4","7","Stan","Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
"
"4","7","Cartman","No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
"4","7","Cartman","What's goin' on, guys?
"
"4","7","Stan","What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"
"4","7","Cartman","Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
"4","7","Stan","But you only need one, fat boy!
"
"4","7","Cartman","No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
"4","7","Cartman","I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
"
"4","7","Stan","And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"
"4","7","Stan","I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused.  ""Go on"", Rebecca said softly, ""Touch me."" Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!  Oh, Mr. Hat!
"
"4","7","Butters","Huh, where are we goin'?
"
"4","7","Cartman","No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
"
"4","7","Stan","If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
"
"4","7","Butters","Oh well, we're busted. 
"
"4","7","Stan","Oh, phew.
"
"4","7","Cartman","Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
"4","7","Stan","You suck, Cartman!
"
"4","7","Cartman","Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
"
"4","7","Stan","So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
"
"4","7","Cartman","No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
"4","7","Kyle","Better, thanks.
"
"4","7","Stan","You look a lot better.
"
"4","7","Stan","Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
"
"4","7","Cartman","Huh?
"
"4","7","Mr. Garrison","Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. 
"
"4","7","Cartman","Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
"4","8","Stan","You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"
"4","8","Cartman","Yes I do!
"
"4","8","Kyle","Yeah, me neither.
"
"4","8","Stan","But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
"
"4","8","Cartman","That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
"4","8","Cartman","You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
"
"4","8","Mr. Garrison","NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is. 
"
"4","8","Kyle","Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
"
"4","8","Stan","Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
"
"4","8","Kyle","Pretty good, I guess.
"
"4","8","Stan","Do you think they should change the flag?
"
"4","8","Mr. Garrison","Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
"
"4","8","Kyle","Huh?
"
"4","8","Kyle","W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
"4","8","Kyle","Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
"
"4","9","Cartman","Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
"
"4","9","Cartman","There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
"4","9","Cartman","So?
"
"4","9","Cartman","Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
"
"4","9","Butters","Ahah-oo well, alright then. 
"
"4","9","Kyle","I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
"
"4","9","Cartman","Goddammit, NEXT!
"
"4","9","Kyle","Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
"
"4","9","Kyle","I wanna be the tough one!
"
"4","9","Cartman","Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
"4","9","Cartman","But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
"4","9","Cartman","We... are Fingerbang!
"
"4","9","Cartman","Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
"4","9","Cartman","Well, so can we play here?
"
"4","9","Cartman","You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
"4","9","Kyle","Wow. I feel so rejected.
"
"4","9","Stan","Yeah.
"
"4","9","Cartman","I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
"
"4","9","Cartman","...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
"4","9","Stan","We are making a music video.
"
"4","9","Randy","Get in the truck! 
"
"4","9","Stan","Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
"
"4","9","Randy","Well, maybe it's time.
"
"4","9","Cartman","I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
"4","9","Cartman","Son of a bitch!
"
"4","9","Cartman","That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
"4","9","Cartman","Aw, Mom!
"
"4","9","Randy","See ya. 
"
"4","9","Randy","Who are they? 
"
"4","9","Randy","They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
"
"4","9","Randy","I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
"
"4","9","Kyle","Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
"
"4","9","Stan","Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
"
"4","9","Randy","You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
"
"4","9","Stan","Really?
"
"4","9","Cartman","Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
"
"4","9","Cartman","But we have to perform!
"
"4","9","Randy","Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
"
"4","10","Stan","Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's...""
"
"4","10","Cartman","""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
"4","10","Stan","We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
"
"4","10","Cartman","Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
"4","10","Butters","Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
"
"4","10","Stan","Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
"
"4","10","Cartman","Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
"4","10","Kyle","Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
"
"4","10","Stan","We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
"
"4","10","Kyle","Oh good. I don't?
"
"4","10","Butters","Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
"
"4","10","Stan","I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"
"4","10","Stan","The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
"
"4","10","Cartman","Who's in there?
"
"4","10","Cartman","And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
"4","10","Cartman","Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
"4","10","Cartman","Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
"4","10","Stan","Oh, shit!  Oh!
"
"4","10","Stan","Okay, come on. 
"
"4","10","Stan","...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
"4","10","Stan","Oh no! It's locked!
"
"4","10","Cartman","What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
"4","10","Cartman","Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
"4","10","Cartman","We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
"
"4","10","Cartman","It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
"
"4","11","Butters","He had sins that he didn't confess!
"
"4","11","Cartman","Praise God-uh!
"
"4","11","Stan","There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"
"4","11","Stan","Yeah!
"
"4","11","Cartman","Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
"
"4","11","Cartman","Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
"4","11","Cartman","Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
"4","11","Cartman","Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
"
"4","11","Cartman","Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
"4","11","Cartman","Uh-oh.
"
"4","11","Kyle","Serves you right, Cartman!
"
"4","11","Stan","Yeah!
"
"4","12","Kyle","Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
"
"4","12","Kyle","Together we are strong! 
"
"4","12","Stan","...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
"
"4","12","Cartman","I'm trying.
"
"4","12","Cartman","You guys are all such pussies!
"
"4","12","Cartman","Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
"4","12","Cartman","Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
"4","12","Cartman","We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
"4","12","Cartman","You're damn right they do!
"
"4","12","Stan","Timmy, you have to stop!
"
"4","12","Stan","Over here, over here!
"
"4","12","Stan","Less than 20 minutes?!
"
"4","12","Cartman","Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems.""
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them.""
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","You will be! You will be!  You will be.
"
"4","12","Cartman","Who the hell cares?!
"
"4","12","Kyle","Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
"
"4","12","Cartman","God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
"
"4","12","Stan","Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
"
"4","12","Stan","Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
"
"4","12","Cartman","Touché, teacher. Touché.
"
"4","12","Cartman","What??
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! 
"
"4","12","Mr. Garrison","Yeah, it feels really good!
"
"4","13","Cartman","He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
"4","13","Kyle","Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
"
"4","13","Stan","Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
"
"4","13","Stan","Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"
"4","13","Cartman","Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
"4","13","Cartman","You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
"
"4","13","Cartman","Got ya! 
"
"4","13","Cartman","Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
"4","13","Cartman","You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","Oh, will you grow up?!
"
"4","13","Stan","Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"
"4","13","Cartman","Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
"4","13","Cartman","Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
"4","13","Kyle","Here we go again.
"
"4","13","Kyle","Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"
"4","13","Stan","You break it down!
"
"4","13","Kyle","You ba--! 
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. 
"
"4","13","Stan","He is in there.
"
"4","13","Kyle","I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
"
"4","13","Kyle","No!
"
"4","13","Kyle","I can't reach the CPU.
"
"4","13","Mr. Garrison","Ohuh... Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
"
"4","14","Kyle","We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
"
"4","14","Cartman","Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
"
"4","14","Cartman","Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
"
"4","14","Kyle","Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
"
"4","14","Cartman","Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
"4","14","Cartman","No no! 
"
"4","14","Cartman","Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
"4","14","Kyle","Timmy, we already got a turkey.
"
"4","14","Cartman","Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
"4","14","Cartman","I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
"4","14","Cartman","Union Mafia bastards! 
"
"4","14","Kyle","He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
"
"4","14","Cartman","What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
"
"4","14","Mr. Garrison","And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami.""
"
"4","14","Mr. Garrison","Alright, see you next year, parents. 
"
"4","14","Kyle","Butters told us their play was awesome! 
"
"4","15","Kyle","Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
"
"4","15","Cartman","Fat camp?
"
"4","15","Kyle","Aw, dude, check this out. 
"
"4","15","Stan","That's so gross.
"
"4","15","Cartman","Don't touch me! 
"
"4","15","Cartman","Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
"
"4","15","Kyle","Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
"
"4","15","Stan","Did you like the old one?
"
"4","15","Stan","Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
"
"4","15","Kyle","Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
"
"4","15","Stan","Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
"
"4","15","Kyle","Six hours.
"
"4","15","Stan","I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
"
"4","15","Kyle","...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
"
"4","15","Kyle","Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
"
"4","15","Cartman","...65, 66, 67... 
"
"4","16","Kyle","Hepatitis B?
"
"4","16","Kyle","My parents said I can't go.
"
"4","16","Stan","Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
"
"4","16","Cartman","Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
"4","16","Kyle","No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
"
"4","16","Kyle","I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
"
"4","16","Kyle","But that's not fair! You lied to me!
"
"4","16","Kyle","It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
"
"4","16","Stan","Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
"
"4","16","Cartman","You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
"4","16","Cartman","Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.
"
"4","16","Cartman","Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
"
"4","16","Stan","You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
"
"4","16","Cartman","Seize her! 
"
"4","16","Kyle","Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
"
"4","16","Cartman","Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
"
"4","16","Cartman","I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
"
"4","16","Stan","No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
"
"4","16","Cartman","We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
"
"4","16","Butters","Oh boy, here it comes!
"
"4","16","Stan","He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
"
"4","16","Butters","Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
"
"4","16","Kyle","Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
"
"4","16","Butters","Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
"
"4","16","Kyle","Sure. 
"
"4","17","Kyle","Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
"
"4","17","Kyle","Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"
"4","17","Stan","Ho-o-oh.
"
"4","17","Kyle","It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
"
"4","17","Kyle","Hey, look.  Hello?
"
"4","17","Cartman","Anything for more presents!
"
"4","17","Cartman","Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
"
"4","17","Kyle","We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
"
"4","17","Stan","It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
"
"4","17","Kyle","You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"
"4","17","Stan","Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
"
"4","17","Cartman","I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 
"
"4","17","Kyle","See ya! 
"
"4","17","Kyle","What's a hard p?
"
"4","17","Kyle","We wish- 
"
"4","17","Cartman","...deh..OOOWW!!!
"
"4","17","Kyle","What?
"
"4","17","Stan","Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
"4","17","Kyle","Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
"
"4","17","Stan","That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
"
"4","17","Kyle","Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
"
"4","17","Kyle","Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
"
"4","17","Stan","Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
"
"4","17","Kyle","You sit- 
"
"4","17","Stan","We sit.
"
"4","17","Kyle","All that work!
"
"4","17","Stan","For nothing.
"
"4","17","Kyle","...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
"
"4","17","Stan","Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
"
"4","17","Cartman","Yeah, ham.
"
"4","17","Randy","That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
"
"5","1","Kyle","What?
"
"5","1","Kyle","Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
"5","1","Kyle","It's stupid!
"
"5","1","Randy","Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
"
"5","1","Kyle","Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
"5","1","Mr. Garrison","Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! 
"
"5","1","Cartman","Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
"
"5","1","Mr. Garrison","And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?
"
"5","1","Stan","What's meecrob?
"
"5","1","Cartman","You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
"
"5","1","Stan","Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
"
"5","1","Cartman","You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"
"5","1","Kyle","We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!
"
"5","1","Kyle","Now what?
"
"5","1","Kyle","We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
"5","1","Stan","Look, there's the F-word.
"
"5","1","Mr. Garrison","Is this still part of the show?
"
"5","1","Stan","Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
"
"5","2","Cartman","Yeah, he's excited.
"
"5","2","Butters","Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
"
"5","2","Randy","He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
"
"5","2","Stan","Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. 
"
"5","2","Stan","Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
"
"5","2","Randy","That's better.
"
"5","2","Randy","See ya, Mr. Grazier. 
"
"5","2","Stan","Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
"
"5","2","Cartman","Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
"
"5","2","Stan","What do we want?
"
"5","2","Stan","When do we want it?
"
"5","2","Randy","Oh, no.
"
"5","2","Cartman","Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
"
"5","2","Stan","Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
"
"5","2","Stan","Jesus Christ, dude! 
"
"5","2","Stan","Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
"
"5","2","Butters","Me neither. 
"
"5","3","Cartman","Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
"
"5","3","Kyle","So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
"
"5","3","Cartman","Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
"
"5","3","Kyle","But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
"
"5","3","Stan","I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. 
"
"5","3","Stan","Move out of the way.
"
"5","3","Stan","Okay, it's all clear. 
"
"5","3","Kyle","It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
"
"5","3","Stan","A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
"
"5","3","Kyle","Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
"
"5","3","Stan","Oh wait, who am I again?
"
"5","3","Kyle","Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
"5","3","Cartman","Cool. 
"
"5","3","Cartman","He's going to eat his own head.
"
"5","3","Kyle","I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
"5","3","Stan","This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
"
"5","3","Stan","That's it? That's how you did that trick?
"
"5","3","Stan","But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
"
"5","3","Stan","Super best friends?
"
"5","3","Kyle","Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
"5","3","Kyle","Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
"5","3","Kyle","I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
"
"5","3","Kyle","What have you done, Cartman?!
"
"5","3","Cartman","But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
"
"5","3","Stan","Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
"5","3","Cartman","Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
"
"5","4","Kyle","What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
"5","4","Cartman","Here, check 'em out.
"
"5","4","Stan","What??
"
"5","4","Cartman","I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
"
"5","4","Cartman","Uh oo what?
"
"5","4","Cartman","You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
"
"5","4","Cartman","Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
"
"5","4","Cartman","Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
"
"5","4","Cartman","You will? Oh, cool!
"
"5","4","Cartman","Right.
"
"5","4","Kyle","One please.
"
"5","4","Stan","One please.
"
"5","4","Cartman","Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
"
"5","4","Cartman","Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
"
"5","4","Cartman","Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 
"
"5","4","Cartman","Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
"
"5","4","Cartman","Aaah!!!
"
"5","4","Cartman","Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
"
"5","4","Stan","Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
"
"5","4","Cartman","Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! 
"
"5","4","Cartman","No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
"
"5","4","Cartman","Not like that, pony! 
"
"5","4","Cartman","I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
"
"5","4","Stan","Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
"
"5","4","Cartman","That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
"
"5","4","Kyle","Scott Tenorman?
"
"5","4","Kyle","'Cause we hate him.
"
"5","4","Cartman","Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
"
"5","4","Cartman","Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
"
"5","4","Cartman","What's so funny?
"
"5","4","Cartman","I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""
"
"5","5","Kyle","Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
"
"5","5","Cartman","You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
"
"5","5","Cartman","Awesome! Give me mine! 
"
"5","5","Kyle","What??
"
"5","5","Kyle","Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
"5","5","Stan","Huh?
"
"5","5","Stan","Uuuuhh.
"
"5","5","Cartman","Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
"
"5","5","Stan","You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
"
"5","5","Stan","But where's Phillip?
"
"5","5","Stan","Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
"
"5","5","Kyle","But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
"5","5","Kyle","Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
"
"5","5","Cartman","Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
"
"5","5","Cartman","Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
"
"5","5","Kyle","You bastards!
"
"5","5","Cartman","We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
"
"5","5","Kyle","Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
"5","6","Cartman","God! She didn't take this long to die.
"
"5","6","Cartman","Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"
"5","6","Stan","Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
"
"5","6","Stan","Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
"
"5","6","Cartman","HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
"
"5","6","Cartman","Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
"
"5","6","Kyle","Where are we going?
"
"5","6","Stan","We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
"
"5","6","Cartman","Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
"
"5","6","Stan","Come on, dude!
"
"5","6","Stan","Dude, are you okay?
"
"5","6","Kyle","But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
"5","6","Cartman","I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
"
"5","6","Cartman","Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!
"
"5","6","Cartman","Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
"
"5","6","Stan","AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!
"
"5","6","Cartman","Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
"
"5","6","Kyle","Awesome. 
"
"5","6","Kyle","And that's it? That's the end?
"
"5","6","Cartman","Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
"
"5","7","Stan","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
"5","7","Cartman","I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
"
"5","7","Cartman","I told you guys.
"
"5","7","Stan","Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
"
"5","7","Cartman","Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
"
"5","7","Randy","Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
"
"5","7","Stan","No!
"
"5","7","Stan","It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
"
"5","7","Butters","Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
"
"5","7","Kyle","Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
"5","7","Kyle","Oh my God, dude.
"
"5","7","Kyle","Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
"5","7","Butters","Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
"
"5","7","Butters","Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes""
"
"5","7","Kyle","Uh, what are ""studzes""
"
"5","7","Cartman","Just put it on, Butters.
"
"5","7","Butters","Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
"
"5","7","Kyle","It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
"5","7","Butters","But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
"
"5","7","Butters","Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
"
"5","7","Mr. Garrison","NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
"
"5","7","Stan","Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
"
"5","7","Stan","All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
"
"5","7","Cartman","I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
"
"5","7","Cartman","Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
"
"5","7","Mr. Garrison","Jesus Christ. 
"
"5","8","Kyle","HA! I killed you!
"
"5","8","Stan","HA, I blew your head off!
"
"5","8","Stan","Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
"
"5","8","Cartman","Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
"
"5","8","Cartman","This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
"
"5","8","Cartman","Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
"
"5","8","Stan","...O-kay.
"
"5","8","Kyle","Uh no.
"
"5","8","Stan","Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
"
"5","8","Cartman","That's... so... cool!
"
"5","8","Stan","Oh, uh, I'm sick.
"
"5","8","Stan","Can't believe we have to go to school!
"
"5","8","Kyle","Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
"5","8","Stan","What? Who-who is this?
"
"5","8","Cartman","Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
"
"5","8","Kyle","Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
"5","8","Cartman","No it isn't.
"
"5","8","Stan","Dude, don't you remember where it is?
"
"5","8","Kyle","The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
"5","8","Stan","Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
"
"5","8","Stan","We... don't... care.
"
"5","8","Cartman","Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
"
"5","8","Kyle","Dude, I figured it out.
"
"5","8","Stan","What?
"
"5","8","Cartman","Yeah, and you're a towel!
"
"5","8","Kyle","That's it?
"
"5","8","Kyle","Our GameSphere! 
"
"5","8","Stan","Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. 
"
"5","8","Stan","Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
"
"5","8","Kyle","I got it! 
"
"5","8","Kyle","Awesome!
"
"5","9","Cartman","...Not really.
"
"5","9","Butters","Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
"
"5","9","Kyle","These are gas masks, Butters!
"
"5","9","Stan","Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
"
"5","9","Cartman","Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
"
"5","9","Cartman","That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
"
"5","9","Kyle","Dude, what's going on?
"
"5","9","Stan","We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
"
"5","9","Kyle","Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
"5","9","Stan","Kenny?
"
"5","9","Stan","They're not.
"
"5","9","Stan","Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
"
"5","9","Stan","Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
"
"5","9","Cartman","Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
"
"5","9","Cartman","Uh ho, you guys.
"
"5","9","Kyle","Is this the right house?
"
"5","9","Stan","I think so. 
"
"5","9","Kyle","Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
"5","9","Stan","Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
"
"5","9","Kyle","Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
"5","9","Kyle","Cartman, where are you going??
"
"5","9","Cartman","So that's what this is all about?
"
"5","9","Stan","...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
"
"5","9","Cartman","Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
"
"5","9","Stan","Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
"
"5","9","Kyle","Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
"5","9","Stan","Yeah, go Broncos.
"
"5","9","Cartman","Yeah. 
"
"5","10","Cartman","Yes it is! 
"
"5","10","Kyle","But I never take off my hat.
"
"5","10","Kyle","Gay-ass. 
"
"5","10","Cartman","Uh oh. 
"
"5","10","Butters","Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
"
"5","10","Cartman","Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
"
"5","10","Cartman","Yes, I have it right hmya. 
"
"5","10","Cartman","And, and big rosy cheeks! 
"
"5","10","Kyle","Hello?
"
"5","10","Stan","That isn't funny, Cartman.
"
"5","10","Cartman","Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
"
"5","10","Kyle","Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
"5","10","Stan","No way! 
"
"5","10","Kyle","Uh
"
"5","10","Stan","Oh boy.
"
"5","10","Cartman","It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
"
"5","10","Butters","Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
"
"5","10","Butters","Another week?  I hate my stupid face.
"
"5","10","Cartman","I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
"
"5","10","Cartman","...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
"
"5","10","Cartman","...naw, that didn't work either.
"
"5","10","Cartman","And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
"
"5","10","Kyle","Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
"5","10","Kyle","Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
"5","10","Stan","Huh?
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
"
"5","11","Kyle","Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
"
"5","11","Cartman","Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
"
"5","11","Kyle","Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!
"
"5","11","Cartman","I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
"
"5","11","Kyle","Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
"5","11","Cartman","Oh!
"
"5","11","Kyle","Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. 
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? 
"
"5","11","Randy","Oh, man, it that the IT?
"
"5","11","Kyle","Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
"
"5","11","Randy","Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","Right.
"
"5","11","Randy","So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
"
"5","11","Stan","Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
"
"5","11","Mr. Garrison","Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
"
"5","11","Stan","Damn!
"
"5","12","Cartman","Oh, god dammit!
"
"5","12","Cartman","I'll make you eat your parents!
"
"5","12","Cartman","All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
"
"5","12","Mr. Garrison","Yiou know, those types! Rich people! 
"
"5","12","Mr. Garrison","Alright!
"
"5","12","Mr. Garrison","Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
"
"5","12","Mr. Garrison","Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
"
"5","12","Stan","Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
"
"5","12","Kyle","Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
"5","12","Cartman","Uh huh.
"
"5","12","Cartman","Ey, you did me already!
"
"5","12","Kyle","No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
"5","12","Stan","Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
"
"5","13","Stan","Well that burned a long time.
"
"5","13","Butters","Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
"
"5","13","Butters","Oh, it's all sticky. 
"
"5","13","Kyle","Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
"5","13","Kyle","...What? 
"
"5","13","Stan","Stem cells?
"
"5","13","Kyle","...I hate you so much. 
"
"5","13","Cartman","Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
"
"5","13","Stan","The principal? Aw, come on!
"
"5","13","Randy","They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
"
"5","13","Stan","...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
"
"5","13","Cartman","Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
"
"5","13","Butters","Eh, just about.
"
"5","13","Cartman","Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
"
"5","13","Cartman","Die? Kenny?
"
"5","13","Kyle","Hey dude, how's it going?
"
"5","13","Cartman","We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
"
"5","13","Cartman","Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
"
"5","13","Cartman","I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
"
"5","13","Kyle","...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
"5","13","Kyle","Neat, huh Kenny?
"
"5","13","Kyle","He said his wish is not to die. 
"
"5","13","Stan","Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
"
"5","13","Cartman","Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
"
"5","13","Kyle","He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
"5","13","Kyle","AAARGH! 
"
"5","14","Butters","Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
"
"5","14","Butters","Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .

"
"5","14","Butters","Uh, hey Dad.
"
"5","14","Butters","Little white lies?
"
"5","14","Butters","Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
"
"5","14","Butters","Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
"
"5","14","Butters","Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
"
"5","14","Butters","That's me!
"
"5","14","Butters","That's me!
"
"5","14","Butters","Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's

"
"6","1","Butters","Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
"
"6","1","Butters","Wow.
"
"6","1","Stan","Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
"
"6","1","Cartman","So how long until we can joke about it?
"
"6","1","Butters","Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
"
"6","1","Cartman","Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
"
"6","1","Cartman","Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
"
"6","1","Stan","We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
"
"6","1","Cartman","Sir, we are in business!
"
"6","1","Cartman","Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
"
"6","1","Kyle","Yeah, we're all set.

"6","1","Kyle","Wow! 
"
"6","1","Butters","Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
"
"6","1","Cartman","No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
"
"6","1","Kyle","The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
"
"6","1","Stan","Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
"
"6","1","Butters","Four times, mom.
"
"6","1","Butters","Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
"
"6","1","Butters","Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
"
"6","1","Cartman","Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.

"
"6","1","Butters","Hu-oh! Goody!
"
"6","1","Cartman","Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
"
"6","1","Butters","Hi, Mom and Dad!
"
"6","1","Butters","Aaaa!!

"6","2","Cartman","Look you guys, Butters is asleep.

"6","3","Kyle","Cool!
"
"6","3","Butters","...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
"
"6","3","Kyle","We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
"
"6","3","Stan","Where's you get the balls from?
"
"6","3","Kyle","That looks awesome!
"
"6","3","Cartman","They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
"
"6","3","Cartman","Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls.

"6","3","Butters","Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, ""Hey, there goes Chinballs!"" 
"
"6","3","Cartman","Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
"
"6","3","Cartman","Mmoooomm?
"
"6","3","Cartman","I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
"
"6","3","Stan","I- told them where to find you.

"6","3","Cartman","Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
"
"6","3","Cartman","What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!
"
"6","3","Butters","Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
"
"6","4","Butters","Huh, me neither.
"
"6","4","Cartman","Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
"
"6","4","Kyle","Yeah.
"
"6","4","Stan","Pst, Cartman.
"
"6","4","Cartman","No, Uncle Jesse, no!
"
"6","4","Stan","We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
"
"6","4","Cartman","What? Why?
"
"6","4","Stan","We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
"
"6","4","Cartman","Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
"
"6","4","Kyle","No!
"
"6","4","Stan","Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
"
"6","4","Cartman","Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
"
"6","4","Cartman","O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
"
"6","4","Butters","Huuh what's the matter?
"
"6","4","Kyle","Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"
"6","4","Stan","I don't know.
"
"6","4","Cartman","I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
"
"6","4","Cartman","Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
"
"6","4","Butters","Hey fellas!
"
"6","4","Butters","""Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!""
"
"6","4","Kyle","Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
"
"6","4","Stan","They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
"
"6","4","Kyle","We're with you, dude.
"
"6","4","Stan","Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
"
"6","4","Butters","Oh, sweet Jesus.
"
"6","4","Butters","Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
"
"6","4","Kyle","He might be right, dude.
"
"6","4","Stan","Dude, what are you guys doing?
"
"6","4","Butters","Me neither.
"
"6","4","Stan","That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
"
"6","4","Cartman","Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
"
"6","4","Butters","Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
"
"6","4","Butters","Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
"
"6","4","Kyle","Don't give him anything!
"
"6","4","Stan","What do I say??
"
"6","4","Cartman","Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
"
"6","4","Cartman","Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
"
"6","4","Kyle","Dude! 
"
"6","4","Randy","What?
"
"6","4","Cartman","Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
"
"6","4","Cartman","""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""
"
"6","4","Stan","We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
"
"6","5","Kyle","Look, it's almost time.
"
"6","5","Stan","Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
"
"6","5","Kyle","Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
"
"6","5","Kyle","Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
"
"6","5","Stan","That's worse!
"
"6","5","Cartman","Okay, how about ... that? 
"
"6","5","Cartman","We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
"
"6","5","Kyle","God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
"
"6","5","Cartman","There, you got it, you got it!
"
"6","5","Stan","Oh God-dammit!
"
"6","5","Butters","Whre do we go? Where do we go?
"
"6","5","Stan","But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"
"6","5","Stan","Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
"
"6","5","Cartman","Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
"
"6","5","Kyle","That'd disgusting, dude!
"
"6","5","Kyle","Will your sister let us watch it?
"
"6","5","Stan","She has to! 
"
"6","5","Butters","Oh Jesus! Wait.
"
"6","5","Stan","The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
"
"6","5","Butters","No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
"
"6","5","Kyle","This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
"
"6","5","Stan","Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
"
"6","5","Kyle","The last commercial break is starting!
"
"6","5","Cartman","These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
"
"6","5","Butters","They have to show it! They promised they would!
"
"6","5","Cartman","Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
"
"6","5","Cartman","Yeah, it sure does!
"
"6","6","Cartman","I'll do it.
"
"6","6","Butters","Wuh well, sure. 
"
"6","6","Cartman","Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" 
"
"6","6","Butters","Not working out?
"
"6","6","Cartman","Lame, yes.
"
"6","6","Cartman","Who cares?
"
"6","6","Butters","Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
"
"6","6","Cartman","All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
"
"6","6","Kyle","Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"
"6","6","Cartman","Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
"
"6","6","Cartman","Next?
"
"6","6","Butters","Ms. Choksondik,
"
"6","6","Kyle","You're such a fatass, Cartman!
"
"6","6","Butters","It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
"
"6","6","Cartman","Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
"
"6","6","Cartman","Next please.
"
"6","6","Kyle","Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"
"6","6","Stan","Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
"
"6","6","Cartman","I think Towelie is awesome.
"
"6","6","Kyle","Good point. 
"
"6","6","Cartman","Oh, thanks Jimmy
"
"6","6","Butters","Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
"
"6","7","Kyle","Nuh uh.
"
"6","7","Stan","Ready. Let's see 'em.
"
"6","7","Cartman","Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
"
"6","7","Cartman","Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
"
"6","7","Kyle","Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"
"6","7","Stan","Yeah, that'd be funny.
"
"6","7","Cartman","Heheh, okay, okay.
"
"6","7","Butters","Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
"
"6","7","Stan","So what should we do? 
"
"6","7","Butters","Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
"
"6","7","Cartman","Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!
"
"6","7","Kyle","Got it!
"
"6","7","Stan","Let's go! 
"
"6","7","Stan","The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
"
"6","7","Cartman","Do you have them or not?
"
"6","7","Cartman","I see, very interesting. 
"
"6","7","Cartman","Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
"
"6","7","Butters","Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
"
"6","7","Cartman","That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
"
"6","7","Kyle","Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
"
"6","7","Cartman","Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
"
"6","7","Mr. Garrison","That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
"
"6","7","Butters","Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
"
"6","7","Cartman","...So?
"
"6","7","Butters","I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
"
"6","7","Cartman","Why can't societies just live in peace?
"
"6","8","Butters","Compassionate.
"
"6","8","Cartman","Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
"
"6","8","Kyle","Hm. 
"
"6","8","Stan","What?
"
"6","8","Cartman","It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
"
"6","8","Cartman","Have you ever tried it?
"
"6","8","Cartman","Hold on!  God, let a man crap!
"
"6","8","Kyle","Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
"
"6","8","Kyle","Get the fuck out of here!
"
"6","8","Randy","Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
"
"6","8","Kyle","Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
"
"6","8","Kyle","HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
"6","8","Randy","That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
"
"6","8","Cartman","O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
"
"6","8","Randy","He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
"
"6","8","Stan","Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"
"6","9","Stan","No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
"
"6","9","Kyle","""Free hat?""
"
"6","9","Stan","Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
"
"6","9","Cartman","Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
"
"6","9","Cartman","Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
"
"6","9","Stan","Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
"
"6","9","Stan","You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
"
"6","9","Stan","Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
"
"6","9","Kyle","Me.
"
"6","9","Kyle","We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
"
"6","9","Cartman","Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
"6","9","Stan","Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
"
"6","9","Cartman","Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
"
"6","9","Cartman","People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
"
"6","9","Kyle","This looks like the right room.
"
"6","9","Kyle","Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
"6","9","Cartman","Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
"
"6","9","Cartman","Oh, do we wanna do that?
"
"6","9","Kyle","When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
"
"6","9","Kyle","What??
"
"6","10","Cartman","Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
"
"6","10","Cartman","Yes Mom?
"
"6","10","Cartman","But I wanna plaaayyy.
"
"6","10","Kyle","Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
"
"6","10","Stan","Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
"
"6","10","Butters","Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
"
"6","10","Cartman","It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
"
"6","10","Stan","Ah, hey, Bebe.
"
"6","10","Butters","Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
"
"6","10","Kyle","Yeah, it's cool.
"
"6","10","Stan","So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
"
"6","10","Kyle","I'm showing her.
"
"6","10","Kyle","Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
"
"6","10","Stan","Hoh hoh hoh!
"
"6","10","Kyle","We were throwing rocks at cars.
"
"6","10","Cartman","Woohoo.
"
"6","10","Butters","Me too!
"
"6","10","Stan","Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
"
"6","10","Cartman","God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"
"6","10","Stan","Yeah.
"
"6","10","Cartman","And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
"
"6","10","Butters","Uhyep.
"
"6","10","Kyle","I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
"
"6","10","Stan","Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
"
"6","10","Stan","Is Bebe home?
"
"6","10","Cartman","Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
"
"6","10","Cartman","Now say it again, louder.
"
"6","10","Cartman","Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""
"
"6","10","Stan","Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
"
"6","10","Stan","Ahta. Ah, ahta!
"
"6","10","Randy","Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
"
"6","10","Stan","Ahta? 
"
"6","10","Randy","I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
"
"6","10","Kyle","Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
"
"6","10","Cartman","So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
"
"6","11","Stan","Huh?
"
"6","11","Randy","Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
"
"6","11","Kyle","You're such a fatass, Cartman.
"
"6","11","Stan","Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
"
"6","11","Randy","Sweetheart, you saw the news...
"
"6","12","Cartman","You bet your fat clown ass it is!
"
"6","12","Cartman","Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?
"
"6","12","Stan","We've gotta find that ticket!
"
"6","12","Kyle","Yeah. Closure.
"
"6","12","Kyle","There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
"
"6","12","Kyle","Is he in there?
"
"6","12","Stan","I can't see. 
"
"6","12","Cartman","What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
"
"6","12","Cartman","Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
"
"6","12","Kyle","A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
"
"6","12","Kyle","Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
"
"6","12","Kyle","Cartman? Cartman?!
"
"6","12","Cartman","Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
"
"6","12","Stan","No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
"
"6","12","Cartman","Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
"
"6","12","Cartman","Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
"
"6","12","Cartman","What did you say?!
"
"6","12","Kyle","You're too fat to be Kenny.
"
"6","12","Cartman","Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
"
"6","12","Kyle","You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
"
"6","12","Kyle","Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
"
"6","12","Cartman","Looks like I've come to the right place.
"
"6","12","Cartman","Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
"
"6","12","Stan","Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!"
"6","12","Kyle","Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
"6","12","Cartman","You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!"
"6","12","Kyle","What do you mean, fatass?
"
"6","12","Randy","Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
"
"6","12","Kyle","Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
"
"6","12","Cartman","...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.
"
"6","12","Kyle","Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
"
"6","12","Stan","Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"
"6","12","Cartman","No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
"
"6","12","Kyle","Stop him, Kenny! 
"
"6","13","Cartman","It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
"
"6","13","Randy","You wanna go watch?
"
"6","13","Kyle","Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"
"6","13","Randy","Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
"
"6","13","Randy","Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
"
"6","13","Cartman","Prepare for battle! 
"
"6","13","Randy","Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?
"
"6","13","Cartman","This sounds like a really important quest.
"
"6","13","Kyle","Gentlemen, we are off! 
"
"6","13","Butters","Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 
"
"6","13","Kyle","The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
"
"6","13","Cartman","Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
"
"6","13","Butters","Well, then... then let me go with you.
"
"6","13","Kyle","Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"
"6","13","Butters","Let me have the tape!
"
"6","13","Cartman","And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
"
"6","13","Butters","They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
"
"6","13","Kyle","Hide! 
"
"6","13","Kyle","Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
"
"6","13","Randy","I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 
"
"6","13","Stan","We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
"
"6","13","Cartman","Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
"
"6","13","Stan","No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
"
"6","13","Cartman","Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
"
"6","13","Kyle","We were almost killed.
"
"6","13","Stan","Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
"
"6","13","Kyle","Hey, what are you guys doing? 
"
"6","13","Cartman","Ha!! Fags! 
"
"6","13","Cartman","Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
"
"6","13","Kyle","Jimmy, are you sure?
"
"6","13","Kyle","Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
"
"6","13","Butters","The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
"
"6","13","Butters","Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
"
"6","13","Randy","I know where it is! 
"
"6","13","Butters","It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
"
"6","13","Cartman","The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
"
"6","13","Cartman","And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
"
"6","13","Randy","That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","I'm aware of that.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?
"
"6","14","Kyle","Not him!
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.
"
"6","14","Kyle","Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 
"
"6","14","Randy","Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
"
"6","14","Butters","Sure. 
"
"6","14","Stan","Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
"
"6","14","Kyle","We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. 
"
"6","14","Cartman","Nothing.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Say, Mr. Slave.
"
"6","14","Mr. Garrison","Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
"
"6","15","Stan","Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
"
"6","15","Stan","No, that's Kenny.
"
"6","15","Cartman","What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
"
"6","15","Cartman","He's gone again.
"
"6","15","Kyle","We have a dead friend.
"
"6","15","Cartman","Kenny!
"
"6","15","Kyle","Oh my God!
"
"6","15","Kyle","Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
"
"6","15","Stan","Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
"
"6","15","Stan","Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
"
"6","15","Cartman","Thanks, asshole.
"
"6","15","Kyle","Four white birds!
"
"6","15","Stan","Huh?
"
"6","15","Kyle","I'm not going back.
"
"6","15","Stan","What??
"
"6","15","Stan","Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
"
"6","15","Stan","Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
"
"6","15","Stan","Then you're a stupid douche
"
"6","15","Stan","What?! 
"
"6","15","Stan","Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"
"6","15","Stan","No, it can't be.
"
"6","16","Kyle","Throw it away, Clyde!
"
"6","16","Kyle","What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
"
"6","16","Kyle","...Where did you have sex with her?
"
"6","16","Randy","Who is it, Sharon?
"
"6","16","Stan","Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
"
"6","16","Stan","No.
"
"6","16","Cartman","Who's this asshole?
"
"6","16","Kyle","'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
"
"6","16","Stan","I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
"
"6","16","Stan","Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
"
"6","16","Stan","Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
"
"6","16","Stan","Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
"
"6","16","Stan","I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
"
"6","16","Stan","They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
"
"6","16","Stan","What?
"
"6","16","Butters","Now you know my terrible secret!
"
"6","16","Stan","Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
"
"6","16","Stan","Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
"
"6","16","Stan","God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
"
"6","16","Cartman","Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
"
"6","16","Stan","Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
"
"6","16","Cartman","God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
"
"6","16","Cartman","Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
"
"6","16","Butters","Poop- poop swatches?
"
"6","16","Cartman","Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
"
"6","16","Butters","Well that sounds good.
"
"6","16","Cartman","Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
"
"6","16","Stan","Yeah!
"
"6","16","Cartman","And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
"
"6","16","Stan","Hide and go seek, huh?!
"
"6","16","Randy","Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
"
"6","16","Stan","But I have to know for sure. 
"
"6","16","Randy","Stan...
"
"6","16","Cartman","Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
"
"6","16","Butters","Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 
"
"6","16","Butters","We are?
"
"6","16","Butters","Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
"
"6","16","Stan","Get the fuck out of here. 
"
"6","16","Randy","Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
"
"6","16","Stan","Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
"
"6","17","Cartman","Yeah, so how's it look?
"
"6","17","Cartman","Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
"
"6","17","Cartman","Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
"
"6","17","Cartman","Jesus Christ!
"
"6","17","Cartman","I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
"
"6","17","Cartman","Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
"
"6","17","Mr. Garrison","Oh no. 
"
"6","17","Kyle","Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
"
"6","17","Kyle","But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
"
"6","17","Cartman","Wow!
"
"6","17","Stan","Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
"
"6","17","Stan","I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
"
"6","17","Kyle","What are you doing?
"
"6","17","Cartman","Jesus!
"
"6","17","Kyle","We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"
"6","17","Kyle","On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
"
"6","17","Randy","Stan!
"
"6","17","Kyle","Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"
"6","17","Stan","We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"
"6","17","Stan","Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
"
"6","17","Cartman","Oh, God-damnit!
"
"6","17","Stan","Oh, hey Kenny.
"
"7","1","Cartman","Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
"7","1","Kyle","Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
"
"7","1","Cartman","Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
"7","1","Stan","No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
"
"7","1","Cartman","No I don't remember that!
"
"7","1","Kyle","Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
"
"7","1","Kyle","Weird
"
"7","1","Kyle","Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"
"7","1","Stan","You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
"
"7","1","Kyle","And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
"
"7","1","Kyle","I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
"
"7","1","Cartman","Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
"
"7","1","Cartman","Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
"7","1","Kyle","No!
"
"7","1","Cartman","This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
"7","1","Kyle","It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
"
"7","1","Cartman","Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
"7","1","Kyle","Candy bars?
"
"7","1","Kyle","Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
"
"7","1","Stan","Let's go!
"
"7","1","Stan","Chef! End of the road! 
"
"7","1","Kyle","What the? Where are, where are we?
"
"7","1","Stan","We're in the alien ship.
"
"7","1","Cartman","Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
"7","1","Stan","My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
"
"7","1","Stan","I like it.
"
"7","1","Kyle","Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
"
"7","1","Stan","Oh shit, did we do that?
"
"7","1","Stan","Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
"
"7","2","Butters","Hey Jimmy.
"
"7","2","Butters","Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
"
"7","2","Stan","Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
"
"7","2","Kyle","Cartman, just stay out of it.
"
"7","2","Mr. Garrison","What an inspiration.
"
"7","2","Kyle","Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
"
"7","2","Stan","Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
"
"7","3","Kyle","A reindeer?
"
"7","3","Cartman","What a crime. 
"
"7","3","Butters","I love our class!
"
"7","3","Cartman","You can't do that!
"
"7","3","Cartman","Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
"7","3","Kyle","We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
"
"7","3","Kyle","We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
"
"7","3","Kyle","Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
"
"7","3","Kyle","Why are they doing us one at a time?
"
"7","3","Kyle","Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
"7","3","Cartman","No need. I have one for you right here. 
"
"7","3","Cartman","Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
"7","3","Cartman","Why not?
"
"7","3","Kyle","A boat ride?
"
"7","3","Kyle","I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
"7","3","Kyle","They did?
"
"7","3","Stan","They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
"
"7","3","Butters","Yep. I'm in jail.
"
"7","3","Kyle","You con-fessed?
"
"7","3","Butters","You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
"
"7","3","Kyle","I know.
"
"7","3","Cartman","For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
"7","3","Butters","Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
"
"7","3","Stan","What is it, Cartmam? 
"
"7","3","Cartman","It's over this way! Come on!
"
"7","3","Kyle","You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
"
"7","3","Kyle","That's not fair!
"
"7","3","Cartman","I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
"7","4","Mr. Garrison","Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
"
"7","4","Butters","Mmuh well, not really, no.
"
"7","4","Kyle","Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
"
"7","4","Cartman","Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
"7","4","Cartman","Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
"7","4","Kyle","Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
"
"7","4","Cartman","But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
"7","4","Cartman","Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
"7","4","Stan","Oh, no, nononono.
"
"7","4","Stan","Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
"
"7","4","Stan","Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
"
"7","4","Randy","I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
"
"7","4","Cartman","Wow!
"
"7","4","Cartman","I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""
"
"7","4","Randy","Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
"
"7","5","Cartman","Jeh-
"
"7","5","Cartman","Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
"
"7","5","Cartman","Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
"7","5","Cartman","Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
"
"7","5","Stan","Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
"
"7","5","Cartman","Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
"
"7","5","Cartman","All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
"
"7","5","Cartman","Yeah, I wanna leave.
"
"7","5","Cartman","What? What?
"
"7","5","Cartman","Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
"7","5","Stan","What are you gloating about?
"
"7","5","Cartman","Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
"
"7","5","Butters","Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
"
"7","5","Mr. Garrison","Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! 
"
"7","5","Cartman","I'm sure it was just a mistake.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Moooommm!
"
"7","5","Cartman","I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Aww crap.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
"
"7","5","Cartman","What news?
"
"7","5","Cartman","Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
"7","5","Stan","What's she doing?
"
"7","5","Kyle","YES, dude! 
"
"7","5","Stan","Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
"
"7","5","Cartman","Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
"
"7","5","Kyle","Oh no, no, nonono.
"
"7","6","Cartman","Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
"7","6","Kyle","I think we can piece this case together now.
"
"7","6","Stan","His plan was to use a hammer.
"
"7","6","Cartman","Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
"7","6","Stan","Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
"
"7","6","Kyle","Do you kow where your doll is?
"
"7","6","Cartman","No sign of forced entry.
"
"7","6","Cartman","You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
"
"7","6","Kyle","How... do you make semen come out?
"
"7","6","Butters","...ow... Ow!
"
"7","6","Kyle","They've got the doll! 
"
"7","6","Stan","Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! 
"
"7","6","Kyle","Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
"
"7","6","Cartman","Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
"
"7","6","Stan","We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
"
"7","6","Kyle","We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
"
"7","6","Stan","Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
"
"7","6","Stan","Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
"
"7","6","Kyle","Better how, dude?
"
"7","6","Stan","Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
"
"7","6","Cartman","We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
"
"7","6","Cartman","Butters?
"
"7","6","Butters","Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
"
"7","6","Kyle","Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
"
"7","6","Cartman","Bang bang bang... 
"
"7","6","Cartman","You did?
"
"7","7","Randy","Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
"
"7","7","Randy","Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
"
"7","7","Kyle","What?? No, no, I mean, I-
"
"7","7","Mr. Garrison","Oh my God.
"
"7","7","Kyle","Native Americans. 
"
"7","7","Stan","Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
"
"7","7","Butters","Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
"
"7","7","Cartman","Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
"7","7","Randy","How can you do this to people?
"
"7","7","Stan","No!
"
"7","7","Stan","Dad.  Good luck.
"
"7","7","Randy","We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
"
"7","7","Mr. Garrison","Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
"
"7","7","Stan","No! We won't let you destroy our town!
"
"7","7","Randy","What do they want?
"
"7","7","Stan","Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
"
"7","7","Stan","Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
"
"7","7","Stan","Dude, who the hell are you?
"
"7","8","Stan","So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
"
"7","8","Cartman","Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
"
"7","8","Kyle","Hey dudes. 
"
"7","8","Stan","Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
"
"7","8","Cartman","We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
"
"7","8","Cartman","Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
"
"7","8","Kyle","I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
"
"7","8","Cartman","...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Huh.
"
"7","8","Randy","Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Not, not like that?
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
"
"7","8","Cartman","Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
"7","8","Stan","Yeah. Wait, what?
"
"7","8","Cartman","You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
"7","8","Cartman","He's not our friend. 
"
"7","8","Kyle","No! Ah!
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Room service. 
"
"7","8","Stan","It is not!
"
"7","8","Randy","Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
"
"7","8","Randy","Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
"
"7","8","Randy","Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
"
"7","8","Kyle","They aren't gay? Then what are they?
"
"7","8","Randy","I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
"
"7","8","Mr. Garrison","Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
"
"7","8","Kyle","What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"
"7","8","Stan","Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
"
"7","9","Stan","Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
"
"7","9","Kyle","Christian rock?!
"
"7","9","Kyle","Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
"
"7","9","Butters","Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
"
"7","9","Kyle","I don't know.  Let me go check. 
"
"7","9","Kyle","We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
"
"7","9","Cartman","Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
"7","9","Butters","Cheese!
"
"7","9","Cartman","Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
"7","9","Stan","Boy, I'll say!
"
"7","9","Cartman","I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
"7","9","Cartman","Who are you?
"
"7","9","Cartman","You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
"7","9","Stan","Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
"
"7","9","Stan","I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
"
"7","9","Kyle","That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""
"
"7","9","Stan","What??
"
"7","9","Kyle","Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
"
"7","9","Stan","Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
"
"7","9","Cartman","Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
"7","9","Cartman","Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
"7","9","Kyle","This is the worst day of my life.
"
"7","9","Kyle","Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
"
"7","10","Kyle","You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
"
"7","10","Mr. Garrison","Look out!! 
"
"7","10","Stan","But they kill people.
"
"7","10","Cartman","My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
"7","10","Cartman","I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
"7","10","Cartman","More old people!
"
"7","10","Mr. Garrison","Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
"
"7","10","Stan","Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
"
"7","10","Randy","Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
"
"7","10","Cartman","Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
"7","10","Kyle","Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
"7","10","Cartman","Yeah!
"
"7","10","Stan","...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
"
"7","10","Cartman","Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
"7","10","Randy","Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
"
"7","10","Stan","Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
"
"7","11","Stan","What's Casa Bonita?
"
"7","11","Cartman","Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
"7","11","Cartman","Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
"7","11","Cartman","Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
"7","11","Cartman","Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
"7","11","Kyle","I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
"
"7","11","Cartman","Hi Kyle. 
"
"7","11","Cartman","Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
"7","11","Cartman","Like what?
"
"7","11","Cartman","Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
"7","11","Kyle","Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
"7","11","Kyle","That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
"7","11","Butters","Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
"
"7","11","Cartman","No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
"7","11","Butters","But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
"
"7","11","Kyle","Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
"7","11","Kyle","I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
"7","11","Kyle","Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
"7","11","Stan","Yeah, it's kinda weird.
"
"7","11","Cartman","Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
"7","11","Stan","Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
"
"7","11","Cartman","UUuuugh!! 
"
"7","11","Butters","Who's coming this way?
"
"7","11","Cartman","They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
"7","11","Butters","But I can't see nothin'.
"
"7","11","Cartman","Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
"7","11","Butters","Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
"
"7","11","Stan","Really?
"
"7","11","Cartman","But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
"7","11","Cartman","Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
"
"7","11","Kyle","Jesus Christ! 
"
"7","11","Cartman","Totally. 
"
"7","12","Mr. Garrison","Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 
"
"7","12","Mr. Garrison","All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? 
"
"7","12","Mr. Garrison","Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? 
"
"7","12","Stan","All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
"
"7","12","Cartman","Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
"
"7","12","Butters","Let him have it, Stan!
"
"7","12","Stan","He's a really nice kid.
"
"7","12","Cartman","You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
"
"7","12","Stan","Who's Joseph Smith? 
"
"7","12","Stan","The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
"
"7","12","Randy","Who are the Harrisons?
"
"7","12","Stan","They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
"
"7","12","Randy","Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
"
"7","12","Randy","Well, no, no, I just-
"
"7","12","Randy","Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
"
"7","12","Randy","All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
"
"7","12","Stan","Wow, you made this?
"
"7","12","Cartman","Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
"7","12","Stan","Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
"
"7","12","Randy","And?  Your turn, Sharon.
"
"7","12","Stan","But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
"
"7","12","Randy","Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
"
"7","12","Stan","...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
"
"7","12","Stan","I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
"
"7","12","Stan","You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
"
"7","12","Cartman","Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
"7","13","Kyle","Dude, this is unbearable.
"
"7","13","Randy","What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 
"
"7","13","Kyle","Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
"7","13","Cartman","Gross dude! 
"
"7","13","Stan","...Whoops.
"
"7","13","Cartman","Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
"7","13","Cartman","Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
"7","13","Kyle","What??
"
"7","13","Kyle","That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
"7","13","Cartman","God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
"7","13","Stan","Yeah, maybe you're right. 
"
"7","13","Cartman","So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
"7","13","Stan","What are you doing, Cartman?
"
"7","13","Cartman","They're going to kill me! 
"
"7","13","Kyle","Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
"7","13","Kyle","Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
"
"7","13","Kyle","No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
"7","13","Stan","Why?
"
"7","13","Mr. Garrison","Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
"
"7","14","Kyle","Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
"7","14","Stan","Over?  Jesus...
"
"7","14","Kyle","No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"
"7","14","Butters","This place is awesome!
"
"7","14","Cartman","Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
"7","14","Cartman","Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
"7","14","Kyle","Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
"
"7","14","Stan","Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
"
"7","14","Butters","Lexus! 
"
"7","14","Kyle","Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
"7","14","Stan","I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
"
"7","14","Stan","There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
"
"7","14","Butters","On my girlfriend.
"
"7","14","Kyle","Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
"7","14","Butters","Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
"
"7","14","Stan","Huh? But you just got dumped
"
"7","14","Butters","Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
"
"7","14","Kyle","Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
"7","14","Stan","Yeah. Let's play ball.
"
"7","15","Kyle","Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
"7","15","Kyle","You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
"
"7","15","Cartman","Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
"7","15","Kyle","It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
"7","15","Kyle","What?
"
"7","15","Kyle","We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
"7","15","Cartman","You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
"7","15","Cartman","Sweet.
"
"7","15","Kyle","Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
"7","15","Stan","Do something, Kyle! 
"
"7","15","Kyle","Hello?
"
"7","15","Kyle","God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
"
"7","15","Stan","What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
"
"7","15","Cartman","Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
"7","15","Kyle","Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
"
"7","15","Kyle","Ike!
"
"7","15","Cartman","Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
"
"7","15","Stan","Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
"
"8","1","Stan","Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
"
"8","1","Stan","Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
"
"8","1","Cartman","I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
"8","1","Stan","Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
"
"8","1","Kyle","Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
"
"8","1","Stan","What's your ninja name, Kenny?
"
"8","1","Cartman","We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
"8","1","Kyle","God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
"
"8","1","Stan","Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
"
"8","1","Cartman","I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
"8","1","Butters","Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
"
"8","1","Kyle","Whoa.
"
"8","1","Cartman","Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
"8","1","Stan","Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
"
"8","1","Butters","Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
"
"8","1","Stan","We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
"
"8","1","Cartman","Dr. Shafley?
"
"8","1","Cartman","Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
"8","1","Kyle","He said, not now, Craig!
"
"8","1","Kyle","Oh no. Butters!
"
"8","1","Butters","Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
"
"8","1","Cartman","Here, Butters!
"
"8","1","Cartman","Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
"8","1","Kyle","Butters!
"
"8","1","Kyle","We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
"
"8","1","Stan","What is it, Craig?
"
"8","1","Kyle","You have that power too?
"
"8","1","Cartman","I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
"8","2","Kyle","They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
"
"8","2","Kyle","Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
"
"8","2","Cartman","Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
"
"8","2","Cartman","Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
"8","2","Stan","That's really, really terrible, dude.
"
"8","2","Cartman","Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
"
"8","2","Kyle","It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
"
"8","2","Cartman","Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
"8","2","Cartman","Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
"
"8","2","Cartman","Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
"8","2","Cartman","Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
"8","2","Cartman","All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
"8","2","Cartman","Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
"8","3","Cartman","All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
"8","3","Cartman","Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
"8","3","Kyle","I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
"
"8","3","Kyle","Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
"
"8","3","Stan","Oh God, here we go again.
"
"8","3","Cartman","Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
"8","3","Stan","That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
"
"8","3","Cartman","Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
"8","3","Kyle","You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
"
"8","3","Stan","That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
"
"8","3","Stan","Hey, we want our money back.
"
"8","3","Stan","You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
"
"8","3","Stan","Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
"
"8","3","Cartman","Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
"8","3","Stan","Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
"
"8","3","Stan","We don't want to torture you.
"
"8","3","Kyle","Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
"
"8","3","Stan","Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
"
"8","3","Stan","Aah! Run, dude, run!
"
"8","3","Cartman","Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
"8","3","Kyle","Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
"
"8","3","Kyle","I saw The Passion!
"
"8","3","Cartman","Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
"8","3","Stan","Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
"
"8","3","Stan","Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
"
"8","3","Stan","Yeah. I told you that!
"
"8","3","Kyle","No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
"
"8","3","Kyle","Dude, what's wrong with him?
"
"8","3","Stan","He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
"
"8","3","Stan","No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
"
"8","4","Cartman","Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
"8","4","Cartman","All right!
"
"8","4","Randy","So what happened?
"
"8","4","Stan","I, I don't know. He seems all right.
"
"8","4","Butters","Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
"
"8","4","Stan","Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
"
"8","4","Stan","And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
"
"8","4","Stan","Butters! 
"
"8","4","Butters","Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!
"
"8","4","Stan","All right Butters!
"
"8","4","Butters","No! No! Noooooo!
"
"8","5","Cartman","Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
"8","5","Butters","Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
"
"8","5","Cartman","That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
"8","5","Butters","Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
"
"8","5","Cartman","Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
"8","5","Butters","Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
"
"8","5","Cartman","You saw that?
"
"8","5","Butters","I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"
"8","5","Cartman","...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
"8","5","Butters","How come?
"
"8","5","Cartman","Oh, son of a bitch!
"
"8","5","Cartman","Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
"8","5","Butters","Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 
"
"8","5","Butters","He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
"
"8","5","Cartman","Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
"8","5","Butters","Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
"
"8","5","Butters","AWESOM-O?
"
"8","5","Cartman","Argh! 
"
"8","5","Butters","Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
"
"8","5","Cartman","AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
"8","5","Butters","Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
"
"8","5","Cartman","Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
"8","5","Cartman","Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
"8","5","Cartman","I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
"8","5","Butters","Hang on a second, here! 
"
"8","5","Cartman","Lame...
"
"8","6","Kyle","Hey Look! 
"
"8","6","Cartman","Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
"8","6","Stan","Whoa. Dude, no way!
"
"8","6","Cartman","Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
"8","6","Kyle","What's wrong with his face?
"
"8","6","Stan","Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
"
"8","6","Kyle","Mr. Jefferson? 
"
"8","6","Cartman","Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
"8","6","Cartman","Choo-choo train! Yay! 
"
"8","6","Cartman","...Train together
"
"8","6","Cartman","Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
"8","6","Kyle","They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
"
"8","6","Cartman","What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
"8","6","Kyle","Come on, Blanket. 
"
"8","6","Cartman","Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
"8","6","Cartman","Yeah? 
"
"8","6","Stan","Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
"
"8","6","Stan","Stop, you fucking lunatic! 
"
"8","6","Cartman","Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
"
"8","6","Stan","All right dude, get in his bed.
"
"8","6","Kyle","Come on!
"
"8","6","Stan","Run, Blanket, Run!
"
"8","7","Kyle","A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
"
"8","7","Cartman","Shoveling accident.
"
"8","7","Kyle","Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
"
"8","7","Stan","All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
"
"8","7","Stan","It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
"
"8","7","Randy","Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
"
"8","7","Stan","People from the future. Right, got it.
"
"8","7","Cartman","We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
"8","7","Randy","Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
"
"8","7","Randy","What?
"
"8","7","Stan","We're doing it!
"
"8","8","Cartman","Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
"8","8","Cartman","Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""
"
"8","8","Kyle","That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
"
"8","8","Butters","Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
"
"8","8","Kyle","You misled him, fatass!
"
"8","8","Cartman","Okay. You win, Kyle.
"
"8","8","Cartman","Game on, Jew-boy!
"
"8","8","Kyle","Giant Douche is your man!
"
"8","8","Stan","Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
"
"8","8","Kyle","What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
"
"8","8","Stan","I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
"
"8","8","Randy","You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
"
"8","8","Stan","""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!
"
"8","8","Kyle","Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
"
"8","8","Stan","Okay. 
"
"8","8","Kyle","...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
"
"8","8","Stan","I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
"
"8","8","Randy","Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
"
"8","8","Stan","Hello? 
"
"8","8","Stan","Wow, you guys really love animals.
"
"8","8","Stan","He said I can stay.
"
"8","8","Stan","I can't. I was banished for not voting.
"
"8","8","Stan","Aaah!
"
"8","8","Randy","So who won, Mr. Mackey?
"
"8","9","Kyle","That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
"
"8","9","Cartman","Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
"8","9","Cartman","Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
"8","9","Kyle","Why, Mr. Farkle?
"
"8","9","Cartman","... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
"8","9","Kyle","Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
"8","9","Randy","Staaaan? 
"
"8","9","Stan","What? D-dad, are are you dying?
"
"8","9","Randy","Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
"
"8","9","Randy","Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
"
"8","9","Kyle","No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
"
"8","9","Kyle","Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
"
"8","9","Randy","Can I help you? 
"
"8","9","Stan","Dad, you're a geologist!
"
"8","9","Stan","Where are they?
"
"8","9","Cartman","Nuh-uh.
"
"8","9","Kyle","All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 
"
"8","9","Cartman","I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
"8","9","Kyle","We want to talk to who's in charge.
"
"8","9","Kyle","All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
"
"8","9","Kyle","Yes, I did!
"
"8","9","Kyle","Yes. I did! 
"
"8","9","Stan","Save it, Grandpa!
"
"8","9","Kyle","I think I see the television department in the back!
"
"8","9","Stan","Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
"
"8","9","Randy","I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
"
"8","9","Stan","There! The television department!
"
"8","9","Stan","We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
"
"8","9","Kyle","The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now! 
"
"8","9","Kyle","Duh.
"
"8","9","Randy","All right, let's not make that mistake again.
"
"8","10","Kyle","Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
"
"8","10","Butters","Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
"
"8","10","Cartman","He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
"
"8","10","Cartman","Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
"8","10","Kyle","Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
"
"8","10","Kyle","Do you know how to start a fire?
"
"8","10","Kyle","Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
"
"8","10","Stan","Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
"
"8","10","Stan","That's true.
"
"8","10","Stan","Yeah, who cares?
"
"8","10","Butters","Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
"
"8","10","Butters","But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
"
"8","10","Cartman","Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
"8","10","Stan","Yeah.
"
"8","10","Kyle","Wait! We'll do it.
"
"8","10","Cartman","Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
"8","10","Stan","How do you know?!
"
"8","10","Cartman","Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
"
"8","10","Kyle","God, I hope this works.
"
"8","10","Stan","Excuse me!
"
"8","10","Kyle","Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
"
"8","10","Cartman","All right!
"
"8","10","Stan","Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
"
"8","10","Kyle","Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 
"
"8","10","Kyle","We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
"
"8","10","Stan","No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
"
"8","10","Cartman","A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
"8","10","Stan","Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! 
"
"8","10","Cartman","Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
"8","10","Stan","What is that?
"
"8","10","Cartman","It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
"8","10","Cartman","Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
"8","10","Stan","Yeah, who cares?
"
"8","11","Cartman","And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
"8","11","Cartman","All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
"8","11","Cartman","Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
"8","11","Stan","Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
"
"8","11","Stan","Hey, look, Craig just walked in. 
"
"8","11","Cartman","You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
"8","11","Kyle","Gah, I just don't get it.
"
"8","11","Cartman","It should be Sexy News.
"
"8","11","Cartman","Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
"8","11","Cartman","Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
"8","11","Stan","No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
"
"8","11","Cartman","Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
"8","11","Stan","Crab people?
"
"8","11","Cartman","They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
"
"8","11","Kyle","Oh, okay.
"
"8","11","Butters","Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
"
"8","11","Stan","You guys. You guys, wake up! 
"
"8","11","Butters","Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
"
"8","11","Kyle","Jesus, you may be right.
"
"8","11","Kyle","So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
"
"8","11","Cartman","And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
"8","11","Kyle","Twenty-two people?! All right!
"
"8","12","Butters","I'm sorry.
"
"8","12","Butters","Before what happens? 
"
"8","13","Kyle","What's going on?
"
"8","13","Stan","Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
"
"8","13","Kyle","Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
"
"8","13","Cartman","Wow!
"
"8","13","Kyle","Cartman, what did you do?!
"
"8","13","Kyle","You don't have any powers!
"
"8","13","Kyle","What?!
"
"8","13","Cartman","I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
"
"8","13","Kyle","Hey! What about this guy?!
"
"8","13","Cartman","It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
"8","13","Cartman","If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
"
"8","13","Cartman","Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
"8","13","Kyle","No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
"
"8","13","Kyle","Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
"
"8","14","Stan","Okay, okay.
"
"8","14","Stan","You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
"
"8","14","Stan","All right, I'm going now. 
"
"8","14","Stan","I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
"
"8","14","Stan","Ugh.
"
"8","14","Stan","Leave me alone!!
"
"8","14","Stan","I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
"
"8","14","Kyle","My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
"
"8","14","Cartman","All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
"8","14","Stan","No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
"
"8","14","Kyle","Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
"
"8","14","Stan","I took them to see how abortions are done.
"
"8","14","Stan","Yeah. Yeah, there is.
"
"9","1","Kyle","I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
"9","1","Kyle","Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
"9","1","Kyle","I know. I deserve it.
"
"9","1","Randy","Believe what?
"
"9","1","Kyle","Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
"9","1","Kyle","Yeah! 
"
"9","1","Stan","Wha-a-a negroplasty??
"
"9","1","Kyle","Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
"9","1","Kyle","But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
"9","1","Kyle","But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
"9","1","Butters","Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!
"
"9","2","Stan","Who are the corporations?
"
"9","2","Cartman","Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
"
"9","2","Cartman","Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
"
"9","2","Cartman","I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
"
"9","2","Cartman","It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
"
"9","2","Cartman","Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
"
"9","2","Cartman","You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
"
"9","2","Randy","Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
"
"9","2","Randy","My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
"
"9","2","Randy","Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
"
"9","2","Stan","So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
"
"9","2","Cartman","We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
"
"9","2","Cartman","I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
"
"9","2","Randy","Vehicle shell holding! 
"
"9","2","Cartman","Come on, come on!
"
"9","2","Randy","Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
"
"9","2","Kyle","We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
"9","2","Stan","What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
"
"9","2","Randy","Nyugh!
"
"9","2","Randy","It's working!
"
"9","2","Kyle","Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
"
"9","2","Cartman","Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
"
"9","3","Cartman","That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
"
"9","3","Stan","Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
"
"9","3","Cartman","We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
"
"9","3","Cartman","Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
"
"9","3","Cartman","Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
"
"9","3","Kyle","What the hell are you doing?!
"
"9","3","Kyle","Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
"9","3","Kyle","Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
"9","3","Stan","This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
"
"9","3","Kyle","We knew you could do it!
"
"9","3","Cartman","This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
"
"9","3","Stan","Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
"
"9","3","Stan","No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
"
"9","3","Kyle","Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
"9","3","Stan","We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
"
"9","3","Cartman","Stupid assholes! 
"
"9","3","Stan","What's ""The Contender""?
"
"9","3","Cartman","Come on, Wing!
"
"9","3","Cartman","She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
"
"9","3","Kyle","Get out!
"
"9","3","Cartman","Who let-?
"
"9","3","Stan","Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 
"
"9","3","Kyle","Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
"9","3","Kyle","You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
"9","3","Stan","You tell 'em, Kyle!
"
"9","3","Kyle","Stupid talent agents!
"
"9","3","Kyle","Yeah.
"
"9","3","Stan","Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
"
"9","3","Kyle","Me too.
"
"9","3","Cartman","Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
"
"9","4","Cartman","Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
"
"9","4","Cartman","Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
"
"9","4","Cartman","(looking bored) Fags!
"
"9","4","Cartman","Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
"
"9","4","Stan","Kenny?
"
"9","4","Cartman","Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
"
"9","4","Kyle","Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
"9","4","Cartman","That's right. Respect our authoritah.
"
"9","4","Cartman","You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
"
"9","5","Randy","Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
"
"9","5","Kyle","Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
"
"9","5","Kyle","I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
"9","5","Butters","Well yeah, but... we usually win.
"
"9","5","Randy","Heeey!
"
"9","5","Randy","Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
"
"9","5","Stan","Damnit!
"
"9","5","Cartman","Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
"
"9","5","Stan","Goddamnit. 
"
"9","5","Stan","Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
"
"9","5","Kyle","There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
"9","5","Randy","I just... don't think I can, all right?
"
"9","5","Randy","I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
"
"9","5","Cartman","I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
"
"9","5","Stan","Wow, he IS great at sucking.
"
"9","5","Cartman","We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
"
"9","5","Stan","Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! 
"
"9","5","Stan","Dad!  You're the greatest. 
"
"9","6","Cartman","She's got Colonel!
"
"9","6","Kyle","The skin's the best part...
"
"9","6","Kyle","That sounds great!
"
"9","6","Kyle","Thanks. 
"
"9","6","Cartman","What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
"
"9","6","Butters","Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!""
"
"9","6","Cartman","Oh my God, and you can hear me??
"
"9","6","Butters","Mrs. Cartman?
"
"9","6","Cartman","It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
"
"9","6","Butters","Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
"
"9","6","Cartman","I can't! Don't you understand?!
"
"9","6","Butters","God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
"
"9","6","Kyle","He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
"9","6","Cartman","I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
"
"9","6","Butters","Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
"
"9","6","Cartman","Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
"
"9","6","Butters","Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
"
"9","6","Butters","Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
"
"9","6","Butters","Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
"
"9","6","Cartman","I told you, Butters. 
"
"9","6","Cartman","Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
"
"9","6","Butters","Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
"
"9","6","Cartman","Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
"
"9","6","Cartman","You sonofabitch Butters!
"
"9","6","Butters","Huh but I thought you were one!
"
"9","7","Butters","Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
"
"9","7","Butters","That's right, Jimmy.
"
"9","7","Cartman","All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""
"
"9","8","Stan","Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
"
"9","8","Cartman","Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
"
"9","8","Stan","You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
"
"9","8","Cartman","I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
"
"9","8","Randy","I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
"
"9","8","Stan","Huh oh. 
"
"9","8","Randy","That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
"
"9","8","Stan","You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
"
"9","8","Cartman","Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
"
"9","8","Stan","Maybe they couldn't get out!
"
"9","8","Cartman","We did!
"
"9","8","Randy","With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
"
"9","8","Stan","Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
"
"9","8","Randy","We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
"
"9","8","Kyle","Huh?
"
"9","8","Stan","Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
"
"9","8","Kyle","Terrorists?
"
"9","8","Stan","No.
"
"9","8","Kyle","...Cartman?
"
"9","8","Stan","...sort of.
"
"9","8","Kyle","Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
"9","8","Randy","All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
"
"9","8","Randy","Stan??
"
"9","8","Stan","Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
"
"9","8","Randy","What is it, son?
"
"9","8","Randy","My son is counting on me!
"
"9","8","Randy","All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
"
"9","8","Kyle","What are you doing?
"
"9","8","Cartman","I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
"
"9","8","Cartman","Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
"
"9","8","Randy","Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh. 
"
"9","8","Stan","No. I broke the dam.
"
"9","8","Cartman","Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
"
"9","8","Stan","I literally broke the dam!
"
"9","8","Stan","I kept it secret, for two days!
"
"9","8","Stan","Ohhh, fuck it!
"
"9","9","Cartman","Video playback initialized. 
"
"9","9","Stan","Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
"
"9","9","Cartman","Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
"
"9","9","Stan","Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
"
"9","9","Cartman","No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
"
"9","9","Stan","All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.
"
"9","9","Butters","Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
"
"9","9","Kyle","Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
"9","9","Butters","AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 
"
"9","9","Cartman","Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
"9","9","Butters","Well, I'm workin' on it.
"
"9","9","Cartman","Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
"
"9","9","Stan","Come on, Butters.
"
"9","9","Cartman","Because I do, Clyde.
"
"9","9","Cartman","Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
"
"9","9","Stan","We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
"
"9","9","Stan","We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
"
"9","9","Cartman","Think of the power!
"
"9","9","Butters","Huh?
"
"9","10","Stan","Fine!
"
"9","10","Cartman","...No.
"
"9","10","Cartman","Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
"
"9","10","Cartman","...No.
"
"9","10","Kyle","Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
"9","10","Stan","What?
"
"9","10","Kyle","Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
"9","10","Stan","What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
"
"9","10","Stan","AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
"9","10","Kyle","Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
"9","10","Stan","Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
"
"9","10","Kyle","Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
"9","10","Stan","Huh?
"
"9","10","Kyle","Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
"9","10","Stan","Come on, buddy, let's go! 
"
"9","10","Kyle","Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
"9","10","Kyle","Thanks dude! 
"
"9","10","Stan","There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
"
"9","10","Kyle","Hang on! Wait! 
"
"9","11","Cartman","Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
"
"9","11","Kyle","That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
"
"9","11","Kyle","It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
"9","11","Butters","That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
"
"9","11","Kyle","Thanks Butters
"
"9","11","Kyle","Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
"9","11","Stan","Sure, for what?
"
"9","11","Kyle","Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
"9","11","Cartman","That's fine, just get it out of the way...
"
"9","11","Cartman","Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
"
"9","11","Cartman","Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
"
"9","11","Cartman","Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
"
"9","11","Cartman","Red Power!
"
"9","11","Cartman","Red Power!
"
"9","11","Kyle","I don't believe it.
"
"9","11","Cartman","Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
"
"9","11","Cartman","We're fine!
"
"9","11","Cartman","Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
"
"9","11","Kyle","Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
"9","11","Kyle","Oh... hey there. 
"
"9","11","Stan","You guys... need... anything? 
"
"9","11","Kyle","Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
"9","11","Stan","I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
"
"9","11","Cartman","My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
"
"9","11","Cartman","Go on then! Say your last words!
"
"9","12","Cartman","Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
"
"9","12","Kyle","So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
"9","12","Stan","I don't know.
"
"9","12","Randy","Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
"
"9","12","Stan","But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
"
"9","12","Randy","Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
"
"9","12","Stan","So, this is gonna make me happy?
"
"9","12","Stan","I took out the garbage yesterday.
"
"9","12","Randy","All right, what the hell is going on here?!
"
"9","12","Randy","Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
"
"9","12","Stan","I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
"
"9","13","Kyle","Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
"
"9","13","Kyle","Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
"9","13","Kyle","South Park.
"
"9","13","Kyle","Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
"9","13","Kyle","Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
"9","13","Stan","What?
"
"9","13","Kyle","Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
"9","13","Kyle","That's terrible!
"
"9","13","Stan","It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
"
"9","13","Kyle","You can? Awesome!
"
"9","13","Cartman","Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
"
"9","13","Kyle","All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
"9","13","Kyle","Okay ma, thanks! 
"
"9","13","Kyle","Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
"9","13","Kyle","Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
"
"9","13","Kyle","But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
"9","13","Stan","Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
"
"9","14","Stan","Wait. Where's my Dad?
"
"9","14","Randy","Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
"
"9","14","Randy","Uh... a disease?
"
"9","14","Stan","Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
"9","14","Randy","No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
"
"9","14","Stan","Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!
"
"9","14","Randy","Stan I... need your help.
"
"9","14","Stan","No! You don't need another beer!
"
"9","14","Randy","I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
"
"9","14","Stan","No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
"
"9","14","Randy","Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
"
"9","14","Stan","Praise Christ.
"
"9","14","Randy","But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
"
"9","14","Randy","What?
"
