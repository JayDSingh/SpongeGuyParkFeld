jerry," You know, why we're here?  To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single 
              most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people 
              talking about ""We should go out""? This is what they're 
              talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. 
              Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' 
              to find us, they don't know where we are.  
              ""Did you ring?, I can't find him.""  ""Where did he go?""  
              ""He didn't tell me where he was going"". He must have gone 
              out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, 
              right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get 
              your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're 
              staring around, whatta you do? You go ""We gotta be getting 
              back"". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to 
              sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? 
              Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go."

jerry," Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. 
               The second button literally makes 
              or breaks the shirt, look at it it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, 
              you look like you live with your mother."
george, Are you through? 
jerry," You do of course try on, when you buy?"
george," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall 
              considering the buttons."
jerry," Oh, you don't recall?"
george,"  Uh, no, not at 
              this time."
jerry," Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when 
              you knew it. "
waitress," Mister Seinfeld.  Mister 
              Costanza. "
george," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?"
waitress," It's missing, I have to do it in my head decaf left, 
              regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging 
              work. "
jerry," Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional 
              waitress."
waitress," Trust me George no one has any interest in seeing you 
              on caffeine. "
george, How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
jerry," Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in."
george," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
              is coming in?"
jerry," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
george," No, you didn't!"
jerry," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political 
              science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... There's no milk in here, what..."
george," Wait wait wait, what is she,  what is she like?"
jerry," Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth 
              about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the 
              conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking 
              with you, but, ya know, obviously much better."
george,"  So, ya know, what, what happened?"
jerry," Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
george," Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
jerry, Yeah.
george, This is great!
jerry, Yeah.
george," So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
              you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
jerry," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
              called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
              maybe we'll get together. "
george,"  Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had 
              to come in""?"
jerry," Yeah, but..."
george," ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? 
              ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?"
jerry, Yeah!
george," No...no...no, I hate to tell you this you're not gonna 
              see this woman."
jerry,"  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
george," How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 
            "
jerry, To be polite? You are insane!
george," All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you 
              wanna know why she called you?"
jerry, Yes!
george," You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
              a B-plan of contingency!"
jerry," Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
george,"  passes the table; George stops her 
              and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a 
              woman, right?"
claire," What gave it away, George?"
george," Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical 
              phone call, ya know, from a female point of view."
jerry,"  Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, 
              how is she gonna know?"
george,"  Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
              she has to  come 
              to New York on business..."
jerry, Oh you are beautiful!  
george," and, and maybe  she'll see me when 
              she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
claire," I'd have to say uuhh, no. "
george,  So why did she call?
claire, To be polite.
george," To be polite, I rest my case."
jerry," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking 
              about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get 
              my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
george, I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
jerry," Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy""."
george," Come on, I'm tired."
claire,"  Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine he'll 
              perk up."
george,"  Right, 
              I knew I felt something...! "
,
george," Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin'...this is the dullest 
              moment I've ever experienced. "
jerry," Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's 
              got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first 
              load."
george," I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the 
              city, I feel so cramped..."
jerry, And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
george, What?!
jerry, Laura.
george," I can't believe  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
              THIS!"
jerry," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
george,"  'Cause it's signals, Jerry , it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask 
              you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
jerry, No.
george," She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? 
              What is that? It's Saturday night!"
jerry, Yeah.
george," What is that? It's ridiculous!  
              You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call 
              her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal!  Signal!"
jerry, Maybe you're right.
george, Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
jerry," This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's 
              staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
george,"  I know, I know. 
               Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
              you just see if it's dried?"
jerry," No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
              it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
george," You're gonna ""overdry"" it."
jerry," You, you can't ""overdry""."
george, Why not?
jerry," Same as you can't ""overwet"".  
              You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead 
              like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and 
              I shoot you you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You 
              can't ""overdie"", you can't ""overdry""."
george,  Any questions?
jerry, How could she not tell me where she was staying? 
george,"  Look at that they're done! It's 
              a miracle! "
,
jerry," ""Laundry-day"" is the only exciting day in the 
              live of clothes. It is...no, think about it the washing machine 
              is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles 
              happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs 
              the underwear ""C'mon babe, let's gather"". You come by, 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              you open up the lid and they'll ...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. 
              They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the 
              boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they 
              all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in 
              the hamper, the night before  ""Tomorrow, the 
              dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!"" The dryer-door swings open 
              and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you 
              don't see him and then he goes down the road . They got buttons sowed on their faces 
              join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent 
              for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? 
              Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains 
              all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe 
              you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first."
,
jerry,"  If you know 
              what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, 
              hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, 
              no  Yeah? "
kramer,  Are you up?
jerry,"  Yeah... Yeah, people do move! 
              Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem 
              ."
kramer," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? "
jerry,"  Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! 
               I taped the game, 
              it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night 
              to watch this."
kramer," Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew... You got any meat?"
jerry,"  Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! 
               Well what, 
              what happened in the game anyway?"
kramer,"  What happened? 
              Well, they STUNK, that's what happened!  Ya know, I almost wound up going to 
              that game."
jerry,"  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't 
              been out of the building in ten years!"
kramer," Yeah.  
              Are you done with this?"
jerry, No.
kramer,"  When you're done, let me know."
jerry," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
kramer, I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
jerry," No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I 
              misread the whole thing."
kramer, You want me to talk to her?
jerry, I don't think so.
kramer," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... 
              a lawyer. "
jerry," That close, huh?"
kramer, You better believe it. 
jerry," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
kramer, Give me it...let me talk to her .
jerry,"  No believe me, I'm always up 
              at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane 
              get in?...I got my friend George to take me......"
kramer, A SLIDE!...Wow!
jerry," ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got 
              it  ten-fifteen...No, 
              don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, 
              it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye.  I, I don't believe it...That, that was 
              her. She wants to stay here!"
,
jerry," If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette 
              in his mouth the whole way.  Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down 
              first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to 
              come down."
george," Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed 
              for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in 
              an extra guy too? "
jerry,"  Look, it's a very awkward situation, 
              I, I don't wanna be presumptuous."
george," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What 
              was the EXACT phrasing of the request?"
jerry," All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room..."
george, A decent hotel-room...
jerry," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient 
              if she stayed at my place."
george," You can't be serious. This is New York city there must 
              be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag?  This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!"
jerry,"  This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, 
              where were you yesterday?"
george," I think I was affected by the caffeine.  HO, HO, HO, 
              GOOD DOG "
kramer,"  He really 
              likes you, George."
george,"  Well, that's flattering. "
kramer,"  Oh, he's getting' a drink of water.  Is this for that girl?"
jerry, Yeah.
kramer, Why even give her an option?
jerry," This is a person I like, it's not ""How to score on 
              spring break""."
george," Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
              a ticket."
jerry," Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
              bathroom."
george, So what? That's good.
jerry," Now, how could that be good?"
george," Because filth is good...Whatta you think rock stars have 
              sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a 
              woman comin' over ""I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these 
              matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS 
              do the opposite."
jerry, This is how you operate?
george," Yeah, I wish."
jerry, Let me just wipe the sink.
kramer,"  WHY EVEN GIVE HER 
              AN OPTION FOR?  It's unbelievable."
george, Yeah.
kramer, ...How's the real estate-business?
george,"... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? 
              Did you need something."
kramer, Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
george," Well, I might be getting in to that."
kramer,  You keep me posted!
george," I'm aware of you, all right, let's go , let's go!  You're on stage in 
              25 minutes."
,
jerry," The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, 
              it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if 
              a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 
              'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what 
              they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they 
              need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one 
              I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no 
              cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never 
              had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been 
              in a situation, when I thought to myself ""I could use a cotton-ball 
              right now""...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need 
              them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, 
              they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen 
              these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, 
              they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, 
              ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em 
              is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, 
              that look like they've been through some horrible experience... 
              tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once 
              went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls 
              over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, 
              I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought 
              maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town 
              ""Let's move on""... The dating world is a world of pressure. 
              Let's face it a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. 
              The only difference between a date and a job-interview is not many 
              job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end 
              of it...ya know ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man 
              for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the 
              people you'll be workin' with?""."
,
jerry," Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's 
              thinking?"
george," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman 
              what she's thinkin'."
jerry," Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective I've gotta pick 
              up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation."
george," Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna 
              know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
jerry, Really? How?
george, 'Cause it's all in the greeting. 
jerry, Uh-huh.
george," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets 
              you, that's a good sign."
jerry, Right.
george," Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is 
              good."
jerry," ""Lip-area""."
george, Ya know a hug definitely good.
jerry, Hug is definitely good.
george, Sure.
jerry," Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders 
              are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
george," That's so brutal, I hate that."
jerry, Ya know how they do that?
george," That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
jerry," Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
              eyes?"
george, Hand-sandwich.
jerry, Right.
george," I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so 
              much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the 
              eyes..."
laura, Guess who?
jerry," Hey, hey."
jerry, It's good to see you.
laura, Hi.
jerry, This is my friend George.
laura,"  Hi, how nice to meet you."
george," Hi, how are you?"
jerry, This is Laura.
george," Laura, sure."
jerry,  I can't believe you're here.
laura," Oh, thank you."
jerry,"  Now that was an interesting greeting, 
              did you notice that, George?"
george," Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That 
              wasn't in the manual, I don't know."
,
jerry," So uh, what do ya think?"
laura," Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad."
jerry," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, 
              make yourself at home.  So uh, can I get 
              you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"
laura,"  Actually uhm, do you have any wine?"
laura," Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? "
jerry," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. "
laura," Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering would it be possible, and 
              if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?"
jerry," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What 
              is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' 
              anything?"
laura," No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the 
              morning, then after that I'm right open."
jerry, Really? What would you like to do?
laura," Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love 
              to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan."
jerry,"  Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. 
               I'm just, I'm really glad you're here.  Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. 
               Uhm, it's for you."

              do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster."
jerry, You're engaged? 
laura," Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to

              I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. 
              I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything 
              they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know 
              what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want 
              women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really 
              is we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, 
              we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is 
              why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. 
              These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is 
              that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man

jerry, Maybe.
goerge," He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the 
              stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed 
              to be a big merger."
jerry, How high's it suppose to go?
george," I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, 
              that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You 
              wanna do it?"
jerry, Boy.. I don't know.

vanessa," I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's 
              a lot of pressure."
jerry," It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting 
              the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months 
              from now we accomplish"
vanessa," Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?"
jerry," Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased

              a lot better in Phase Two."
vanessa,"  Really? Could we go fishing 
              up there?"
jerry," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"
vanessa, They have marlin in Vermont?
jerry," Oh, big fighting marlin."
vanessa," Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. 
              There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still 
              down."
jerry," I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they 
              have, uh, different.. sources."

jerry, Is that my paper?
kramer," Bad news, my friend."
jerry, What? What news?
kramer, Sendrax.
jerry," Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!"
kramer, Two and a half points.
jerry," Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that.  
              That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half 
              my money!"
kramer," Hey, I told ya."
jerry,"  Yeah, you told me."
kramer, It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.

              don't understand. Why does it please you?  George Costanza, 
              please."
kramer," Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to  get 
              rid of that stock, now!"
jerry,"  George, what's going on?!"
kramer," Sell it, just say I'm selling!"
jerry,"  Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half 
              my money's gone.. Well, call me right back.  Nobody can 
              reach Wilkinson. He"
kramer," You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. 
              And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
jerry, Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
kramer," Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting 
              coming up."
jerry, Okay.
kramer," You just  tear it off, and you got a new one 
              right here. Then you're gone."
jerry, You're gone alright.
kramer,"  Hey, where.. where are you going? You 
              gonna take a trip? The map.. what.."
jerry," Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days."
kramer," Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming 
              over this weekend."
jerry, What friends?
kramer," Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert."
kramer," Do you mind if they use your bed?  
              'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, 
              they're anarchists."
jerry," George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, 
              what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. 
               Wilkinson, the guy"
,
jerry, So you don't know what's wrong with him?
george, All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.
jerry," Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?"
george," Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. 
              He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all."
jerry," Well, this is it. I'm selling."
george, Just give it a little more time.
jerry," I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous 
              wreck. I""m not cut out for investing."
george," Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there."
jerry, Where?
george, To the hospital.
jerry, The hospital?
george, I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?
jerry, Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.
george," So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and 
              I'll work my way around to it."
jerry," What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you 
              gonna do?  ""How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? 
               By the"
george, Maybe he's resting.

george," What are you, a doctor?"
jerry," Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?"
george," Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you 
              hear from me."
jerry, Alright.
george,"  Boy, I have to get to 
              a bathroom."
jerry," Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely 
              shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it."
jerry," What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of 
              this shirt?!"
jerry, I can't find the receipt.
jerry," Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had 
              the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do 
              with this?!"
jerry," What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this 
              tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! 
              In fact, forget the money. I don't even"
jerry, No.. dry-cleaned.
jerry,"  You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just 
              tell me that you shrunk it!"
,
jerry," I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I 
              can say to the dry cleaner, ""Well, it's ruined."" And of 
              course, the dry cleaner can respond, ""It's not"

jerry, Bless you.
elaine," Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, 
              anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. 
              My Uncle Pete showers"
jerry, So what are you gonna do?
elaine," I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of 
              course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do 
              you think a hit man would charge to"
jerry," Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks 
              a cat?"
elaine," What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?"
jerry, I'm no cat killer.
elaine, How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
jerry," I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back 
              from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely 
              go."
elaine, He actually wen to the hospital?
jerry, Yeah.
elaine," Oh man, he's nuts."
jerry," Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats.  I know, I know. It's down again."
kramer, How much are you down altogether?
jerry, I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
kramer, Wow.
jerry," You don't have to say ""Wow."" I know it's ""Wow."" 
              And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?"
jerry, It's George. 
kramer," Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. 
              Take a look at this."
jerry, I really don't need to look.
kramer, What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.
jerry," Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger 
              leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up."
kramer, I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. 
jerry," What? What? Did you go down there?  Did he 
              tell you what's gonna happen?  
              How long were you there?"
george, Fifteen seconds.
jerry, You told him you knew Simons?
george," Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the 
              parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell 
              you one thing.. I don't know"
jerry," Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want 
              to think about this. I'm selling."
elaine," Didn't work, huh?"
george,  Not quite.
elaine," Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?"
george, I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.
,
jerry," So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount 
              now."
vanessa, I know. You mentioned it.
jerry," Oh yeah, right.  Oh God. Get me out of here. 
              What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still 
              got another day! I've got"
vanessa," No, it's got a little battery."

              be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail.

vanessa, Not especially.
jerry," Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?"
vanessa, What can we do? It's raining.
jerry," We cold play ""Sorry!"" We cold play ""Steal 
              the Old Man's Bundle.""  Maybe I can get an extension 
              cord and hang myself.  What"
vanessa," Oh, you've never heard of it."
jerry," No, what? What kind is it?"
vanessa, I can't tell you.
jerry,"  Yeah, that's normal.  
              Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?"
vanessa, That stock? I thought you got out of that?
jerry," I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want 
              to check it out.  Six points. It's up six points!"
vanessa, I told you not to sell.
jerry, You did not tell me not to sell.
vanessa," I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?"
jerry," Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody 
              knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!"
vanessa, That's probably why.. 
jerry, What?
vanessa, Forget it.
jerry," No, what? 'That's probably why..'"
vanessa," That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost 
              money on the stock."
jerry,"  So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine 
              hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the 
              name of that purfume.."

              you clear on your little trasaction"
george, I don't like to discuss figures.
jerry, How much?
george," I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get 
              out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson 
              cleaned up."
jerry," So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?"
george," No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly 
              from a nose job."
jerry, Is taht still from the cats?
elaine," No, I just have a cold."
jerry," So, what ever happened with that?"
elaine, I gave him an ultimatum. 
george, He chose the cats?
elaine, They're very clean animals.
jerry," I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat."
elaine, Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
george," I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad 
              you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super 
              speed and reverse time."

kramer, You've never had cantaloupe like this before.
jerry, I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
kramer, Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
jerry, Alright.. 
kramer," Ah, huh. It's good?"
jerry, It's very good.
kramer," Good, huh?"
jerry, Good.
kramer, I got it at Joe's.

              go to Joe's."

              A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?"

              near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen."""
jerry, Ah ha.
george," I said, ""Listen Marlene,"" and then the next thing 
              I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of 
              me going ""You're doing it! You're doing"
jerry," See, it's never as bad as you imagine."
kramer, I liked Marlene. What's her number?
george," No, I, I don't think so."
jerry, Could you stop that smacking?
kramer," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
george," Oh no, thank you."
kramer, It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.
george," No, really. No, no, thanks."
kramer," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is."
jerry," It's very good cantaloupe.  So that's 
              it? You're out?"
george," Except for one small problem. I left some books in her 
              apartment."
jerry," So, go get them."
george," Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward 
              and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could 
              happen, I'd be right back"
jerry, So forget about the books. Did you read them?
george," Well, yeah."
jerry, What do you need them for?
george, I don't know. They're books.
jerry," What is this obsession people have with books? They put 
              them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it 
              for after you read it?"

marlene," Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like 
              to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was."
jerry," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a

              fruit."

elaine, Yep.

              just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no. 
              Do not be afraid of this man."""
jerry, Right.
elaine," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. 
              And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow 
              as if he's really trying to figure it"
jerry," ""You little phony""?"
elaine," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh,

jerry, I thought you'd be upset.
george, I guess I should be but I'm not.
jerry, Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
george," No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's 
              very sexy."
jerry, That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.
george," I know, I know."
jerry," So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?"
george," See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. 
              She's too crazy for me."
jerry," Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking 
              about her."
george," I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better 
              in my whole life."

              back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of 
              your bill."
george,  You paid that crook?!
jerry, I had to.
george," He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you 
              to do that?"
jerry, It was embarrassing to me.
george, I was trying to make a point.
jerry, Why don't you make a point with your own doctor?  What's wrong?

jerry, Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
marlene, ..I saw your act.
jerry, My act? What does that have to do with anything?
marlene," Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's 
              just so much fluff."
jerry," I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't 
              like my act, so that's it?"
marlene, I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.

helen," Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear 
              to an anniversary party?"
jerry," Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. 
              He knows what he's doing."
helen, But it's their 50th anniversary.
morty," You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. 
              They invited you again. I think you should go."
jerry," First of all, I made plans with Elaine."
helen, So bring her.
jerry," I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? 
              I mean, I've met them three times in my life."
morty," I don't know her either.  She makes 
              me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes 
              my jacket."
helen," At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then 
              you'll leave."
morty, How come he gets to leave?
jerry," If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's 
              always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because 
              so many people have left in the"
morty," And it's always about Jeffrey, right?"
jerry," Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid 
              works for the Parks Department."
kramer," Morty, are you coming in?"
morty," Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it."
kramer,"  Hey, how'd you do?"
jerry, We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..
kramer, Yeah!
jerry,  What is this about?
kramer," I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. 
              You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle."
jerry, What are you doing?
kramer, Levels.
jerry, Levels?
kramer," Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And 
              I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll 
              all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You"
jerry, You drew up plans for this?
kramer," No, no. It's all in my head."
morty, I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.
kramer," Oh, I'll be comfortable."
jerry, When do you intend to do this?
kramer, Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.
jerry, You're doing this yourself?
kramer," It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?"
jerry," Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that 
              you can't, and I'm positive that you won't."
kramer," Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is 
              the lumber."
morty," Hey, that's some big job."
jerry, I don't see it happening.
kramer," Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even 
              bet you."
jerry, Seriously?
helen," I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet."
kramer," A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of 
              the month."
jerry, I'll give you a year.
kramer," No, no, no. End of the month."
jerry, It's a bet. 
,
jerry," Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?"
elaine," No, no. I'm fine."
leo," Jerry, are you listening to this?"
jerry," Yeah, Uncle Leo."
leo," So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey 
              for a citation."
jerry, Right. For reducing the pond scum?
leo," No, for the walking tours."
jerry," Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible 
              foliage tour."
leo," That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. 
              For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want 
              to know something? Whenever"
jerry, Mickey Mantle?
elaine,"  Jerry, 
              Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!"
jerry,"  These peas are bursting with country-fresh 
              flavor."
elaine, Mmm.. phenomenal peas..
morty, Are you ready for dessert?
jerry," Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going."
manya,  You're going?
elaine, I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
jerry," Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles 
              swell up, and I can't dance."
manya, Can't dance?
helen," He's kidding, Manya."
manya, Is that a joke?
helen,"  So, did you hear Claire's getting married?"
manya," Yeah, yeah.."
helen," I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, 
              trotters, like at Yonkers."
jerry, Horses. They're like big riding dogs.
elaine," What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? 
              And those kids who had their own ponies.."
jerry," I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that 
              ever had a pony when they were growing up."
manya, ..I had a pony.
jerry," ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se."
manya,"  When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. 
              My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with 
              that?"
jerry, Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..
helen, Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?
manya, He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
jerry," Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't 
              love a person that had a pony?"
manya, You! You said so!
jerry," No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in 
              Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.."
manya, That's it! I've had enough! 
isaac," Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been 
              an emotional day."
jerry," I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had 
              a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you 
              know what the odds are on"
,
jerry, I'll drive you to the airport.
helen," No, we're taking a cab."
jerry," I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper 
              on the trip."
helen, Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.
morty," Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony."
jerry," Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine 
              too. She feels terrible."
helen," You know, you should give Manya a call."
jerry, Maybe I will.
kramer," Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye.  
              ..Need any help with those?"
morty," It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?"
kramer," Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it."
jerry,  Really? What a shock.
helen," Goodbye, Jerry."
jerry, Take care.
helen, We'll call you. 
morty," Bye, Jer."
jerry," Bye, Dad. Take it easy."
morty," Bye, Mr. Kramer."
kramer," Yeah. So long, Morty. "
jerry," So, when do I get my dinner?"
kramer, There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.
jerry, Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.
kramer, There's not bet if I' not doing it.
jerry, That's the bet! That you're not doing it!
kramer," Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it."
jerry," We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would 
              be done."
kramer, And it could be done.
jerry," Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! 
              But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is 
              the levels."
kramer, But I don't want the levels!
jerry," That's the bet!  Hello? ..No, 
              oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe 
              I can still catch them. (Jerry"
,
helen, Who did you talk to?
jerry, Uncle Leo.
helen, And when's the funeral?
jerry, I don't know. He said he'd call back.
morty," You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. 
              Those tickets are non-refundable."
helen, She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..
jerry, What?
helen, What? Nothing.
jerry, You don't think.. What? The pony remark?
helen," Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman."
jerry, You don't think that I killed her?
morty, You know what the flight back'll cost us?
jerry," It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a 
              pony!"
morty," Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base 
              in Sarasota, I think."
jerry," The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. 
               That's probably Uncle Leo."
helen," Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. 
              Sure, sure, we'll see you then.  The funeral's Wednesday."
jerry," Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?"
helen," Two o' clock, Wednesday.  What?"
jerry, I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.
helen, So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.
jerry, I didn't even know the woman.
helen, So don't go.
jerry, I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.
helen," Jery, no one's forcing you."
jerry," I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I 
              want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything."
helen," I don't have a dress to wear.  And you. You don't 
              have anything."
morty, I got a sport jacket.
helen, You're not wearing that to a funeral.
morty, What's wrong with it?
helen, It looks ridiculous.
morty, What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?
jerry, I don't know what to do.
morty," ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? 
              Oh boy!"
,
jerry," We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that 
              we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I 
              think if you can't stretch out and"
,
elaine," I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. 
              What time's your game?"
jerry, Two Forty-Five.
elaine, And what time's the funeral?
jerry, Two o' clock.
elaine, How long does a funeral take?
jerry," Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, 
              even Oswald took forty-five minutes."
elaine, So you cna't do both?
jerry," You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some 
              mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go 
              to my funeral. I would"
elaine, How can you even consider not going?
george," You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances 
              in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's 
              it gonna happen? I"
elaine," You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality 
              and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that."
george," They always make me take stock of my life and how I've 
              pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting 
              it."
jerry," I know, and then you say to yourself, ""From this moment 
              on, I'm not going to waste any more of it."" But then you go, 
              ""How? What can I do that's not"
elaine," Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't 
              you hae coffee with people?"
george," You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. 
              We need you. You're hitting everything."
elaine, He has to go. He may have killed her.
jerry, Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
elaine," Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one."
george,  Who's going to play left field?
jerry, Bender.
george," Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see 
              what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think 
              dead peole care who's at the"
elaine, Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?
george," If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions 
              and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think 
              she's going to want to hang"
elaine," George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other 
              dimensions."
george," You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's 
              not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental."
jerry, Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.
elaine, Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?
jerry," I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War 
              II. The rent's three hundred a month."

              abou tthe other night."
elaine," Oh, me too."
isaac," Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor 
              upset about the potato salad."

isaac," Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked 
              Phoenix."

              your apartment?"
isaac, Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.
elaine," Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what 
              about that big apartment on West End Avenue?"
isaac, Although they say it's a dry heat.
elaine," Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?"
isaac, I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.
elaine," I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, 
              and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure 
              that nothing happens to it."

jerry, I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
george," And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the 
              pop fly?"
jerry, I thought there were two outs.
elaine," I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought 
              maybe they had changed the rules or something."
jerry, It was the single worst moment of my life.
george, What about Sharon Besser?
jerry," Oh, well, of course. 1973."
elaine," Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?"
jerry, Wonder about what?
elaine, You know.. the spirit world.
jerry," You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex 
              on me?"
elaine, I never saw anyone play like that.
jerry, But I went ot the funeral.
elaine," Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her."
george," Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting 
              another galaxy that day."

jerry, Absolutely.
george, ..It's fabulous.
jerry, I know.
george," And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to 
              ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me 
              when you feel comfortable.. So"
kramer," Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?"
jerry," Well, what kind of solid?"
kramer," I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's 
              double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds."
jerry, Birds?
kramer," Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away 
              on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves."
jerry, So take a cab.
kramer, They won't take a cage full of birds.
jerry, I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.
kramer," George, do me a solid? Two minutes."
george," Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done 
              a solid before."
kramer," Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one."
jerry,"  Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. 
              By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand 
              years."
,
george," ""Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never 
              wants a passerby to pass him by."""
jerry,"  Schumann.  
              Where are they?"
george, Maybe he didn't show up.
jerry," What, you don't want to do this?"
george," I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life 
              where I wanted the other guy to show up."
george,"  Wait a 
              second, is that him?"
jerry," Yeah, I think it is.  Where's Elaine?"
george, I'm nervous.
jerry, Excuse me.. Mister Benes?
alton, Yeah?
jerry, I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.
george,"  It's a great thrill 
              to meet you, Sir."
alton, Sit down. Want a drink?
jerry, Sure.
alton,  What do you have?
jerry,  I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.
george," And, I'll have a club soda with no ice."
benes,"  I'll have another Scotch 
              with plenty of ice."
george, You like ice?
alton, Huh?
george," I said, do you like ice?"
alton, Like it?
george, Don't you think you get more without it?
alton,  Where's Elaine?
jerry," Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually 
              pretty punctual.  ..Don't you find that, George?"
george," Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes."
jerry," Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's 
              late."
george, I guess today she's late.
jerry, It appears that way.
george, Yep.
jerry, Yep.
alton, Looks like rain.
george,"  I know, I know, that's what they said."
alton, Who said?
george," The weather guy, Dr. Waldo."
alton, I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.
george," No, of course not. I didn't.."
alton, All I have to do is stick my head out the window.  Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?
george,"  Oh, he's the comedian."
jerry, I'm just a regular person.
george," No, no. He's just being modest."
alton," We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They 
              blew his brains out all over the Pacific.  There's nothing 
              funny about that."
jerry," Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
              I'll be right back."
george," I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. 
              I thought it was just brilliant."
alton, Drivel.
george, Maybe some parts.
alton, What parts?
george," The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have 
              to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. "
george, Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
jerry, That was brutal. I can't go back out there.
george," Well, let's just leave."
jerry, Elaine'll kill me.
george, Where is she?
jerry, She's gotta be here soon.
george," How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more 
              minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy 
              scares me."
jerry, The waiter was trembling.
george," If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with 
              him alone."
jerry, How are we gonna get out of it?
george, We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.
jerry," Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe."
george," I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have 
              the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that."

              the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three."

george," Sure, Guatamala."
alton,"  Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll 
              head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going 
              to the bathroom. "
george," Come on, let's go!"
jerry, What about Elaine?
george, To hell with Elaine!
jerry, She'll be furious.
george, We're dying here!
jerry, That's her! She's here!
elaine, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?
george,  He's in the bathroom.
jerry, Where have you been?!
elaine," Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls 
              me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick 
              up these birds.."
jerry," Oh, you didn't.."
elaine," Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am 
              sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. 
              Then a cop comes by, tells me"
jerry,  Great.
george, Couldn't be better.
elaine, Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
jerry," Oh, no, no."
george, Get outta here..
elaine," Man, Kramer! I could kill him."
jerry," I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved 
              with Kramer."
elaine, He said he'd give me a lift.
jerry," Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what 
              it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?"
george, Where do you come up with this stuff?
alton,"  Well, look who's here."
elaine," Oh, Hi, Dad."
alton,"  Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?"
elaine, No one.
alton, ..How's your mother?
elaine, Fine.
alton, How about you? Are you working?
elaine," Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I 
              told you ten times."
alton," Pendant, those bastards.. Alright, boys. We'll go to that 
              Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little 
              spice, are you?"

              it?"
george, I wouldn't think so.
jerry," What should I do?  We're taking a cab, aren't 
              we?"
alton, Cab? It's only five blocks.
george,  Why don't you just turn it inside out?
jerry, Inside out! Great.
alton, Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?
jerry," Oh, I turned my jacket inside out."
alton," Well, you look like a damn fool!"
jerry,"  Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get 
              ruined."
alton," Well, you're not going to walk down the street with my and

kramer," Hey, where's your new jacket?  What? (Kramer 
              enters the bathroom,"
jerry, I was out in the snow last night.
kramer, Don't youk now what that does to suede?

              at Cinema III."
elaine," Okay..  Hello.  Listen, thanks again 
              for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time."

              he hates everyone."
jerry, Really?
kramer, You gonna throw this out?
jerry," Well, I can't wear it."

              him of somebody he knew in Korea."
kramer," Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could 
              take it."

              to call you "
george," I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you."
carol," Oh, that's so sweet."
george," Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into 
              him "
jerry, All the time.
carol, It's nice to meet you.
jerry, Hi.
carol," So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?"
george," You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give 
              Jerry a "
carol," OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?"
george, Don't you wanna go upstairs first?
carol," No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman."
jerry," You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
carol," Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next 
              door."
george," Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so..."
carol, Well they have a phone.
george," I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. 
              I think we "
carol,"  You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check 
              my "
george," Right, right."
carol, The bathroom's on the hall to the right.
jerry," Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long 
              trip."
carol," No, I'm fine."
jerry," Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away."
carol, Oh that's weird.
george," No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that 
              in medical "
carol," Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go."
george," Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now."
carol, Sure.
george," Please, this is very, very important. "
george,"  Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon 
              tree!"
carol,"  Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've 
              seen "
jerry, Right. I am.
george," Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a 
              moment, if "
jerry,  Hey you two. I'm ready to go.
carol," That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers 
              in the "
george,  Don't you find that strange?
jerry, Yes.
carol," Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing 
              here, "
george," Oh, uhhh..."
carol," Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love 
              jokes "
,
jerry," I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, 
        and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because 
        it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know 
        so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that 
        I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable 
        prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very 
        nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know 
        I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am 
        among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what 
        annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with 
        that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes 
        company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the 
        truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!"" 
        You turn it over, giant printing, ""Not even close!"" You open 
        it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, ""Even we cannot 
        believe how badly you've done in this contest."""
jerry,"  To the right. 
        "
george, That took awhile.
jerry,  Don't get up.
george," I'd like to help, but my neck.."
george, So how long has it been in the basement?
jerry," Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my 
        parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of 
        it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been 
        sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it.  Alright, 
        so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here."
george, What's in it?
jerry, Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.
kramer,"  You want these? Knee socks. You don't 
        wear knee socks."
jerry," No, go ahead.  Look at this place. 
        I can't wait to get it cleaned."
george, I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.
jerry," No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend 
        goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it."
george," Students can't clean. It's anathema.  ..They 
        don't like it."
jerry, How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
kramer," Now this, I like."
george, Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.
kramer,"  Wait, wait, wait.."
george, Let me just see it.
kramer, Come on..
george," Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the 
        same!"
jerry, What?
george," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue 
        on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and 
        I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"", 
        and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,"" 
        and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like 
        I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was 
        the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father 
        naked."
kramer," C'mon, George. I saw it first."
george," No, Kramer. I have to have this statue."
kramer," No, I got dibs!"
george," What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!"
jerry,"  Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't 
        you just settle it like mature adults?"
kramer, Potato man!
george," No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink."
kramer, Okay.. start with me.
george," Yeah, good, good."
jerry," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. 
        Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you 
        kissed the girl behind the magazine..  And you are it! "
kramer," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, 
        oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it."
george," No, no, no, no.. I'm ""it"". I win."
jerry," No, he's it. He wins. ""It"" is good."
kramer, Do over - start with him.
jerry," No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks."
kramer," Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and 
        the shoes, and the hat."
jerry," Alright, c'mon. Let's go."
kramer," Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. "
george,  I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.
jerry," Come on, let's go.  Aren't you gonna take it?"
george," No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick 
        it up later."
goerge,  What about your stuff?
kramer," Oh, uh, well - okay. "
jerry," Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one."
george, What?
jerry," The Inka-dink.. you were ""It""."
george," ""It""'s bad?"
jerry," ""It"" very bad."
rava," Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go 
        to another publisher. It's that simple."
elaine, You told them that?
rava, Of course.
elaine, This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.
jerry,"  So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much 
        longer. I've got a flight."
elaine," Oh, probably caught in traffic."
rava,  Or maybe he's dead.
jerry,"  So what do you write, children's books?"
rava, That's Ray.
ray," Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. 
        My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. 
        And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to 
        serve you. "
jerry,  ..Alright.
rava, And we have to get back to work. 
jerry,  I gotta get to the airport.
ray," Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save 
        arrival, Sire."
jerry, The toilet brush is under the sink.. 
jerry," I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because 
        there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, 
        you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm 
        really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."" 
        And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. 
        I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you 
        couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you 
        couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"""
jerry," He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of 
        the dishwashing liquid.  He cleaned out the bottom 
        of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this.  He 
        cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. 
        How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!"
elaine, There's no Rubber Man.
jerry," ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man 
        and Plastic Man."
elaine, I'm leaving.
jerry, Where are you going?
elaine, To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.
jerry," Wait. I'll go with you.  Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! "
elaine,"  So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! 
        I think because of your request.."
rava," Demand.  There's 
        Ray.. late as usual."
ray," Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and 
        future king of comedy, ""Jerry the First,"" gracing our humble 
        abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty."
jerry," Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that 
        apartment."
ray," But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, 
        a celebration of life."
jerry,"  Shouldn't you be out on a ledge 
        somewhere?"
rava, The water is boiling. Are you having tea?
elaine, Jerry? ..Jerry!
jerry,  What?
rava,"  Ray, would you give me a hand?"
ray," Yeah, I'm coming!"
jerry,"  I think that's the statue from my house. 
        That looks like the statue from my house!"
elaine, What statue?
jerry, I had a statue!
elaine, You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
jerry, My grandfather gave me a statue!
elaine, Since when?
jerry," What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This 
        guy ripped me off!"
ray, Do you take sugar?
jerry, I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!
elaine, Do you realize what you're saying?
jerry," Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of 
        my house!"
ray, Lemon?
elaine, Are you sure?
jerry, Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
elaine, Ninety-nine percent sure?!
ray," Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the 
        soul."
ray, The pastries!
elaine, Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
jerry," Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, 
        he has the same exact statue in his apartment."
elaine, I never saw the statue.
jerry, I had a statue! What should I do?
elaine, I don't know.
jerry, ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. 
elaine," Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me."
jerry," Don't worry..  Kramer! Kramer!.. It's 
        Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry 
        Seinfeld!.. "
jerry," Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right 
        in the pan. Okay, bye.  My mother.. She forgot how to make French 
        Toast. You know how mothers are."
rava," My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He 
        ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere."
jerry," My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot 
        down there in the summer. You ever been down there?"
ray," I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the 
        pastries were the food of the gods."
jerry," ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial."
elaine,"  Oh, see you tomarrow morning."
ray," Oh, how about dinner?"
jerry," No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. "
jerry,"  Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.  Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they 
        can do."
kramer, Let's go get him.
jerry," Yeah, right."
george, We can't just let him get away with this.
jerry," Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? 
        He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things 
        to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy."
kramer, You wanta go get him?
elaine," Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it."
george," Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect 
        the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!"
elaine," George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?"
george, Who is this Rava?
kramer, I say we get him.
elaine, No!
george, Let me just call him.
jerry," I'll call him.  Hello, 
        Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King 
        of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one 
        with the blue lady?  Will you shut up?!  
        Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava 
        to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, 
        Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. "
elaine,"  Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it."
george," Oh, he stole it?"
elaine," C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. 
        What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?"
george,"  I thought you said one o' 
        clock."
jerry," Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his ""M.O."""
george," Remember, don't take any crap."
jerry," Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it."
george, I'll be right here.
jerry,"  That's comforting.. Shh. He's here.  
        Ray?"
ray,"  Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked 
        me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me 
        into?"
jerry," ..Well, I didn't.."
ray," Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got 
        the statue."
george,  I wonder why.
jerry," Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything."
ray, Give it back?
jerry, Yeah.
ray, What are you talking about?
jerry, What are you talking about?
george,  What is he talking about..
ray, I'm talking about the statue.
jerry," Yeah, me too."
ray, Give it back to whom?
jerry, Me.
george,"  Yeah, him."
ray, You?
jerry, Yeah. Me.
ray, I'm not getting this.
george,  You already got it.
jerry," Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then 
        I saw it in your house."
ray, What are you saying?
jerry, What am I saying?
george,  Take a wild guess.
ray, Are you saying I stole your statue?
george,  What a mind.
jerry," Well, I.."
ray, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
jerry, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
george,  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
ray," For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop."
george,  A pawn shop?
jerry, A pawn shop?
ray, Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.
george,  And cleaning them out.
jerry," Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house."
ray," What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?"
george,  Again with the Rava.
ray, You want her.
jerry,"  No, she's a little too cheery for me."
ray,"  She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do 
        you understand?!"
jerry, I know Finland. They're neutral.
ray, Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
jerry," No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times."
george,"  ""Oh, I find you so charming"" ..You wuss."
jerry,  Did you call me a wuss?
ray, What did you say?
jerry, I said luss.. I'm at a luss..
ray, I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
jerry," That's not necessary.  You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea."
ray," And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, 
        the guy retired and moved to Singapore."
george,  Singapore?! Do you hear this?
ray," If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand 
        have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over."
georgge," That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! 
         You stole the statue! You're 
        a theif! You're a liar!"
jerry,  George.
ray,  Who is this?
george," I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!"
ray, What's going on here?
george, GUILTY!
ray, Your friend is crazy.
george," Oh, I'm crazy!"
jerry,"  George, george.."
ray, I've got to get going. I have a class.
george," Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. 
        I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record 
        of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!"
ray," Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond 
        Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name."
george, You mean alias.
ray, You are starting to make me angry.
george," Well, that was bound to happen!"
ray,"  I hope you think about what you've done here today.. 
        and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. "
jerry," Hey, Ray."
ray,  Yes?
jerry," How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? 
        It was like a brand-new nozzle!"
elaine, Nervous?
rava, Why should I be?
elaine, Yeah. Right.
rava, Your notes are very insightful.
elaine, The book is great. Did you go out last night?
rava, No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
elaine, They all are..
rava, Was Jerry?
elaine, I can't remember..
rava," You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations."
elaine," Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. 
        I am not getting involved."
rava,  So you think he stole it?!
elaine," Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence."
rava, I admit nothing!
man," Will you put that cigarette out, please?"
elaine," Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and 
        it's in your apartment."
rava, Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
elaine," No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence."
rava," Yes, that's all, a coincidence!"
elaine, A big coincidence.
rava, Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
elaine," No, that's a big coincidence."
rava," That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and 
        big coincidences!"
elaine," No, there are degrees of coincidences."
rava," No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone!  Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, 
        or just coincidences?  ..Well?! Well?!.."
man, Will you put that cigarette out?!
rava,"  Maybe I put it out on your face! 
         It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our 
        love. You're trying to destroy us."
elaine, Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
george,"  Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is 
        it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, 
        fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye.  She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me."
kramer, I'm not happy about this.
elaine, Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
george," There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's 
        made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."
jerry, Really?
george,  Sure. Why not?
elaine," Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel 
        of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook."
jerry, Can't you talk to your boss?
elaine," I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think 
        you're funny at all."
kramer, I'm not happy about this.
jerry," Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the 
        next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh 
        brand of justice.."
george, Yeah.. He'll have my parents!
kramer, Police! Open up!
ray, Police? 
kramer," Freeze, mother!"
ray, Hey..
kramer," Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em!  You're 
        in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. 
        and uh, uh.. murder."
ray, Murder?!
kramer," Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!"
ray, I think you have me confused with somebody else.
kramer,  Is your name Ray?
ray, Yeah.
kramer,"  Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. "
ray," Hey, hey, are you a cop?"
kramer," Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's 
        your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any 
        more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?"
ray, Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
kramer, Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. 
jerry," Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?"
george," Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!"
kramer, Yeah.
jerry," Kramer, what did you do?"
kramer," Well, let's put it this way I didn't take him to People's Court."
george," I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders.  
        I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!"
kramer," Well, I'll think of something.. "
jerry," People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, 
        everybody has their own little personal security things - things that 
        they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You 
        go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's 
        gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? 
        I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the 
        toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move 
        on."
levitan," Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George.  
              Get"
george," That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm 
              gone."
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
kramer," Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again 
              last"
jerry," Well, what'd you say?"
kramer," I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to 
              do this for years. I"
jerry, What's his problem?
kramer, No job. No women.
jerry, He called the right guy.
kramer," What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him 
              to live"
jerry," All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
kramer, Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
jerry," Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers 
              in tune with"
kramer, How 'bout if I put a few things --
jerry, Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
kramer," Well, you're going over there."
jerry," I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your 
              guys. You"
kramer, Have you ever met my guys?
jerry, No. I can't say as I have.
kramer, Well!
jerry, All right. Put 'em on top.
kramer, Ah!
jerry," Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I 
              get it done"
vic, I'll have to charge you for another machine.
jerry," Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines 
              are"
george, Guess what.
jerry, How did you know I was here?
george, Kramer. Guess what.
jerry, I don't know.
george, I quit my job.
jerry, Get outta here.
george, I couldn't take it anymore.
vic, You can have this on Monday.
jerry, What happened? Levitan?
george," I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, 
              and then I"
jerry, You and your toilets.
george, I snapped! It was the last straw. 
jerry," So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something 
              else"
george, Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. 
jerry, So what are you gonna do?
george, I like sports. I could do something in sports.
jerry, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
george," You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or 
              something."
jerry," Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. "
george," Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe 
              I could"
jerry, Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
george, What about that?
jerry," Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and 
              people that"
george," Well, that's really not fair."
jerry," I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
george, Movies. I like to watch movies. 
jerry, Yeah. Yeah.
george, Do they pay people to watch movies?
jerry, Projectionists.
george, That's true.
jerry, But you gotta know how to work the projector. 
george, Right.
jerry, And it's probably a union thing.
george,"  Those unions.  Okay. Sports,...movies. 
              What about a"
jerry, Talk show host. That's good.
george," I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. 
              Someone"
jerry, Really?
george," Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where 
              do you"
jerry," Well, that's where it gets tricky. "
george," You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna 
              be a talk"
jerry, I wouldn't think so. 
george, It's all politics.
jerry," All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
george, This could have been a huge mistake.
jerry," Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this 
              through."
george,  What should I do?
jerry, Maybe you can just go back.
george, Go back?
jerry, Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
george," You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning 
              like it"
jerry," Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you 
              seriously. "
george, Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
jerry, Never happened.
george, I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
jerry, So what? You're entitled.
george, I'm emotional.
jerry, That's right. You're emotional.
george, Never happened.
jerry, Never happened.
george, How ya doin'?
glenda, What are you doing here?
george, What? I work here.
glenda, I thought you quit.
george, What quit?  Who quit? 
dan," Bill, how was your weekend?"
bill," Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?"
dan, Fine weekend. 
george, Yeah. Good weekend.
dan," Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing.  Lisa 
              was a"

              for Rick"
george, What? 
levitan," Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?"
george, When?
levitan, Friday. 
george," Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? 
              You"
levitan," You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?"
george, Come on. Will you stop it.
levitan, No brains? No ability?
george, Teasing.
levitan, Okay. I want you outta here.

jerry, That's not that?
george, No.
jerry," Well, if that's not that, what is that?"
george, I've got some plans. I got plans.
jerry, What kind of plans?
george, What's the difference?
jerry, You don't wanna tell me?
george, I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
jerry," What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you 
              Peter"
george," You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. 
              He's been"
jerry, What if you destroy him?
george," No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I 
              researched"
jerry," Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal."
george," This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful 
              thing!"
jerry, You've really gone mental.
george, Nah.
jerry," Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm 
              saying"
george, I got a sauce.
jerry, You got a mickey sauce?
george, And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
jerry, Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
george, I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
jerry, She knew that.
george, But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
jerry, What is the point of all this?
george, Revenge. 
jerry," Oh, the best revenge is living well. "
george, There's no chance of that.
jerry, Did you get your laundry?
kramer, Yeah.
jerry, What's with you?
kramer, He jumped.
jerry, What?
kramer, Yeah. Newman jumped. 
jerry, Did he call you last night?
kramer," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
jerry, What did you say?
kramer," I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."""
jerry, Whew. Did he wave?
kramer," No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous 
              saw him from"
jerry," Oh, my god!"

              you doing?"
vic," Hey, you see that sign right there? "
jerry," Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever 
              you want?"

elaine," Oh, yeah. I see him."
george," Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this."
elaine, Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
george, This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
elaine, Yeah. It is kind of cool.
george, First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
elaine," I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing 
              they do"
george, That's exactly what I told Jerry!
elaine, Really?
george, Yes!
george," God, I've never felt so alive! "
jerry, Maybe we should call this off.
kramer," Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete 
              in"
jerry, And what's gonna happen?
kramer," Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the

              seats."
george,"  I can't explain. It's very important that 
              I sit here."

              Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden 
              to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils."

              no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to 
              socialize with tonsil people."

              have a heart attack."
kramer, No? That's good.
george," I have to have my tonsils 
              taken out."
kramer," Oh man.. No.. George, 
              we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya 
              in here."
jerry,  It's routine surgery.
kramer," Oh yeah? My friend, Bob 
              Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine 
              surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a"
george," Well, what should I do, 
              Kramer?"
jerry," Well, for one think, don't 
              listen to him."
kramer," I'll tell you what to 
              do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll 
              fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just"
jerry," Eckman? I thought he was 
              doing time?"
kramer," No, no, he's out. He 
              got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame 
              him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel."
jerry," A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma 
              was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your 
              tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor."
kramer," He's holistic, George. 
              He's holistic."
george," Holistic.. that sounds 
              right."
jerry," George, you need a medical 
              doctor."
george,"  Let me ask 
              you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils 
              and adenoids removed in the hospital?"
jerry," Well, an overnight stay 
              in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand."
george," Uh-huh. And how much 
              does the healer charge?"
kramer," First visit? Thirty-eight 
              bucks."
george," Oh, yeah? Holistic.. 
              that's what I need. That's the answer."
,
george," So, how do you like the 
              way I talked you into comin' down here?"
jerry," Don't flatter yourself, 
              my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling 
              this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though."
george," All I know is I've been 
              going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three 
              years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm"
jerry,  I've never had a really good pickle.
george," Besides, what's it gonna 
              cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?"
tor,"  Would you not 
              put your foot on that please?"
jerry, Sorry.
tor, What month were you born?
george, April.
tor," You should have been born 
              in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait."
george, Really?
tor," Do you use hot water in 
              the shower?"
george, Yes.
tor, Stop using it.
george, ..Okay.
kramer, I'm off hot water.
tor," Kramer tells me that you 
              are interested in an alternative to surgery."
george," Yes, yes I am."
tor,"  
              I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              is a business like any other business. And business needs"
george,"  
              Can I use hot water on my face?"
tor," No. You know, I am not a 
              business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. 
              You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that 
              you remain"
jerry,"  And you're not a doctor, but you play one 
              in real life."
george,"  
              What about shaving?"
tor,"  You're eating 
              too much dairy.  May I? "
george, I guess so.
tor,"  
              You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the 
              lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and

tor," You know, I lived with the 
              Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into 
              the snow."

jerry, I love crampbark.
tor, Cleavers.
jerry," Cleaver, I once had cleaver 
              as a kid. I was able to lift a car."
tor, And some couchgrass.
jerry," Couchgrass and crampbark? 
              You know, I think that's what killed Curly."
kramer," Go ahead, drink it, George."
jerry," Excuse me, Tor. May I 
              ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch 
              with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't

elaine, Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
kramer," Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah."
elaine, You can't! You can't do this now!

              I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. 
              He won't like that."
elaine, Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.

george,  What am I going to say?!
jerry, Yeah.
george," What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate 
              on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that 
              kind of treatment! What,"
jerry, You'll never say that to her face.
george, Watch me.

kramer,"  Yeah, I eat the whole apple. 
              The core, stem, seeds, everything."
elaine,"  Kramer, Kramer, look at him.  
              Look! He's eating all the food!"
kramer," Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences 
              between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, 
              in Russian, the cable guy,"
elaine, Kramer!
kramer,  Uh.. Excuse me..
elaine," What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town 
              for the weekend."
jerry, The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
elaine," I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable 
              in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything."
leslie," Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town."
jerry," Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less 
              travelled for a reason."
elaine,"  George, don't even 
              think about it! Don't even dream about it!"
george,  About what?
tabachnick,"  Kramer, Kramer, Kramer.."

              kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?"
leslie, Vaguely.
george, You took me to one of your shows..
leslie, And?
george," And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated 
              me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents 
              felt I had talent.."
mary, Jerry?!  Remember me?
jerry," I'm sorry, I.."
mary,"  Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We 
              had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows."
jerry,"  Oh, I, I, think I remember.."
mary," Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next 
              day."
jerry," Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your.."
mary," Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought 
              you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into 
              me again! But you were wrong,"
jerry," No, I don't think that.."

              piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and 
              your"
george," Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd 
              be better suited for improvs, or something.."
leslie, Thanks a lot!
elaine, I'm sorry you have to go.
woman, Yeah. I really have to be going.
jerry," Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. 
              I don't want cable."
kramer, Don't be a fool.
tabachnick, You don't want?
jerry," No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your 
              trouble.."
tabachnick,  Four hundred dollars.
jerry,  Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
leslie, I'm going.. obviously.
elaine," Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on 
              here tonight. You know, I had no idea.."
leslie," Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized 
              something. You're just like you were in college."
elaine,"  Oh, thank 
              you.  ""Like 
              you were in college""?"

george,  I'll be right back. 
jerry,"  I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't 
              even want the thing. What are you going to do?!"
,
george," Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control 
              of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?"
elaine," Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. 
              I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop."
jerry," Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who 
              takes that literally?"

              him some"
jerry, In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
elaine," Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go 
              out with a guy"
george, 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
elaine," Well what do you want to give him, change?"
george, It's more than the meal!

elaine," Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."
jerry," The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress 
              in the world"

              on, did you"
jerry, You lost the 20.
elaine," Well, how could he do that?"
george, You didn't make it clear.
elaine, Make it clear?
jerry," What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the 
              money back."
bruce, Your name?
jerry, Seinfeld.
bruce," Yeah, Seinfeld 4!"
jerry," No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?"
bruce," Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your 
              girlfriend?"
jerry," Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really 
              not relevant"
bruce, Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
jerry," Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?"
bruce," Oh. In about five, ten minutes."
george, So?
jerry, There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
elaine, So when are we gonna eat?
jerry," Five, ten minutes."
george, We should have left earlier. I told you.
jerry, I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
elaine," Oh, well I have to eat."
jerry," Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab."

              have big"
jerry, Well what do you suggest?
elaine," I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em 
              down."

              direction,"
elaine, I can't have popcorn for dinner!
bruce, Cartwright?
jerry, So they have hotdogs there.

              call. Let me"
george," Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?"

              trying to like it, like I have to like it."
jerry, Who said you have to like it?
george," Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's 
              all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto."
jerry, I don't like pesto.
george, Where was pesto 10 years ago?

george, A guy?
elaine,"  Yes, a guy."
jerry," He's from a.. Yakima, right?"
elaine, Seattle.
jerry, Everybody's moving to Seattle.
george, It's the pesto of cities. So..?
elaine,  You tell him.
jerry," Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met 
              a gentleman."
elaine, Ed.
jerry," Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."
elaine, ..We shared an interpersonal experience.  Go on.
jerry," So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow 
              returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash 
              off so easily."
elaine, On some people.
george, Oooh.
jerry," So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week."
elaine," It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became 
              a week."
manager, What happened?
george," Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle."
manager, Sorry to the disturbance.
elaine,  I'm never eating here again.

              to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the

              to know I was kidding."
jerry,"  
              I didn't say anything."
george, I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
elaine," Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
george, I didn't know he'd get fired.
jerry,"  
              He'll probably kill his family over this."
george," What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! 
              Did you see him point?!"
jerry,"  A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem 
              to gravitate twards 'em."
george, Was it my fault?
elaine, Was it my fault?
jerry,"  ..Maybe I'll try that 
              pesto."
,
jerry," Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. 
              I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish 
              your resume and undergo a series of"
george,"  Oh, like you really know busboys."
jerry," Oh, like you do."
george," Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
jerry,  Camp.
george, It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
jerry, Elaine?
elaine,  Yeah.
jerry," Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I 
              know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at 
              the comedy clubs."
george, Then why don't you try and get him another job?
jerry," I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could 
              be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people

              an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D.  Now, I did my"
george, How did you get all this?
elaine," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
jerry," No.  So now you're going to his 
              apartment? I really think this is nuts."
george,"  I'd like to apologize. I want to 
              tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble."
jerry," You, you're going now?"
george," Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe 
              get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something."
jerry, Maybe the fat camp.  You're not going?
elaine," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
jerry," I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till 
              after my set?"
george, It'll take to long.
jerry, Take the K-man. A little support..
george,  I don't a..
kramer, Take me where? Where?

george," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't 
              mind - try not to say too much."
kramer, What am I gonna say?
george, I don't know.
kramer," Well, I'm not an idiot."
george, Certainly not.
kramer, Then we're cool.

kramer, Habla espanol?
george,  Oh my God.
antonio, Si.
kramer, Como se dice.. waterbed?
george,"  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm 
              really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll 
              certainly be glad to do that."
kramer, You got anything to drink? Agua?
george," Oy uy uy..  We really should 
              get going."
kramer, Let me get a glass of water. 
george, Hurry up.

antonio,"  La puerta esta abierta. 
               La puerta esta abierta!  
              Who left the door"
,
kramer," ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, 
              she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never 
              know. They got things in"
george,"  Once again, Antonio, I

              wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you."
kramer, Hey.

              you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?..  That's Elaine."
kramer, It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
jerry,"  Kramer says it's up to the cat now.  
              It'll be on your conscience."
kramer, Oh? How do you figure?
jerry,"  How do you figure?  'Cause you're 
              the one who left the door open."
kramer, Why was I in charge of closing the door?
jerry,"  Why was he in charge of closing the door?  'Cause you came in after 
              him!"
kramer, So!
jerry,"  So!  So, 
              the last person in should close the door!"
kramer, Let me talk to him.

              this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?"
jerry," Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car."
elaine," Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem 
              at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy 
              on a plane to Seattle and out of my"
jerry,"  So, did you have a nice week together?"
elaine," I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that 
              ping?"
jerry, There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
elaine," Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and 
              he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful 
              guy, but I hate his guts!"
jerry," So, you two been, uh.."

jerry, What's your airport route?
elaine, I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
jerry, ..What about the Van Wyck?
elaine," I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on 
              to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut."
jerry, Oooh.
elaine," Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting 
              up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?"
jerry, You still using that old alarm clock?
elaien," Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything 
              - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, 
              a hand comes out and slaps you in"

jerry," Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport 
              can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're

              turning them over in the suitcase."
ed, The kitchen.
elaine, The kitchen?!
ed, I've got a bag of cashews in there.
elaine, They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
ed," What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow 
              or the next day."
elaine, No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
ed, I'll never make it.
elaine, Don't say that!
ed," But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only 
              leave me five minutes to get to the plane."
elaine, Shut up and pack!
ed," And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. 
              Then what will I do?"
elaine, You're talking too much!

              "
ed, My shoes. You packed my shoes.
elaine," Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the

              comes off."
jerry, It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.

george," So, much longer?"
elaine," Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can

george," Oh, this is my friend Jerry."
patrice, Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?
jerry," Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came 
              because I, I heard so many nice things "
patrice, George thinks I'm pretentious. 
george," Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone 
              who was"
patrice," You're just trying to take it all back because you're 
              feeling guilty I'm in here."

jerry, Just chatting. Friendly. 
george," All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices. "
patrice, I know what you said. You can't change that.
george," What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go 
              two minutes without saying stupid things."
jerry," It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, 
              when you come to one of these places, "
george," You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even 
              know someone like you. "
patrice, You mean that?
george, Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile. 
jerry," He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important 
              papers in their, uh, pocket book. "
patrice," Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. 
              You know after that day with George I "
jerry, there are no copies.

jerry," Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think 
              I may have tracked down another receipt. "
elaine, I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
jerry, George? 
george," I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time 
              poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, "
kramer," Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?"
elaine," Yeah, I suppose I am. "
kramer," All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab."
jerry, You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.

jerry," I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. 
        I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing 
        suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go 
        down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear 
        one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've 
        got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing 
        suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear 
        if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like 
        floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that 
        you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You 
        bump into somebody you know ""No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for 
        the boat to come back."""

helen,"  They were supposed to be here at 730. 
        Call the airlines again."
morty,"  What happened to the scotch tape? 
        Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here."
helen, Oh I think that's them!
morty, You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
all," Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc."
morty, Welcome to Florida!
elaine, Hi Mr. Seinfeld! 
jerry," Hey, there's the old man! "
morty," So, what took you so long?"
jerry, We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
helen," I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you 
        up."
jerry, What's the difference?
helen, You could have used our car.
jerry, I don't wanna use your car.
helen, What's wrong with our car?
jerry, Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
helen, We don't use it.
morty, What are you talking? We use it.
helen," If you were using it, we wouldn't use it."
jerry, So what would you do? You'd hitch?
helen, How much is a rent-a-car?
jerry, I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
helen, What? You're crazy.
morty, Plus the insurance.
jerry," Oh, I didn't get the insurance."
morty, How could you not get the insurance?
helen, We'll pay for the car.
jerry, You're not paying for it.
helen, Morty. 
jerry, God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
helen," You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all 
        ready?"
jerry, It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
helen," Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could 
        do your comic routines."
jerry,"  Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd."
elaine,"  Ooh, you have a lake?"
jerry, The lake isn't real.
helen, The lake is real.
morty, Are you kidding? They built the lake.
helen, But it's real. It's water.
helen, Where are you going with those?
jerry, I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
helen, Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
elaine, I can't take your bedroom.
helen, I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
elaine, I can't kick you out of your bed.
helen, We don't even sleep.
jerry, Ma.
helen," But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable."
jerry,  What about you?
morty, Why should I be comfortable?
jerry,  What about him?
helen," Don't worry, he's comfortable."
morty, I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
helen, Will you stop?
elaine," Yeah, I'll just stay in here. "
helen,"  Jerry. 
        You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could 
        stay in there together."
jerry, No that's not such a good idea.
helen, Well I tought that...
jerry, Not now. She's right inside.
helen,  What happened?
jerry, I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
helen, What does that mean?
jerry, Well...
morty,  Why are you whispering?
jerry," Shh! Nothing, nothing."
helen, Elaine...
morty,  What about her?
jerry,"  ...but you know, 
        look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just 
        goes to show you. You never know what... huh  you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. 
        It could just take right off at any time.  We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem 
        to be friend when we sleep together."
morty,"  
        Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends."
helen, He's an idealist.
morty, What the hell are you looking for?
jerry, I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
helen, He likes looking.
morty, So look.
helen, But how long can you look?
jerry, I'm going for the record.
helen," You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you 
        came."
jerry," Oh, come on."
helen, This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
morty, Aha!
doris, So they arrived safely.
morty,  You remember Jack and Doris?
jerry, Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.
elaine, Hi. Nice to meet you.
jack," So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?"
elaine, And scuba diving.
helen, Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
jerry, We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
helen, What do you have to go scuba diving for?
jerry, For fun.
helen, For fun?
morty, Jack have some spong cake.
jack," No. thanks, no."
morty, Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
jack," So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy 
        skit tommsorow?"
jerry, I don't think so.
jack," No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night?  
        All right. I owe you 19.45$ ."
morty, What did you have? You had the minute steak?
jack, Yeah.
morty, Did you have a coke or what?
jack, I did NOT have a coke.
morty, Somebody had a coke.
helen, Oh I had a coke.
doris, And I had the scampi.
jack, So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
morty, All right. Make it 20 bucks.
jack," It's 19.45$, Morty. "
morty, 19.45$ ?
jack," See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but 
        that's why he was such a good president."
jerry, What kind of pen is that?
jack, This pen?
jerry, Yeah.
jack," This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this 
        in space."
jerry," Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you 
        get it?"
jack, Oh it was a gift.
jerry," Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        my elbow to make the pen works."
jack, Take the pen.
jerry, Oh no.
jack, Go ahead.
jerry, I couldn't
jack," Come on, take the pen!"
jerry, I can't take it.
jack, Do me a personal favor!
jerry," No, I'm not..."

        you."
elaine," Mmm, nice to meet you."
jerry, Thanks again.
jack, Come on!
doris,  She's adorable. 
helen,  What did you take his pen for?
jerry, What he gave it to me.
helen, You didn't have to take it.
morty, Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
jerry, He offered it to me.
helen, Because you made such a big fuss about it.
jerry, I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
helen," You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? 
        "
jerry," He could have said ""Thank you, I like it too"" and put 
        it back in his pocket."
helen, He loves that pen.
morty, Oh come on!
helen," He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he 
        goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use 
        it."
jerry," If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
helen, He didn't think you'd accpet.
jerry," Well, he was wrong."
helen," I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone 
        in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about 
        it right now. "
jerry, So you want me to return it?
helen, Yes.
morty, He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
jerry, Hey I don't even want the pen now!
morty," Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe 
        me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!"
elaine," Here, let me see it.  Hey, it 
        wrtites upside down."
,
elaine, Come in.
jerry, Are you O.K. in here?
elaine, Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
jerry," It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We 
        leave on Sunday. It's one day, really."
elaine," Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing 
        me."
jerry," Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my 
        feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule."
elaine, I am never gonna fall asleep.
jerry," Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me."
elaine, How can they not put the air conditioning on?
jerry, They're nuts with temperature.
elaine, This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
jerry, How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
elaine," I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating."
jerry," It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers 
        and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. "
,
morty," Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. 
        Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're 
        gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. 
        You understand me?"
jerry, Stay on Biscayne.
helen, You're going underwater?
jerry, Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
helen," What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's 
        so special?"
jerry, What's so special up here?
elaine, Oh!
helen, What's the matter?
elaine, My back.
helen, What happened?
elaine, That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
helen,  I told you to let us sleep in there.
jerry, Then YOU would be hunched over.
elaine, I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
jerry, You can't go?
helen, So stay home.
elaine, You can go.
jerry, Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
helen, Don't go.
jerry, You sure?
morty, Maybe you should see a doctor.
jerry, We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
elaine,  Yes!
helen," No, we'll stay in there."
jerry, Why don't you get a new sofa?
morty, Nobody uses it.
jerry, I'm buying you a new sofa.
helen," Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy."
elaine," Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner 
        on."
helen, You're hot?
elaine, I've lost 6 pounds.
helen, I don't even know how to work it.
morty, I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
evelyn, Is everybody up?
jerry, Hi. How are you?
evelyn, Hello Jerry.
jerry," Evelyn, this is Elaine."
elaine,  Hi Evelyn.
evelyn, Jerry you got thin.
jerry, Too thin?
helen, Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
evelyn, So where's the new pen? 
jerry,  What?
evelyn, The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
helen, How did you know that?
evelyn, Blanche told me.
helen, Blanche?
evelyn, That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
elaine, The astronauts use them.
helen, What did Blanche say?
evelyn, I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
jerry, I never really wanted the pen.
morty, He gave him the pen.
helen, Morty.
evelyn, Why you don't like the pen?
jerry," No, no, I..."
evelyn," Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him."
helen, Is that what she said?
evelyn, Who?
helen, Blanche.
evelyn, What are you talking about?
helen," Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave 
        it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his 
        head.  You're giving him back that pen. "
elaine, Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
morty,  Oh! I forgot all about it.
jerry," All I said was ""I like the pen""."
morty, How the hell do you work this thing?
 ,
helen, Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
elaine," No no, I wanna go."
helen, But your back hurts.
morty, Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
elaine," Oh, oh, O.K.  
        You can turn down the air conditioning if you want."
helen, No. I'm fine.
elaine, You're not too cold?
helen, No.
jerry, Don't be alarmed.
morty, Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
jerry, I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
helen, Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
jerry,  How are you doing?
elaine, Having a good time!
jerry, Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
helen, What happened to your eyes?
jerry, Well I started to go under...
helen, With the instructor?
jerry," Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous 
        pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets."
helen, I told you...
jack," Excuse me.  Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook 
        to go with her shoes.  The shoes have to match 
        the pocketbook.  What's she doing? Yoga?"
elaine, My back hurts.
jack, Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
morty, We got plenty of time.
jack,  What happened to you?
jerry, I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
helen, It's from scuba diving.
jack, What's there to see underwater?
jerry," Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give 
        me the pen, but I don't really need it."
jack, You what?
jerry," I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. "
jack, Well I mean...
jerry, Take it.
jack, All right! 
morty," You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's 
        pen."
jack, Whose pen?
morty, His pen.
jack, This happens to be my pen.
morty, You didn't give it to him.
jack, What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
morty, Where do you come off with this crap?
jack," Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You 
        offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?"
morty, You said you didn't want it!
jack, Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
morty," Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the 
        hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?"
jack," Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch 
        tape!"
morty," Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over 
        for it!"
jack, Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
morty, I don't want it!
jack, I don't want it!
morty," You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch 
        tape, and get the hell out of here!"
jack, Listen do you think I give a damn?
morty," Aah!  The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. 
        Well that'it for them."
jerry," What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's 
        happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is 
        it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?"
helen," I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there 
        tonight. "
jerry, Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
morty," yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee."
jerry, Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
elaine,  Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
,
photographer, Say astronaut.
elaine, Say what?  Say what?
jerry,  You took too many of those pills.
morty, Astronaut?
helen, Say it.
elaine,  Astro...naut!
morty," Good. O.K.  What about last year 
        when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?"
jerry, Oh God. 
jerry,  Uncle Leo.
leo, Hello!
stella, Morty are you nervous?
morty, What nervous?
leo,"  What's with the 
        sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?"
jerry, I've got a black eye.
stella,  Hello.
jerry," Elaine, this is my aunt Stella."
helen,  STELLA! STELLA!
jerry,  Her back hurts.
stella," Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week."
leo, I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
jerry," No, no."
leo," You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three 
        times already."
elaine,  STELLA! STELLA!
leo," Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material 
        for you."
morty, What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
leo," You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the 
        whole bunch of you!  Oh, here's Jack. We should 
        sit down."
stella,"  This better be good. 
        I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this."
helen,"  I hate her like 
        poison."
jack,"  Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, 
        Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. 
        And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld  A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan."
morty,  Slept on the job? 
jack," Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, 
        dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these 
        qualities. "
helen,  He's joking.
jack, His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
morty,  That's what you say.
jack," But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the 
        crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. 
        "
morty,"  Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about 
        that! "
jerry, Dad!
morty,"  He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. 
        Tell them about that!"
jack, He gave it to me!
morty," Come on. That's enough, sit down!"
jack, I'm not sitting down!
jack," Ow! You broke my dental plate!  Doris! He broke my 
        dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. "
helen," Jerry, do your act."
jerry,  I can't. Nobody's even listening.
helen, They're all gonna leave.
jerry,"  Oh God!  huh... Hey! How you folks 
        doing tonight? "
jerry,"  Have you ever noticed how they always 
        give you the peanuts on the planes?"
jerry," Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is 
        a peanut?"
helen,  Do the dog routine.
jerry, All I said was I liked the pen!
elaine,  STELLA!

chiropractor," You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least 
        five days."
elaine, Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
jerry, There must be some mistake.
chiropractor, I'm afraid not.
elaine,  Five days. Here.
helen,  So we have you for five more days!
jerry,"  Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean 
        you just gonna be..."
elaine, Excuse me?
jerry, Nothing.
evelyn, Good morning.
jerry, Hi Evelyn.
evelyn,  Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
helen, I don't think so.
evelyn," Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. 
        He says Jack has no case."
helen, I'll ask him when he gets up.
evelyn," Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the 
        bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out 
        for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to 
        suck up to."
morty," Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could 
        sleep on that thing?"
helen, I was very comfortable.
evelyn," Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out."
helen, It's in the constitution.
morty,  Who are you?
chiropractor, I'm a chiropractor.
morty, What are you kidding me?
elaine,  Five more days?

gavin," Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I<br/>
              was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had<br/>
              just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel<br/>
              without him."
jerry, Is he on the plane now?
gavin," Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't<br/>
              know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than<br/>

jerry, Huh? How you feeling?
gavin, Would you take care of Farfel?
jerry, Farfel?
jerry, The dog? The dog??
gavin, I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
jerry," But, you know, what if, you know?"
gavin," Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you."
jerry," The dog?<br/>
"
jerry," Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid<br/>
              idiot! Shut up!  So what would you do?"
elaine," Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call."
elaine, If only.
jerry," Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house<br/>
              at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of<br/>
              the house since I got back."
elaine," Hey, when you walk him, do ya..."
jerry, Do I what?
elaine, Do you pick it up?
jerry," Yes, I pick it up."
elaine, You pick it up?!?
jerry, Well you have to.
elaine," Oh, boy would I love to see that."
jerry," SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it!  I don't know what to<br/>
              do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?"
elaine," Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is."
jerry," No, I tried. they don't know anything.  You gotta put the syrup in first."
elaine," No, milk."
jerry," I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."
elaine, What is a bender anyhow?
jerry," I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
elaine, I can't believe he hasn't called.
jerry," Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his<br/>
              dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
kramer," Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
jerry, Why?
elaine," We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
kramer," I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
jerry, You're breaking up?
kramer," Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You<br/>
              know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their<br/>
              feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,<br/>
              watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah."
elaine," Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
kramer," Woah, you didn't like her?"
elaine," If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant<br/>
              Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps."
jerry, I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
kramer, How come you never said anything?
jerry," You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after<br/>
              they stop seeing them."
kramer, I tell you.
jerry, You. I'm talking about people.
elaine, Are we still going to the movies tonight?
jerry," No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me."
elaine, Just me and George?
jerry, Sure.
elaine, But we need you.
jerry, What do you need me for?
elaine, Because... Yeah?
george, Prognosis Negative!
elaine," Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. <br/>
              Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just<br/>
              put some newspapers down or something?"
jerry," No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's<br/>
              right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!"
elaine, Just me and George alone?
george," Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha<br/>
              ha!!!"
jerry, I can't go.
george," Can't go, Why not?"
jerry, Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
george, I thought Kramer was watching.
jerry, He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
george," Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
jerry," No, I don't want that smell in the house."
george, You spritz a little Lysol on it.
jerry," No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of<br/>
              strange mutant funk."
george, So we're not going?
jerry, Nah. You two go.
george, Oh. You still wanna go?
elaine, Do you?
george, If you want.
elaine, It's up to you.
jerry, Go ahead.
elaine," Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,<br/>
              you wanna see Ponce de Leon?"
george, Ponce de Leon? Okay.  You sure you don't wanna go?
jerry, I want to but I can't.
elaine," Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean<br/>
              everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can<br/>
              switch apartments for the night."
jerry, No.
george, What about this--
jerry," Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."
elaine," I know, it's not that."
george, It's just we want you to go.
jerry," Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!<br/>
"
george, So how long did you live there?
elaine, About three years.
george, That's pretty long.
elaine, Hmm.
george," It's not that long, really."
elaine," Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same<br/>
              time, then stop. Another silence."
george, And then you came here.
elaine, Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
jerry," Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from<br/>
              me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!<br/>
"
kramer," I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do<br/>
              something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to<br/>
              society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? <br/>
              Couldn't respect myself."
george, I like herbal tea.
george, Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
elaine, Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
george, Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
elaine, Yeah.
george," Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
elaine, Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
george, You don't tell him?
elaine, No.
george, That is so funny!
elaine, I know!
george," Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
kramer," Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,<br/>
              every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do<br/>
              anything!<br/>

jerry," That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on<br/>

              Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.  That's it, Farfel! <br/>
              Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're<br/>
              checking out!<br/>
"
elaine," It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many<br/>
              situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one."
jerry," Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
elaine," The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of<br/>
              you."
jerry," Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on<br/>
              down.  What?"
elaine, Do you have to?
jerry," What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not<br/>
              sure this is a dog."
elaine," You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
jerry, I'm in the book and I have a machine.
elaine," Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them<br/>
              there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them."
jerry, Really? How late are they open?
jerry, What?
elaine, What is it?
kramer, I went back with Ellen.
elaine, Terrific.
jerry," Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
elaine," Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
kramer, Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
jerry," I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
kramer," From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you<br/>
              don't know me."
elaine," Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
jerry, What are you doing?
kramer, I'm getting my pot.
elaine," Kramer, we like her."
jerry, Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
elaine, I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
jerry," I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said<br/>
              anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes.  <br/>
              Yeah?"
george, Prognosis Negative!
jerry," Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
elaine," Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
jerry," It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
elaine," Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the<br/>
              movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight."
jerry," I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
elaine, We'll see it Sunday.
george," Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
elaine," I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
george, What does this mean?
jerry," Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De<br/>
              Leon."
george," What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
jerry," She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go<br/>
              to the bathroom."
george," Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
jerry," I don't know, regular human time?"
george, Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
jerry, Why shouldn't I go here?
elaine," Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure<br/>
              you get your seats and then go to the bathroom."
george, And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
elaine, Yeah.
jerry," Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
george," Hey, go."
elaine, Who's stopping you?
george," What, are you doing me a favor?"
elaine, Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
george, How's it going?
elaine, Good. Good. You?
george, Things are good.
elaine," Boy, he takes such a long time."
george, I know.
elaine, You know what he does in there? He gargles.
george, Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
elaine," Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
george, How come we never hear him?
elaine," Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,<br/>
              watch."
george," Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
elaine, We talked about that already.
george," Oh.<br/>
"
george," I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm<br/>
              out of conversation."
jerry, So what are calling me six times a day?
george," All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,<br/>
              I could always read the sports section."
jerry, I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
george, Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
jerry," It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
george, Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
jerry," Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.<br/>
"
elaine," Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! <br/>
              When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!"
elaine," Shut up. Shut up!  Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my<br/>
              god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your<br/>
              dog tonight or he has humped his last leg."
george," I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but<br/>
              it's this or nothing."
jerry, I don't know what to do.
george," What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
jerry," I know, I know."
george," So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
jerry, It is kind of silly.
george, Of course it is.
jerry," I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
george, Exactly.
jerry, It's not like she's *in* the movie.
george, Right.
jerry," Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I<br/>
              mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these<br/>
              circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies."
george," And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
jerry," How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level<br/>
              of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,<br/>
              let's just go."
george, Good.
jerry, Saving movies.
george, Ridiculous!
jerry, Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.

              you were released on Monday."
gavin," Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center<br/>
              in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians."

gavin," Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit<br/>
              him before the month is out."
jerry, Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
elaine, We made plans.
jerry, Why don't we just rent a movie?
elaine, I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
jerry," No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,<br/>
              there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard."
elaine," Jerry, you promised me we'd go."
jerry," Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost<br/>
              feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it."
elaine," Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it."
jerry, You and George got together?
elaine," Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about."
jerry, Hello.
jerry, What's up?
kramer," Well, you were right."
jerry, About what?
kramer," Ellen. We, uh, broke up again."
jerry, Too bad.
elaine, I thought she was the one.
kramer, I'll bring back the pot.

kramer," Hey, what are you gonna see?"

kramer, It's purple 23. Remember that. 
george," She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women 
        don't like nice. "
jerry," This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant 
        since it opened. Poor guy. "
george," Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, 
        when nice is bad? "
jerry, What's that smell? What are you wearing? 
george, Little cologne. 
jerry, Manly. 
george, Monica wants me to wear it. 
jerry, So why didn't you say no? 
george, I'm too nice. 
jerry," Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send 
        back money. This is horrible. "
george, She wants me to take an IQ test. 
jerry, That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne. 
george," No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's 
        part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig. "
jerry," I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody. "
george," You know, I can't talk to you anymore. "
jerry," All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test. "
george," Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think 
        I'm smart, but I'm not smart. "
jerry, Who thinks you're smart? 
george, I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing. 
jerry, What thing? 
george, You don't listen when people talk to you anymore! 
jerry," Oh, the IQ thing...yeah. "
george," I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores 
        for 15 years. "
jerry, What did you get? 
george, What did I get or what do I say I got? 
jerry, What do you say? 
george, I say fourteen o nine . 
jerry," 1409, that's a good score. "
george, You're telling me. 
jerry, What did you really get? 
george, You are my friend. 
jerry, Of course. 
george," I tell you everything, right? "
jerry, I hope so. 
george," Well, this I take to the grave. "
jerry," He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. 
        That's why no one is going in. "
elaine, Why do you keep watching? 
jerry," I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the 
        toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going 
        to make it, you kind of root it for awhile. "
elaine, And then you flush. 
jerry," Well, it's a spider. "
elaine," You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't 
        see anyone else in there. "
elaine," You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying. 
      "
jerry, Bazooka Joe. 
jerry, The buzzer. 
elaine, It's your house. 
jerry," My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? 
      "
intercom, It's George. 
jerry, Come on up. 
elaine, Casus belli. 
jerry, What's that? 
elaine," It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted 
        to say it out loud. "
jerry," Go in, go in! "
elaine, Have you gone in there? 
jerry," No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners 
        with him. "
george, Hi. 
jerry," You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us 
        both a favor. "
george," I'm wearing some cologne, all right? "
elaine," Sure, fine. "
jerry, Casus belli. 
elaine, Casus belli. 
george, What's that? 
elaine, Since when do you wear cologne? 
george," Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal 
        point of attention? Let me just be, let me live. "
jerry," Hey, how did you do on that IQ test? "
george, I didn't take it yet. 
elaine, What IQ test? 
george, What's casus belli. 
jerry," Oh, it's nothing... "
george, Is it about me? 
jerry," Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't 
        you just be? Why can't you live? "
elaine," It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, 
        what is this test? "
jerry," This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for 
        this course. "
elaine," Oh, that sounds like fun. "
george," Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. "
elaine," You'll do well, you're smart. "
jerry," No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not. 
      "
elaine, What did you get on your SAT's? 
george, It varies. 
jerry," You know, I don't even know my IQ. "
elaine, Mine's 145. 
george, 145! 
jerry, Get out of here! 
elaine, You get out of here! 
jerry, You get out of here! 
george, You should take the test for me. 
jerry," Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember 
        in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became 
        a legend after that. "
george," Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we 
        do that again? "
elaine, What? 
george," You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out 
        the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor. "
elaine, Are you serious? 
george, Why not? 
elaine, Where would I take the test? 
george," I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here 
        or go to the coffee shop. "
elaine," No, that would be too noisy. "
jerry," Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep. "
elaine," Hey, what do you think? "
jerry," Hey, I love a good caper. "
elaine," Yeah, that's what is is, a caper. "
george, You'll do it? 
elaine, What the hey. 
george," Yeaah, beautiful... Sorry... "
jerry," Well, I've been looking forward to it. "
babu," Oh, how did you hear about us? "
jerry," Eh, people, people are talking. "
babu, Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both. 
jerry, Non smoking would be great. 
babu," Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming 
        hot face cloth for your pleasure. "
jerry, Thank you.  
babu," Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans. "
jerry," Well, what do you recommend my good fellow? "
babu," Oh, the turkey. "
jerry," Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment 
        here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many 
        years. "
babu," You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind... "
george, You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. 
monica, But why? 
george, I can't concentrate in front of you. 
monica," Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean 
        anything. "
george," Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring 
        a persons intelligence. "
monica," Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it. "
george," Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse 
        me, I would like to get started please. "
monica, Good luck. 
george, Don't need it. 
elaine," What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 
        minutes. "
george," I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing 
        this. "
elaine," All right, what time do you want me back here. "
george," Eh, twenty to three. "
elaine, Ok. 
george, Thanks again. 
elaine, All right. 
george," And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. 
      "
jerry," Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur 
        I must say. "
babu, It is in deed my pleasure. 
jerry," Oh, please... "
babu," Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today... "
elaine," Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast. "
babu, Tea and toast. 
jerry, Eat something! Babu... 
elaine," Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni. "
babu," Oh, very good choice. Very good. "
jerry," Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. "
elaine, I know. 
kramer, Hey. 
jerry, Hey. 
kramer," Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... "
elaine, Hey. 
kramer," This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. 
        Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket 
        back. "
jerry, So? 
kramer," Well, I'm not giving it back. "
jerry, Why not? 
kramer," Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're 
        attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him? "
kramer," Oh, gees... "
elaine," Yeah, ok... "
kramer," Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of 
        limitations on that? "
jerry, Statute. 
kramer, What? 
jerry, Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. 
kramer," No, statue. "
jerry," Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. "
kramer," Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it 
        statue or statute of limitations? "
elaine, Statute. 
kramer," Oh, I really think you're wrong. "
elaine," Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long 
        of time. "
kramer, What test? 
elaine, An IQ test. 
kramer, Why do you take an IQ test? 
elaine, It's for George. 
kramer, George? 
elaine," Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later? "
kramer, Why are you taking an IQ test for George? 
elaine, Would you please?! 
kramer," What, is it for a job or something? "
elaine, Later! 
kramer, You're positive it's statute? 
elaine," Yes, yes! "
babu," Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth... "
monica, George? 
george, Yeah? 
monica, The door is locked. 
george," Oh, it's locked? "
monica, I need to get something. 
george," Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. "
monica, George! 
george, Wish I could. 
babu," Ladadeeda, laadadeeda.... "
elaine, Babu! If you don't mind? 
elaine, Oh my God! It's all over the test! 
babu," Oh, I'm terribly sorry. "
elaine, Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway. 
babu," Please, forgive me, please... "
jerry," Go ahead, I'll take care of it. "
babu, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends! 
jerry," It's all right, she was cheating anyway. "
babu, You're a very kind man. 
jerry," Babu, you're Pakistani? "
babu," Yes, Pakistani, yes. "
jerry," Babu, may I say something? "
babu," Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen. "
jerry," I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that 
        perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed 
        to franks and beans for example. "
babu, But there are no Pakistani people here. 
jerry," Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant 
        in the whole neighborhood. "
babu," Yes, you see everything, don't you? "
jerry," Well, not everything. I do what I can. "
babu," I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani 
        restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, 
        very special. "
elaine, It was an accident. 
george, What did you go on a picnic? 
elaine, Babu Bhatt did it. 
george, Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? 
monica, Time's up George. 
george, Ok.  Here you go. 
monica, How did you do? 
george, Piece of cake. 
monica, What happened to the test? 
george, What? I spilled some food on it. 
monica, Food? What food? 
george, What are you talking about? 
monica, Where did you get food? 
george, From my pocket. 
monica, What? 
george," I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. "
monica, And coffee? 
george," Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. "
monica, Where did you get the coffee? 
george," Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, 
        from the grocery store. "
monica, How did you get there? 
george, I walked. 
monica," How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave. 
      "
george, I climbed out the window. 
monica, You climbed out the window? 
george, Of course. 
monica, Why didn't you go out the door? 
george," The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here. 
      "
monica," You are a fascinating man, George Costanza. "
jerry," Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not 
        me. "
elaine, You're very special. 
kramer," Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell 
        him you don't know where I am. "
jerry," Of course, I always do. "
kramer," No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 
      "
elaine, Just give it back to him. 
kramer," Oh, he'll have to kill me.  "

george," 85, Jerry! 85 IQ ! "
elaine, 85? 
jerry," Well, well, well... "
elaine, He's coming up? 
jerry," Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should 
        be here in a few seconds. "
elaine," Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous. "
jerry," Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions 
        about hunting and testicles... "
george," Oh, hello professor. "
elaine," George, I cannot believe... "
george, Please... 
elaine, No there has got be a mistake. 
george," You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father 
        gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. "
jerry, But an 85? 
elaine," There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's 
        name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate. "

babu, You wish to eat? 
jerry," Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen 
        and tell your chef I want the works. "
babu, Very good. 
elaine, What are you doing? 
kramer," Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. "
elaine, What's going on?

elaine," Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out 
        of here. "
kramer, I thought you took the test. 
elaine, I had to take it again.

kramer, Never! 
monica," George, open up. "
monica, Well?

george, Yeah.
audrey, You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
george," Oh, I got it."
audrey," You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge 
        dent."
george," Yeah, phew."

george, We did?
audrey," Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?"
george, Hawaii?
audrey," Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this."
audrey, I never heard that.
george, Oh yeah. My friend lived there.

        And"
kramer," Yes, yes I am."
landlord," I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by 
        it."
kramer," Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing."
landlord," Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?"
kramer, My contention?
landlord," Yes, your contention."
kramer," Yes, that's my contention."
elaine, I heard him contend that.
landlord, It's too bad about your father.
elaine," Oh, it was a frame-up."
landlord," A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work"
elaine," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
kramer, She does fine work.
landlord," Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over 
        to"

isabel," Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part 
        of"

elaine, Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
landlord," He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you 
        he's quite"
elaine," My father, really? I had no idea."
landlord," Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular,

kramer, You don't say?
elaine, I found it!
landlord," The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 
        45 from a"
kramer, So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
elaine," Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"""
jerry, So I assume the jig was up.
elaine," Yeah, pretty much."
audrey, Hi.
elaine, Hi!
jerry, Hey.
elaine," So, will I see you later tonight?"
audrey, Not sure.
kramer, Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
cast,
jerry," I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to 
              work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing 
              there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. 
              I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger 
              knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. 
              I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
              like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking 
              for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack 
              away with. Do you have anything like that? "
jerry," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about."
george, Like you do.
jerry," Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft 
              and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?"
george," What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed 
              it together like a coffee table?"
jerry," I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't 
              it?"
george, Why did France give that to us anyway?
jerry, It was a gift.
george, So countries just exchange gifts like that?
jerry, If they like each other. 
george, There's Elaine. 
jerry, See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
george, Really? They work here in the office?
jerry," Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything. 
            "
george," Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing 
              better to talk about."
jerry, You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
george, Really?
jerry, Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
george," ""Off the wagon""?"
jerry, I think it's off the wagon.
george," I think it's ""on the wagon""."
elaine," Jerry, George, what are you doing here?"
jerry, What am I doing here? Ba-boom 
elaine, *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! 
jerry," Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good 
              for you."
elaine, Where did you find it?
jerry, Under the sofa cushion.
elaine, And you stopped by just to give it to me?
jerry, It's your Christmas present.
elaine, I though I'd never find it.
george, Well today's your lucky day.
elaine, No. Today's *your* lucky day.
george, It will be my first one.
elaine, You want to work here?
george, Huh?
elaine," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. 
              Dick, this is Jerry and this is George."
dick, Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
jerry," ""The guy?"""
elaine,  Dick.
george, How can you just get it?
elaine," My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All 
              you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold 
              my drink. "
jerry, Cranberry juice?
elaine, And vodka.
dick, I got the cranberry juice.
dick, So... you're Jerry.
jerry, So... I'm Jerry. 
george," Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff."
boss, How do you read?
george, I like Mike Lubika.
boss, Mike Lubika?
george," He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very 
              insightful..."
boss," No, no, no. I mean authors."
george," Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because 
              I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out. "
boss, Name a couple.
george," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay."
boss, Art Vandelay?
george," He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village. "
boss, What has he written?
george, Venetian Blinds.
dick,"  I've got new for you. I'm funnier 
              than you are."
jerry," Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football. 
            "
elaine, Where's my drink?
jerry," There.  So, how did it go?"
george, I think he was impressed. 
elaine," No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice. "
jerry," Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours."
elaine," Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to 
              hold it."
jerry," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold 
              it."
elaine, One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
george, Told you.
jerry," I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel 
              like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress."
george, Do I really have to buy her something?
jerry," Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy 
              her a gift. How about this?"
george, What is that? Is that cashmere?
jerry, Yeah. She would love cashmere.
george," Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world 
              that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive."
jerry, Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
george," Wow. Excuse me, Miss?"
woman, Yes?
george, How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
woman,"  Oh, here. This is why."
george, What? I don't see anything.
woman, See this red dot?
george, Oh yeah.
jerry, Oh it's damaged. 
george,"  Well it's not really damaged. 
              85 dollars huh?"
woman, There's no exchanges on this.
george, You think she would care about the red dot?
jerry, It's hard to say. 
george, I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
jerry, Well I can see it.
george," Yeah, but you know where it is."
jerry, Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
george, Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
jerry, It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
george," Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview? 
            "
jerry, You want me to take an overview?
george, Please.
jerry," I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away 
              with something. That's my overview."
jerry, Yeah so?
elaine," He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking 
              again."
jerry," Oh boy, can you smell it?"
elaine, No. I can't smell it.
jerry, Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
elaine, You don't always smell someone from a drink.
jerry, Yes you do.
elaine, What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
jerry, Yes you would.
jerry, I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor? 
kramer, Okay.
jerry, Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
kramer, You can smell me without the drink.
elaine," I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but 
              I can't smell it. "
kramer," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?"
jerry," I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. 
              It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner."
kramer, All right.
jerry, I don't smell anything.
elaine, Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
jerry, Yeah.
george,  It's George.
jerry, Come on up.
kramer," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for 
              this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords 
              you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots 
              of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk 
              all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch."
george, Hello everybody.
kramer," Hey.  I'm going to tell 
              you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going 
              to tell you. I think that you are terrific. "
george,  Thank you.
elaine, Hey what's that?
george, It's an early Christmas present.
elaine, Christmas present? For who?
george, For you.
elaine, *gasp*  Get out of here. 
kramer," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. 
              Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose 
              as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, 
              why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n..."
jerry, Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
elaine,"  Oh George, this is beautiful. Is 
              this cashmere?"
george, Of course it's cashmere.
elaine," Oh, I love cashmere. "
george, Well who doesn't.
elaine," My, George this must have cost a fortune."
george," Ahh, money."
elaine," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?"
jerry," I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people 
              happy."
elaine," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever 
              given me."
george," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out 
              already. It's for special occasions this thing."
kramer, What's that red dot on your sweater?
elaine, What?
george, Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
elaine, Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
george," What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here 
              for a second. Do you see anything here?"
jerry,"  Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know."
elaine, What don't you know?
jerry, I don't know.
elaine, Well do you see it or don't you?
jerry, Ahem. Say that again?
elaine, Do you see it or don't you?
jerry, Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
jerry, Now what did you ask me again.
elaine, You're still here. You're a dynamo.
george, I can't believe I get paid for this.
elaine, I'll see you tomorrow.
george, How you doing?
jerry," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are 
              you, how did you do that?"
george," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning 
              woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning 
              women, chambermaids."
jerry," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too."
george, Why is that?
jerry, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
george," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, 
              her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... "
jerry, Convulsing?
george, Convulsing?
jerry," I don't know, I'm trying to help you."
george, Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
jerry, You don't drink.
george," I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to 
              her."
jerry, So you started drinking.
george," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know 
              if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew 
              she was mopping the floor with me."
jerry, So how was it?
george," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
jerry, Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
elaine, Dick was fired.
jerry," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over 
              to the right, and none of this would have happened."
elaine," You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down 
              at all?"
jerry, What are you saying?
elaine, I'm not saying anything.
jerry, You're saying something.
elaine, What could I be saying?
jerry, Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
elaine, If I was saying something I would have said it.
jerry, Well why don't you say it?
elaine, I said it.
jerry, What did you say?
elaine, Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
jerry, Yeah?
george,  It's George.
jerry, Come on up.
elaine," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy 
              that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? 
               Ooookay, you just gave me the answer."
jerry, No I didn't.
elaine," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression."
jerry," I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I 
              have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe."
elaine, How much did he save?
jerry," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question 
               of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could 
              even think of that. That's what you were seeing."
george," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning 
              the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. 
              She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, 
              I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
jerry," Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. 
              She's asking me all kinds of questions."
george, Did you tell her anything?
jerry, No.
george, Do you swear?
jerry, I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
george, Oh you told her didn't you.
jerry, No.
elaine," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot 
              was on it because you could get it at a discount?"
george, What? Did I what?
elaine, You did didn't you.
george," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in 
              the spirit of the season  and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful 
              Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you 
              at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas."
elaine, Well Jerry told me that you did.
george," You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to 
              say anything."
jerry, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
george," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when 
              I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. 
              I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
              distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. 
              I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time.  I mean look, I have no clothes, look 
              at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot."
george, This is for you.
lady," Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared 
              for me."
george," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that 
              you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. 
              What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. "
lady," Okay, okay, can I open it now?"
george," Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like 
              this very much."
lady, Oh! Is that cashmere? 
george, Of course it's cashemere.
lady, A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
george, Just a little something for Christmas.
lady," When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came 
              to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. 
              I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", 
              and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words 
              ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and 
              he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. 
              But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater 
              and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with 
              the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want 
              the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere."
george," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on 
              now, try it on later."
lady," Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful."
george, Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
lady,  What's this?
jerry," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand 
              blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like 
              the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but 
              I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to 
              spend as much time as you can."
dick, The only stench is comming from you.
audience, Oooooh.
jerry," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and 
              gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not 
              my fault you're back on the wagon."
dick, It's off the wagon.
jerry," In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from 
              town to town?"
dick, I don't know.
jerry," On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of 
              those bottles along the way?"
dick, You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
jerry, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
dick, What the hell do you know about wagons?
jerry, I know enough not to get on them.
boss," I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention 
              that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse 
              on the desk in your office. Is that correct?"
george, Who said that?
boss, She did.
george," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you 
              I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said 
              anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of 
              thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of 
              offices and I tell you peope do that all the time."
boss, You're fired.
george, Well you didn't have to say it like that.
boss, I want you out of here by the end of the day.
george," What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability 
              there?"
boss," Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this."
elaine, You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
george, You never had sex in the office before?
elaine, No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
george, Alright so you made out with someone.
elaine, Well that's not sex.
george, Kissing is sex.
elaine, Kissing is not sex.
jerry, George?
george, Jerry.
elaine," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?"
george, No.
jerry, George?
george, Over here.
elaine, What are you doing here?
jerry, I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
elaine, Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
jerry, I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
elaine," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's 
              on purpose."
jerry, Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
dick, Merry Christmas.
elaine, Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
george," Hide, hide under the desk."
elaine," Ow, ow move over."
jerry, Get off of me.
elaine, I've got no room.
dick, Is that cashmere?
george, Of course it's cashmere.
dick,  What's this?
jerry," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into 
              an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either 
              telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And 
              those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think 
              he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's 
              finally off the wagon."
dick, You mean on the wagon.
jerry," Don't get smart.

kramer, Is Elaine going?
jerry, Yeah
kramer," Well, I knew him as well as she did."
jerry," Yeah, but John invited her."
kramer," So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"

              you might be interfering while we're intervening. "
george, It's George
jerry, Stop smelling your arm.
kramer," You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You 
              spray it on and you smell like you just "
jerry," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe 
              I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
kramer, Tell me about it!
jerry," Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing 
              department at Calvin Klein. "

george," Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted 
              to go out to dinner and she said "
jerry, What's wrong with lunch?
george," Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. 
              you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. "
kramer, I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?

              no hand."
kramer, Break up with her 
george, What?
kramer, You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
jerry, A preemptive breakup. 
george," A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got 
              nothing to lose. "
george," So, I am have to going to break up with you."

kramer," Oh, I'm talking about the beach."
steve, What about it?
kramer," You know the way you smell when you first come home from 
              the beach?"
steve, That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
kramer," Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
steve," Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell 
              like dead"
kramer, So you don't think it's a good idea? 
guy," The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since 
              I was a"
elaine,"  Uh, you have to work like that? "
guy, Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
jerry, In the freezer.
jerry, Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
guy, Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
steve, What's the plan?
jerry, Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
guy," No, we all have to talk."
elaine, What's the order?
guy, We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
roberta, Why am I first? 
elaine, Albano is your last name.
roberta, That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
steve, I'll go first.
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
kramer, Is this the interference?
jerry, Intervention.
kramer," Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?"
steve," Hey, this is for close friends only."
kramer," I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade 
            "
kramer," Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for 
              me, big mouth."
steve, Somebody's going to make that crap?
kramer," Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies."

              him."

roberta, What should we do?
elaine, Hide!
jerry, It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah 
george, It's George
jerry," Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him."
guy, If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
elaine," Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
guy, Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
elaine, You're getting warm.
george, We just came from Chadway's What's going on.
jerry, We're having the intervention for Richie.
george," Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?"
jerry," Well, uh.."
noel,"  Elaine, hi."
elaine," Oh, hi Noel"
jerry," Well, you're looking well."
george," Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand 
              is not a man."" "
steve," Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put 
              that stuff on."
george,  This man is a genius. Genius!
steve, You think so?
george," I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to 
              talk to you"
elaine, 
elaine, 
noel, That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.
elaine," No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. 
              It was Jerry."
noel, You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.
jerry, I didn't know she would laugh.
noel," You lied to me George, you lied to me."
george," No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you 
              going?"
noel, I ... am breaking up ... with you! 
george, You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
noel, And you're going to need it.
jerry, Hey Richie
richie, So what's going on?
jerry," It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, 
              He's hostile, he's"
george, I can't do these puzzles. 
jerry," So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the 
              coffee table "
george, Ah ah Pez dispenser.
jerry," He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized 
              by it. Then he's"
george, Well they're hard to load.
jerry," Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying 
              to load it he loses control"
george, Poor kid.
jerry, So as he's telling the story he starts crying. 
george, What did you do?
jerry, What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
george, Wow
jerry," Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked 
              to the doctor yesterday."
george, What's a three letter word for candy?
jerry, I can't do those things.

        Monologue<br/>
        The thing I dont understand about the suicide person is the people 
        who try and commit suicide for some reason they dont die and thats 
        it. They stop trying. Why? Why dont they just keep trying? What 
        has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact its worse 
        because now theyve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, 
        thats why these people dont succeed in life to begin with. 
        Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills dont work, try a rope. 
        Car wont start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? 
        Theres nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set 
        for yourself. "
jerry," Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you 
        think that would have a negative effect on his life?"
elaine, Na.
jerry, What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
elaine," Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three 
        days?"
jerry, Yeah.
george, Its George.
jerry," Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast 
        for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?"
elaine," I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could 
        have given me ulcers?"
jerry, I think Ill take out the garbage.
elaine," Hey, have you ever fasted?"
jerry," Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, 
        that was pretty rough.  
        Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me."
george," Yeah, right."
jerry," Come on, its just down the hall."
george, Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
jerry, Ill give you 50 cents.
george, Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
jerry," Come on. Fifty cents. &lt;??&gt; a piece of Drakes coffee 
        cake"
george," Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty 
        cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to 
        the Cayman Islands this Friday."
jerry," I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What 
        do you need a break from getting up at eleven?"
george," Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont 
        come with me."
jerry," Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant 
        commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline."
gina, Hi.
jerry, Hi.
gina, How are you?
jerry," Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?"
gina," Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top."
jerry, How much do they cost?
gina, The junior?
george," No, no the full size."
jerry," No, no the junior."
george," You didnt say ""junior""."
gina, I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
jerry," Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! 
         How ya doing?"
martin, Good enough.
jerry, Boy shes sexy isnt she?
jerry, Do you believe that guy?
elaine, What guy?
jerry, My neighbour
elaine," Oh, that creepy guy?"
jerry," Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?"
george, He didnt seem too pleased.
elaine, Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
george," hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream 
        about that guy last night. This is amazing. "
jerry, Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
george, I havent seen him for months.
jerry, What was the dream?
george," I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night 
        club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics 
        off."
jerry, I think Ive played there.
george, Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
jerry, Youre a little paranormal 
elaine," Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic."
george, Really?
elaine," Uh uh, you should go some time. "
george, Id love to go. Make an appointment.
jerry," Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job? "
george, I just got fired.
jerry," Alright, come on, lets get out of here."
elaine, I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
jerry, I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits. 
elaine, Really?
jerry," Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits. "
jerry, Who is it? Who is it?
gina, Its Gina.
jerry, Who?
gina, Martines girl friend. 
jerry, Martine?
gina, You next door neighbour.
jerry," Oh, Martin!"
george," Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill 
        himself with pills."
jerry, What? 
gina, Come on.
jerry, In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
gina, We dont have enough time. 
jerry, Itll take two seconds.
gina, There is no time.
jerry, We dont have two seconds?
gina, All right. Go ahead.
jerry," Nah, forget it."
gina," No, go ahead."
jerry, Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
gina, Will you just get it.
jerry, Are you sure?
gina, Forget it. Come on.
jerry," Nah, Ill go get the robe. "
jerry," Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow 
        comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime. "
gina," You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did 
        not want to see him anymore."
jerry, Really? Its over?
gina," I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a 
        mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. 
        And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy. 
      "
jerry," Oh boy, did he say anything about me?"
gina," He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like 
        Drakes Coffee Cake."
jerry, He said that?
gina," He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and 
        it falls apart when you eat it. "
jerry," Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly. 
      "
gina, I wasnt.
jerry, You werent?
gina," No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about 
        me?"
jerry, Of course.
gina, Tell me everything.
jerry," Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN."
gina," I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could 
        pull the plug out from him. "
jerry," I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries 
        today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this."
gina, I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead. 
jerry," No, I just wanted to see what time it was. "
gina, Are you afraid of him? 
jerry, No.
gina, Then kiss me.
jerry, Here?
gina," Yes, right here."
jerry, Is this the proper venue?
gina, You dont want to?
jerry," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, 
        I pine to. "
gina, Then kiss me right in front of him.
jerry, I cant. What if he wakes up?
gina," A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? 
        What kind of a man are you? "
jerry," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and 
        out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  
        you dont want to mess with it."
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey. 
kramer, Did you hear about Martin?
jerry," Yeah, I heard."
kramer, I cant believe hes in a coma.
kramer," Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. 
        He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? "
jerry, Who told you about Martin?
kramer, Newman! Hes good friends with him. 
kramer," Hes got all of my attachments, you know. "
jerry," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for 
        a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?"
kramer," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? "
jerry," You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres 
        no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their 
        lips around a revolver like a normal person? "
kramer, So whats going on between you and Gina?
jerry," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night."
kramer," Uh, uh."
jerry," So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss 
        her right in front of him. "
kramer," Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean 
        women. All right, so what did you do?"
jerry, Nothing.
kramer," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma 
        and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? "
jerry, I didnt know what the coma etiquette was. 
kramer," There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of 
        the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it. "
jerry," So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its 
        all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim."
kramer," Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant 
        get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush."
jerry," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, 
        he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?"
kramer," NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum 
        cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it. "
rula, Martins spirit came to you as a warning.
elaine, Why would he come to George?
rula," Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET 
        YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE."
george, I knew it. I always felt different. 
rula, You are. Some coffee cake? 
george, Drakes? 
rula, Yes.
george, Did you buy this for me?
rula," No, why?"
george," Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake."
rula, Maybe I did.
elaine, Take it away.
george, She hasnt eaten in two days.
rula, Whos Pauline?
george," Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated 
        a woman named Pauline."
rula, Do you think about her?
george, When I hear her name mentioned.
rula, Cut these with your left hand.
george," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose."
rula," I see an Audrey, but with a small nose."
george," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she 
        ever speak to me again?"
rula, Not in this life. 
elaine, Should you be smoking?
rula, Does it bother you?
elaine, Youre pregnant.
george, Elaine.
rula, I smoked when I had Faisy. 
rula, Ah oh.
george, Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
rula, I dont know about this trip George.
george," You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to 
        happen to me? What?"
elaine, Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
george," Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going 
        to be. "
george, Should I not go on this trip?
rula," George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really 
        hear me."
elaine," Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything 
        we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. "
george," Elaine, what are you doing?"
elaine, Its disgusting.
rula, I DONT BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave. 
elaine," Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so 
        irresponsible."
rula, Get the hell out.
rula, Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
george," If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane 
        crash."
rula, Get out.
george, Not a plane crash.  Is it a plane crash?
gina, I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles. 
jerry," You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if 
        Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. "
gina," It is too small for someone with such a big mouth . 
        Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a 
        mouse?"
jerry," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie."
gina, Who are these Stooges you speak of?
jerry, Theyre a comedy team.
gina, Tell me about them. Everything.
jerry," Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit 
        each other a lot."
gina, You will show me The Stooges?
jerry, I will show you The Stooges.
gina, When?
jerry," Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now 
        but if I locate them you will be the first to know."
gina," Come, you walk me to a cab."
jerry," Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything 
        but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea 
        for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had 
        a lot of friends here."
gina, Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
jerry," Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my 
        closet?"
gina, Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
jerry," Yeah, all right. All right."
kramer, You should just eat fruit. 
newman, I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
kramer, ???
newman, Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
jerry, Hello Newman.
jerry," Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind 
        of sicko would do that? He could kill me."
george," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me."
elaine,  Did you see that wall move?
jerry," Boy, its a good thing we came."
george," Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres 
        native unrest."
elaine," Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much 
        longer it would be until I get my X-ray."
nurse, Well call you.
jerry," George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in 
        a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and 
        put it in storage. "
george, How come?
jerry, Looters.
elaine, How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it? 
jerry, Shes really hungry.
kramer, Hey.
elaine, Kramer
kramer," Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin. "
george, Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
kramer, Youre not going?
george, No.
kramer, Why not?
george, The psychic said something terrible will happen.
kramer, I dig. 
kramer," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, 
        shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going 
        to kill me."
w," He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another 
        one. "
kramer," Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this 
        one?"
w, I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
kramer," I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything. 
      "
w, It gets my rug clean. 
kramer," The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American 
        public since One Hour Martinizing."
w," Well, you should take a look at my rug then."
kramer, I wouldnt set foot in your house.
jerry, Hello.
newman, Hello Jerry.
jerry, Hows he doing? 
kramer, He looks happy to me.
newman, I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
jerry, Why wouldnt he?
newman, No reason.
jerry," Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. "
newman, Ill bring him up to date.
jerry, How up to date?
newman," Oh, all the way up."
jerry, And nothing could change your mind? 
newman," Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something 
        you earn."
kramer," Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands 
        for this weekend. Hes not going. "
newman," I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that 
        a,.."
jerry, Drakes Coffee Cake 
newman," Wow, where did you get that?"
jerry, From my house. I got a whole box of them. 
newman," Boy, thats the full size."
jerry, Thats your big boy.
newman, Can I have a bite?
jerry," I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving 
        it for later. "
newman, Just one bite?
jerry," I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile. 
      "
newman, All right! All right. I wont say anything. 
jerry, You swear?
newman, I swear.
jerry, On your mothers life?
newman, On my mothers life.
kramer, oh oh oh oh oh
newman," Oooh, "
elaine," And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, 
        but juicy tender breasts of duck. "
george," sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart"
rula," pew, pew, pew, pew "
george," how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is 
        phenomenal. "
rula," The nurse said she would be right back. Theyre supposed to 
        take me into the delivery room. "
george," Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to 
        apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even 
        know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt 
        get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .."
rula," Oh, wheres the nurse"
george," I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont 
        you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember 
        the other day you were saying something about my trip. "
rula, Dont take that trip.
george," Yeah, why? Why? "
rula," &lt;screams&gt; EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit."
dx," All right, Rula, its time to go."
george, Because? Because?
elaine," Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  
        Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that."
newman," Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell."
jerry, Elaine! No! No!
martin," Ooooh, ahhhh, "
george," Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? 
        Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?"
newman," He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you."
kramer, I want my vacuum cleaner!
jerry, Hey!
newman, It was disgusting.
jerry, What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
george," I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting. 
      "
jerry, What did she name the kid?
george, You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
kramer, Heey!
george, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
george, when did you get back?
kramer, A couple of hours ago.
george, So how was it?
kramer," George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days 
        I ever spent in my life."
jerry, osh.
kramer," They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right 
        in the hotel pool."

        you<br/>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop<br/>
        it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? 
        I'm<br/>
        *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!<br/>

<br/>
        George I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry He can't hear us.<br/>
<br/>
        George Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick 
        up<br/>
        your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.<br/>

        my<br/>
        house?<br/>
<br/>
        George We'll ask him.  My dear fellow, where are you<br/>

        George Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!<br/>
<br/>
        George You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, 
        wait,<br/>
        you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do

<br/>
        Jerry Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.<br/>
<br/>
        George If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and 
        I<br/>
        have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square

        I<br/>
        can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye.  'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer I know.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry and George He knows?<br/>
<br/>
        George Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Maybe it's a shortcut.<br/>
<br/>
        George We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry  'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this 
        exit?<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer Pick up the other members of your party.<br/>
<br/>
        George Right. The other members of our party.  Other<br/>
        members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know 
        we<br/>
        were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this 
        jig.<br/>
<br/>
        George It was a good jig.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do 
        now? <br/>
        They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        George There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a 
        limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well you should have been O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        George Yes, you have to be Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George You're Murphy!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I'm Seinfeld!<br/>
<br/>
        George You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry We're doing sixty miles an hour!<br/>
<br/>
        George So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Who are you, Mannix?<br/>
<br/>
        George We're slowing down. Are those the people?<br/>

<br/>
        Eva  Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather<br/>

<br/>
        Tim And of course, his great book, ""The Game"".<br/>

<br/>
        Kramer I'll tell you how much I make.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, 
        I<br/>
        don't even like basketball.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer You ever seen Michael Jordan?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Just in those commercials.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.<br/>

        Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry  I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You think someone's been tipped off?<br/>
<br/>
        George So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva  Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.<br/>
<br/>
        George Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman<br/>
        thinks of ""The Big Game"".<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The 
        way you<br/>
        analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left 
        me<br/>
        breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the<br/>
        epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry He tends to exaggerate.<br/>
<br/>
        George Okay, I mean it's serious but--<br/>
<br/>
        Eva We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.<br/>
<br/>
        George Uh, my speech?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it 
        over?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Well you might as well look it over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer So what's going on, how did all this happen?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're 
        all going<br/>
        to the Knicks-Bulls game.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine He did.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call 
        them<br/>
        O'Brien and Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.<br/>
<br/>
        George ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied<br/>
        government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white<br/>
        minority communities.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry You're not going to open with that, are you?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?<br/>
<br/>
        George I said so many things.<br/>
<br/>
        Suddenly they hear a loud bang.<br/>
<br/>
        George They're shooting! They're shooting!<br/>
<br/>
        Tim  Alright, get down!<br/>
<br/>
        The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, 
        Eva has<br/>
        fallen on top of George.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.<br/>
<br/>
        George That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim returns.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, 
        we're<br/>
        prepared to handle anything that might come up.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling<br/>
        it sensually.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Nice looking Lugar.<br/>

<br/>
        New scene.<br/>
        Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square 
        Garden<br/>
        where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering 
        to<br/>
        protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader 
        of the<br/>
        midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their 
        most<br/>
        charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the 
        violent<br/>
        overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration 
        of Adolf<br/>
        Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There 
        is a<br/>
        full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell 
        me he is<br/>
        in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, 
        but<br/>
        quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional<br/>
        fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm 
        Jodi<br/>
        Baskerville, back to you in the studio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up 
        Jerry. <br/>
        They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and 
        wanna be<br/>
        called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
        A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized<br/>
        Elaine.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Elaine?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Good.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, Kramer?<br/>
<br/>
        They shake hands.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head 
        of<br/>
        the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first 
        time<br/>
        he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Who?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo.<br/>
        Jerry and George are alone inside.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What's taking him so long out there?<br/>
<br/>
        George Didja see the way she was looking at me?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!<br/>
<br/>
        George I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna 
        do?<br/>
<br/>
        George I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Let's just make a run for it.<br/>
<br/>
        George I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry How'd that happen?<br/>

        George I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers 
        in real<br/>
        tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick 
        it out<br/>
        and I pulled it.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with 
        your<br/>
        feet like that.<br/>
<br/>
        George For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the 
        police.<br/>
<br/>
        George grabs the phone and dials.<br/>
<br/>
        George 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah<br/>
        listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--<br/>
<br/>
        Tim re-enters the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        George --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! 
        The<br/>
        Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim We'll be ready in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
        George Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the 
        middle<br/>
        of something.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.<br/>
<br/>
        George Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You are.<br/>
<br/>
        George And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular<br/>
        again?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You are.<br/>
<br/>
        George Good. I think you forgot something.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
        George Good. Now get out.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim leaves.<br/>
<br/>
        George Okay, what are we gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        George Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, 
        we see<br/>
        Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I'm sure he was just joking around.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,<br/>
        Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. 
        Yes!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What is it?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about 
        Jerry,<br/>
        always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The 
        limo? <br/>
        The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same<br/>
        person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Jerry's a nazi?!<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer I can't believe I didn't see it.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer You don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine No, he's just neat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        George Me??<br/>
<br/>
        George and Jerry laugh nervously.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim And you really don't look like a Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Where are you from?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. 
        <br/>
        Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country<br/>
        though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Sounds more like Scottish.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry We were right on the border.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the street corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Maybe he's with the company.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization<br/>
        from within.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What about his comedy act?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, 
        he's<br/>
        too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What about George?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. 
        <br/>
        No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're 
        with<br/>
        the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and 
        Hunt<br/>
        and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who 
        killed<br/>
        Kennedy!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I'll bet they were even in on it.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. 
         I'm not gonna.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Kramer, you're hurting me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Quick cut to the now approaching limo.<br/>
<br/>
        George Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk 
        to<br/>
        them, pull over.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Get off of me!!<br/>
<br/>
        The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby 
        bus<br/>
        stop.<br/>
<br/>
        Man O'Brien? Is that him?<br/>
<br/>
        Man #2 Yeah, that's him.<br/>
<br/>
        Man #3 Look there's O'Brien!<br/>
<br/>
        Man #4 Filthy nazi bastard!<br/>
<br/>
        All four Let's get him!!<br/>
<br/>
        They begin running full speed towards the gang.<br/>
<br/>
        George What do I do?! What do I do?!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Get in the car! Get in the car!<br/>
<br/>
        George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer  O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine It could be very confusing.<br/>
<br/>
        The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Yeah? Eva?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva It's for me.  Hello?  It's O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- BeginAd04 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Kramer O'Brien? Well that's weird.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva  Who are you?<br/>
<br/>
        George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car 
        broke<br/>
        down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group 
        of<br/>
        protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of 
        the three<br/>
        are intelligible at this point.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police 
        seem<br/>
        unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien 
        must be<br/>
        having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first 
        public<br/>
        appearance.<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less<br/>
        understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming<br/>
        unnerved.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Get out!!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Elaine?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD<br/>
        O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.<br/>
<br/>
        George I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! 
        <br/>
        Jerry?! Jerry?!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Closing monologue.<br/>
<br/>
        So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie 
        and<br/>
        there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies 
        always<br/>
        had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they 
        would do<br/>
        and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil,<br/>
        remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how 
        are ya,<br/>
        is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the 
        copier? <br/>
        Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, 
        nice<br/>
        to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?<br/>
<br/>

kramer," Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown.  
              Or, really,"

              Todd."

nina," Oh, are you interested?"
george,"  Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested."
kramer," George, you gonna buy a painting?"
george,"  Yeah, sure."
nina, Are you an art-lover?

jerry, May I? 
nina,"  Get outta here!  Here, play with this. (hands"

nina," Well, I really love that piece."
george," Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, 
              in fact, "
nina," No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have 
              it!"
george," This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with 
              me! It should"
nina," Honestly, George, the money's not important."
george, Who said anything about money? 
jerry, Yeah?
elaine,  It's Elaine.
jerry, Come on up.
nina, Elaine?
jerry, ...Yeah.
nina,"  This person does not believe in telephones, 
              does she?"
jerry," She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. 
              (pointing"
george, I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
jerry, Yeah.
george, How 'bout Kramer.
jerry, HUGE pop-in guy!
nina," Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?"
jerry, Yeah.
nina, Okay.
jerry, Okay!
nina, Bye. 
elaine,  Hello!
elaine,"  Chatty gal.  Lippman's coming back tomorrow, 
              I'll"
jerry," If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!"
elaine," No, he wants to torture me. "
elaine,"  Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when 
              you're the"
jerry,  I'm a great clicker! 
elaine," You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! 
              I've never"
jerry, Let go!
elaine," No, come on! I want it, Jerry!"
jerry," Let go, Elaine!"
elaine, Well at least let George do it!
jerry," Oh, George can't click! "
george,"  Give it! Give it! 
              (he finally"
jerry," Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch 
              it a little"
elaine," It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon."
jerry,"  Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches 
              the TV"
elaine, What letter?
jerry," This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from 
              the movie!"
jerry," ""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort 
              to offer happiness"
george, This is incredible!
jerry," I always thought there was something funny about this letter! 
              She cop-"
george, Maybe I won't send her that check.
elaine," You know, it's not really that terrible. "
jerry," What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented 
              herself!"
lippman,"...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap 
              off? "
elaine," Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore."
lippman,"Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?"
elaine," Well, uh, fan. My father--"
lippman,"Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole 
              big scene!"
elaine, Really?
lippman,Yeah.
elaine, So... impudent.
lippman,"Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. 
              I'm inviting"
elaine,"  Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--"
lippman,"Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the 
              game."
elaine,  Okay.
lippman,"Good.  Oh--and Elaine. You know 
              the Baltimore"
elaine, That will be fun.
jerry, How's it coming?
nina," Good, good."
jerry, Seen any good movies lately?
nina, No... not really. You?
jerry," No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You 
              like Neil"
nina," Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff."
jerry," I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to 
              be, uh..."
nina, I don't know... maybe.
jerry," I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other 
              night."
george," Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? 
              "
jerry," Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!"
george, So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
jerry," Yeah.  And by the 
              way, can"
george," Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it 
              to you right"
tvvoice,"Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just 
              behind the"
george," Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other 
              day."
tvvoice,"Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage 
              that kind"
kramer," ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and 
              hopped a "
mrs.arm,More potatoes?
kramer," Yeah, sure. Please."
kramer," Yeah.  And, it was a big one."
jerry," Kramer, what are you doing here!?"
kramer," Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to 
        wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" 
        and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare 
        keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper."
jerry, You scared me!
kramer, It's just me.
jerry, That's enough!
kramer," Forgot the popper... &lt;goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, 
        drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.&gt;"
jerry, Kramer! What are you doing?!
kramer, What does it look like I'm doing? What?
jerry," Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!"
kramer," Alright, alright..."
jerry, C'mon!
kramer, Sorry. 
jerry, Move it! Move it! Get going!
kramer," My drain's all clogged up! &lt;Comes out of the bathroom in a 
        towel, covered in soap suds.&gt;"
girlfriend, I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
jerry," Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, 
        and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your 
        apartment?"
girlfriend," I'm from Witchita, so..."
jerry," Oh. I see. There he is! &lt;Pretends the murderers are coming.&gt; 
      "
girlfriend," Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!"
jerry, The murderers! &lt;Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.&gt;
girlfriend, That was close!
jerry, Did you see the look on that guy's face?
girlfriend," You were <i>so</i> fast with those keys. &lt;They prepare 
        to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of 
        Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.&gt;"
jerry, Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
kramer," Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies."
jerry," All right, that's it. Hand 'em over. "
kramer, What?
jerry," What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your 
        key privileges. "
kramer," Oh, come on!"
jerry," No, come on!"
kramer," What, what, I thought you went to the movies!"
jerry, It was sold out!
kramer, Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
jerry, <i>That's</i> the point.
kramer, What point?
jerry," Just, look, just give the keys."
kramer, Just give me another chance!
jerry, Don't ask me!
kramer, I'm asking you!
jerry, I'm telling you.
kramer, You're joking.
jerry, I'm serious!
kramer, It's not going to happen again!
jerry," Yes it will, now give me those keys!"
jerry, So put 'em in a safe place.
elaine, I will. 
jerry, Where?
elaine," I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?"
jerry," I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different."
elaine," Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back."
jerry, I can't.
jerry, Who's there?
elaine," Oh, I'm not, uh..."
kramer," No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. 
        I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of 
        the keys."""
elaine," Jerry, give him the keys back."
jerry, Elaine...
kramer," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned 
        out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of 
        a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. 
        To float.  And I thank you."
jerry, Take the keys.
kramer," I don't want the keys! &lt;Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, 
        but Kramer refuses.&gt; "
jerry, O.K.!
kramer," Now, one more thing - I would like <i>my</i> keys back."
jerry, Your spare set?
kramer, That's right.
jerry, You want 'em back?
kramer," Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best."
george," Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say."
kramer," Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!"
george," Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? 
        Because Elaine has my keys. "
kramer," Well, you can get 'em back."
george, I suppose I could.
kramer," Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? 
        That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, 
        it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And 
        cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor 
        in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. 
        I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the 
        darkness...like you."
george, Me?
kramer," Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George."
george," Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. &lt;The waitress 
        comes over.&gt;"
waitress," Hi, are you ready to order? &lt;George tries to order, but 
        Kramer interrupts.&gt;"
george, Yearn? Do I yearn?
kramer, I yearn. 
george, You yearn. 
kramer," Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you 
        yearned?"
george," Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant 
        craving...but I haven't yearned."
george," Aw, Kramer, don't start..."
george," I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my 
        life!"
kramer," O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?"
george, No.
kramer, You got money?
george, No.
kramer, Do you have a woman?
george, No.
kramer, Do you have any prospects?
george, No.
kramer, You got anything on the horizon?
george, Uh...no.
kramer, Do you have any action at all?
george, No.
kramer," Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the 
        morning?"
george, I like to get the Daily News!
kramer," George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little 
        boys."
george, Why?
kramer," I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug."
george," Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too."
kramer," No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie."
george," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one 
        line! You got fired!"
kramer," I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you 
        coming with me?"
george," Uh, no, I'm not."
kramer," Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're 
        key brothers now. &lt;Gets up to leave.&gt;"
george," You're not really gonna go to California, are you?"
george," Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my 
        keys, so I need mine back from you."
elaine, Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
george," I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother."" 
      "
elaine, That's ridiculous.
elaine, I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
george, What for?
elaine, 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
george, Jerry? Why?
elaine, 'Cause he gave me his.
george, So what?
elaine," So, if he has my keys, I should have his. "
george," Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours."
elaine, I just said the same thing to you.
george, What?
elaine, What?
george," Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have 
        them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?"
elaine," Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. &lt;George begins to leaf through 
        papers on Elaine's counter.&gt; What are you doing? Would you just put 
        that down? &lt;Takes the papers away from George.&gt; I gotta get some 
        new friends."
jerry, Did you bring the keys? 
george," Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's 
        apartment without his permission."
jerry, This could be an emergency!
george, You never should have taken away his keys!
jerry," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. &lt;Jerry and 
        George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.&gt;"
george, How'd the Mets do?
jerry, They lost.
jerry, Kramer? 
jerry," Hello, Newman."
newman, You lookin' for someone?
jerry," Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!"
newman, Coy? I'm not being coy.
george," Yeah, coy."
jerry," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?"
jerry," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!"
newman," Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses."
jerry," Turn around, George."
george, Sure. &lt;Turns around.&gt;
newman, George?
jerry," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have 
        to do this the hard way? &lt;Hits wall with his fist.&gt;"
newman, Help! Help!
jerry, Where's Kramer?
newman, HELP! &lt;Elaine enters.&gt;
elaine, What's going on?
newman, They're gonna beat me up!
george, No we're not.
jerry, We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
newman," You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened 
        to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about 
        the keys. Thought he got a bad rap."
jerry, Bad rap?
newman, Yeah. From you.
jerry, Me?
newman," You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La 
        Land. L.A."
jerry, L.A.?
jerry," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! 
        I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? 
        I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't 
        you see it?"
elaine," Yeah, yeah, I saw it. &lt;mutters under her breath&gt; I mean, 
        it's complete bullsh*t."
jerry, Huh? 
elaine, What...?
jerry," No, what'd you say?"
elaine, Nothing. I didn't say anything.
jerry," Oh, you didn't see it."
elaine," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep."
jerry," I heard you say something, there."
elaine, I didn't say anything.
jerry," I'm calling Kramer's mother. &lt;Picks up the phone, dials.&gt; 
         I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard 
        something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the 
        music down? Could you turn the music down!"
george, Ask her about Kramer.
jerry, She's drunk out of her mind.
biker," About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time 
        of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in 
        the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! 
        Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down 
        right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered 
        all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, 
        when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they 
        pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told 
        me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 
        'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! &lt;The biker goes into a 
        turn.&gt; Lean! &lt;Kramer yells.&gt;"
george," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't 
        feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment."
jerry, Don't feel right? What are you talking about? 
george," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you 
        want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can 
        I just let you in?"
jerry, What is the big deal?
george," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle 
        you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's 
        keys."
jerry," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. 
        You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, 
        because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys."
george," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, 
        he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which 
        case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her."
jerry," Well, I want those keys. &lt;Tries to grab the keys from George.&gt;"
george," Nope, no can do."
jerry," George, give them to me, I want these keys. &lt;They struggle 
        over the keys.&gt; I don't want to get physical!"
george, Do you wanna fight?
jerry, Do you wanna fight?
george, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! &lt;The struggle continues.&gt;
kramer," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome 
        young prince."
kramer," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the 
        cruel, cruel world."
kramer," Oh, he's cold."
kramer," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny.  Hey, you can drop me 
        here!"
kramer," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now."
kramer," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' 
        in Ivory liquid? &lt;mimics choking somebody&gt;"
jerry," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna 
        give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's 
        happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to 
        me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give 
        her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has 
        mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could 
        get mine."
george," You're right, how did I miss that? &lt;Begins unlocking the door, 
        mutters under his breath&gt; Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t."
jerry, What's that?
george, Nothing.
jerry, I heard something.
george, Didn't say anything. 
kramer," So, how long you been drivin' this thing?"
woman, Goin' on four years. 
kramer," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi."
woman," Nothin'?  Listen to you, 
        you're quite the sweet-talker."
kramer," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch 
        those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. "
woman, You want to give it a try?
kramer, Really?
woman, Do you know how to double-clutch?
kramer, Yeah.
woman," Well, come on! &lt;They trade places and Kramer gets behind the 
        wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.&gt;"
george," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!"
jerry," Well, this is great. "
george," Well, what do they look like?"
jerry," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys.  ""What do they look like."""
george," Well, they're obviously not here."
jerry," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere."
george," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall 
        opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!"
george, What?
jerry, By Elaine Benes?
george, What?
jerry," Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?"
george, Lemme see this. 
jerry, Wait a second! 
george, Gimme half!
jerry," All right, here! "
george, Why didn't she tell us?
elaine, You weasels!
jerry, What? What?
elaine, How dare you!
george, We hardly read anything!
jerry, It was funny!
elaine," Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through 
        all my things? You thought it was funny?"
jerry, Well... &lt;picks up some of the pages&gt; From what I saw...
jerry," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys."
george, He forced me to!
jerry, I did not!
george, Yes you did!
elaine, You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
jerry," Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!"
elaine," Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!"
jerry, Good!
george," What, you don't want me to hold your keys?"
elaine," No, you can't be trusted!"
george," Alright, alright, fine. &lt;Gives the keys to Elaine.&gt;"
elaine, Good! I won't!
jerry, Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
elaine, These aren't my keys!
george, Whose are these?
elaine, I don't know!
elaine, I just thought I could write it.
jerry, Is that something you want to do?
elaine, I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
jerry," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard 
        work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch 
        the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to 
        each other."
elaine," O.K., can I just watch the show? &lt;mutters under her breath&gt; 
        God, what an asshole."
jerry, What did you say?
elaine, I didn't say anything.
jerry," I heard something. &lt;Looks at the TV&gt; Elaine, Elaine! It's 
        Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
jerry," Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!"
kramer," Oh, good morning, Miss Brown."
kramer," Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell."
kramer, Steven.
kramer, Oh - I'm familiar with it.
cast,
jerry, Well this is it.
p, This is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
jerry," Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that 
              garlic. "
p," Yeah, me too,"
jerry," No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things 
              were garlic."
p," Laughs - ha ha ha . Oh, you know what? I think 
              Naked "
jerry," No, I mean, I don't think so."
p," I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you uwere happy go lucky. 
            "
jerry," No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. 
              If anything"
n, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
jerry," That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. 
              Why don't you"
george,"  Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set 
              foe the week end. "
jerry, This thing has never worked right. 
n, You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? 
jerry," Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved 
              internationally known cartoon characters of "

              piece of plastic dividing the room. "
susan," Oh, "
george," What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think 
              like that dry cleaning plastic?"

              boy's house. "

              on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down."
george, I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
jerry,"  I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it

              the day."
george,"  I wonder how 
              Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the 
              worst he could do? So you burn"
jerry,"  C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a 
              cabin."
george, We could build a cabin like  that.
jerry,"  Well, maybe not us, but two men could."
george,"  Bics?

              you not talk to them for too long?"
sandra, Why? Did Jerry say something?
elaine," No, no."
sandra, He must have said something.
elaine," Oh, no, he didn't say anything."
sandra,"  I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving.

jerry," Yeah, come on.  What's 
              with you?"
kramer,  No more golf.
jerry, Why?
kramer," Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, 
              at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every 
              time I give him a couple"
jerry, Yeah.
kramer,"  Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!  Hey, George, maybe you can 
              ask Susan's father for"
george," What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars 
              after you burned down his cabin!"
kramer, Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
george," Kramer, please."
kramer," Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! 
              I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass 
              has big brown patches in it,"
george," Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them 
              some place else."
kramer,  Where? They're Cubans. 
george,  You know what? Maybe I should take off.
jerry, What?!
george," Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house 
              for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want 
              to leave myself plenty of time."
jerry,"  You got four hours! What about the 
              script?"
george, I think we got a bite on it. 
,
george," Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with 
              feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling 
              in virtual anonymity. I mean.."
george," Oh, uh, the cigars..  I'm, uh, suckin' 
              'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah."
george,"  I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. 
              "
susan,"  He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy."
susan,  Daddy never laughs.
george," Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what 
              is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? 
              What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?"
susan," Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk 
              to you about.."
george,"  Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. 
              well, "
,
jerry," Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her 
              that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm 
              responsible for this"
elaine,"  I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. 
              Would you call her?"
jerry,  Ohh.. dial the number.  How could you do this?
elaine,"  I was just trying to help 
              you."
jerry,"  Oh, just trying to  help me..  Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry

,
george, The cabin..  Well..  Susan?
susan, Uhh.. about the cabin..
george,"  Kinda like Superman's fortress 
              of solitude."
george," S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude 
              up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it 
              all.."
susan, Daddy..
susan," Daddy, about the cabin.."
susan," Well, the thing is.."
susan," Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?"
george,  Burned.
susan," There was a fire, and it uh.. "
george, Burned.
george,"  yeah, burned. Whoo.."
susan,  No. Nothing.
george," Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole 
              situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's 
              really rather ironic - one might even"
,
sandra,  I can't believe you said that!
jerry, What?!
sandra,"  How could you say something like 
              that to me?!"
jerry," What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was 
              just trying to keep up!"
sandra, That was a weird thing to say.
jerry," Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join 
              in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed."
sandra," Ohh, I think you're really sick."
jerry,"  I'm not sick.  
              You - you said much sicker things than me."
sandra, I'm leaving. 
jerry, I really think you're making too much of this.
sandra,  Excuse me. 
jerry, Let me walk you to a cab.
sandra,  That's ok.
jerry," I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, 
              and that'll be the end of it."
sandra," Oh, really? "
jerry,"  I mean, people - they're not interested 
              in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really 
              don't."
,
jerry," So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she 
              starts rubbing my leg."
george, Wo-hoah! What did you do?
jerry,"  Have you ever told a woman to stop touching 
              your leg?"
george," Yeah, right."
jerry," I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in 
              Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off 
              my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the"
george," Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do 
              they do that?"
jerry," I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.."
george," Alright, so, go ahead."
jerry, So we go back to my apartment..
george,  Woah. Whoa! Woah!
jerry," So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting 
              a little passionate..  and, uh, she starts"
george,"  Alright, alright, hold on!  Time out! Woah, woah!  What did she say?"
jerry,"  Oh, you know, the usual.."
george," No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?"
jerry, Typical things.
george,"  What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme 
              some typical."
jerry," She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so 
              shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup 
              bottle - ketchup squirts out"
george,"  That's very dirty.  That's 
              absolutely filthy."
jerry, ..And then she starts talking about her panties.
george,  Gonna need some water here!
jerry, So I said something.
george," Ok, what did you say?"
jerry,"  Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep 
              up."
george, Of course.
jerry," Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I 
              said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"""
george,"  ""The panties your mother laid 
              out for you""?  What"
jerry,  I don't know! It just popped out.
george," Well, how did she react?"
jerry, She flipped out! Just left.
george," Well, that's not offensive.  It's abnormal, but 
              it's not offensive."
jerry," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about 
              any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. 
              And she's never let me"
jerry," She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her 
              into it - how stupid was that? "
george," Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing."
jerry, I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
george," Huh.  C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today."
jerry,"  Alright, big work day."
george, That's right.

george, Okay.

kramer,"  Oh, yeah?"
jerry, Yeah!
kramer," Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some 
              more cigars?"
george,"  No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that."
kramer,"  Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have 
              to take matters into my own hands, huh?  Alright, I'll see

jerry, What?
elaine," I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to 
              work."
jerry," Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think 
              about it - there's no two ways about it."
elaine, Why? What happened? Did you talk?
jerry," Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! 
              We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks 
              that this isn't anybody you should"
elaine, Really?
jerry, Yes.
elaine, Really? You really think I should fire her?
jerry," Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy

              So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!"
jerry, What calls?!
elaine," Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've 
              been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!"
jerry," Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?"
elaine,"  ""Anything else""? What do you mean 
              ""anything else""?"
jerry," So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about 
              anything?"
elaine, Yeah!
jerry,  Beautiful.
elaine, Why is that beautiful?
jerry," Oh, no, not beautiful."
elaine, It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
jerry," Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that."

              encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-"
elaine,  Okay.

              smoke?"
kramer," Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. 
               This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto."

kramer,"  Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're 
              going.  Vamanos, muchachos!"
elaine,"  Hey, what are 
              you reading?"
george," Oh, uh, ""The Falconer"" by John Cheever. It's 
              really excellent."
elaine,"  John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?"
jerry," Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing.  Alright,  look, we gotta"
elaine,"  Ok, I'll leave you two alone."
jerry,  Okay.
elaine,"  Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just 
              bought me some new panties  and they're - all laid"
jerry, We're dead.
george, We're not dead.
jerry, We are dead.
george, Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
jerry," All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with 
              something and we didn't do anything."
george, So we'll do it tomorrow.
jerry," Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went 
              skiing?"
george, About six years ago.
jerry, I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
george, Women like skiers.
jerry, So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
george, Yeah. Right.
jerry," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the 
              one on the right. She's in the closet business."
george, The closet business? What's the closet business?
jerry, What is it your business?
george, I'm interested.
jerry," She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize 
              your closet space. She looked into my closet."
george," So you thought she was good looking and figured this would 
              be a good way to meet her."
jerry, Yeah.
george, Yeah. So what happened?
jerry," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. 
              What do I need more closet space for?  Hi, Marla."
marla,  Jerry.
jerry," George, Marla."
george, Marla.
marla," George. Jerry, Stacey."
jerry, Stacey.
stacey, Jerry.
jerry," George, Stacey."
george, Stacey.
stacey, George.
jerry, George.
george, Jerry. Marla.  Stacey! 
marla," So, how was your trip to Berlin?"
jerry, Trip to Berlin?
marla," Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You 
              said you were going to Berlin for a while."
jerry," Oh, right, right."
marla," The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted 
              to be part of the celebration."
jerry," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, 
              and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains 
              out?"""
marla," You, know my boyfriend went."
jerry, Really?
marla," Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited 
              and decided to go."
jerry," Oh, did he like it?"
marla, I don't know. He never came back. 
george," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave 
              us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got 
              a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story 
              before we can write."
stacey," Wow, what a great job. A writer."
george, Not a bad way to make a buck.
stacey, Sounds great.
george," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, 
              it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is 
              my gift. "
jerry," So, are you gonna go out with her?"
george, I might.
jerry, What about Susan?
george," What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody 
              else?"
jerry, Depends.
george, Depends on what?
jerry, On many factors.
george, Like what?
jerry," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone 
              call frequency? Are you on a daily?"
george, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
jerry," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, 
              or is a date implied?"
george, Implied.
jerry, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
george, There might be some moisturizer.
jerry," Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your 
              house?"
george,  Yeah.
jerry," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here."
george, What?
jerry, You got yourself a girlfriend.
george," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?"
jerry," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his 
              house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help 
              you out, but..."
george," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I 
              have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" 
              and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when 
              you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get 
              girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, 
              you just want more girlfriends."
jerry, You're going to make a good father someday.
george," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, 
              all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing."
jerry, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
george," No, what?"
jerry," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over."
george, Why? What do you mean?
jerry," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's 
              gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's 
              one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna 
              pick us up?"
george," Oh, right. Oh no, man."
jerry," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have 
              a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. 
              But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the 
              girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?"
george," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? 
              What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll 
              still like me and it doesn't affect the deal."
jerry,"  Oh, yeah."
george," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very 
              quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David 
              Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. 
              Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. 
              I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they 
              fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman."
jerry, This is your plan?
george," No, no. I'm just thinking."
jerry, I don't think you are.
marla, Let me tell you what I think.
jerry," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity."
marla, Are you very fussy about your pants?
jerry, I don't think I am.
marla, Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
jerry, Try me.
marla," Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, 
              the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. 
              We'll put everything on hooks."
jerry, Everything?
marla," Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We 
              could get eighty hooks on here."
jerry," You're quite mad, you know.  Oh, I don't 
              believe this.  Hey?"
kramer, Hey.
jerry, What are you doing?
kramer, I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
jerry, No.
kramer, What?
jerry, This is not a good time.
kramer, Five minutes. What?
jerry, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
kramer," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. 
              I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells."
jerry," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. "
kramer," Well, wow."
jerry," Marla, Kramer."
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
kramer," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me."
jerry, There's weather.
kramer," Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for 
              me."
jerry, I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
kramer," No, no, I don't want it back.  Are you gonna watch 
              the Knick game tonight?"
jerry, I don't know.
kramer, Will you tape it?
jerry, Kramer... 
kramer, Yeah. 
jerry, So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
marla, Never came back.
jerry," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall."
marla, It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
jerry, Ah hah.  Excuse me one second. Yeah?
elaine, It's me.
jerry," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. 
              I don't know what she's doing here now.  I'm sorry. What?"
elaine, I didn't get it.
jerry, Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
marla," Well, he wanted me to move in with him."
jerry, Snapple?
marla, No thanks.
jerry, Go on.
marla, Well I wouldn't move in because...
jerry, Yes.
marla, Well because...
jerry, Yeah.
marla, Well because I'm a virgin. 
elaine, Hello!
jerry," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine."
elaine," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted 
              to return your tape."
jerry," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five 
              dollars to see Havana."
elaine," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting."
marla, I should be going.
elaine," No, no, I'm leaving."
jerry, I like that thing in your hair there.
elaine," Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party 
              I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple? "
marla, No thanks. 
elaine," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened 
              to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. 
              So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, 
              it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me 
              this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, 
              big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, 
              like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. 
              You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  
              Ahh. "
marla, I should be going.
jerry, So we'll talk about the hooks then?
marla, Yes. 
elaine, What? Was it something I said?
jerry," She's a virgin, she just told me."
elaine, Well I didn't know.
jerry, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
elaine," Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? 
              Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?"
jerry," No, no, I mean..."
elaine, 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. 
jerry," Elaine, Elaine...  Yeah?"
george, It's George.
george, She's a virgin?
jerry, A virgin.
george, Wow. So what're you gonna do?
jerry," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's 
              so sexy."
george," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember 
              the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten."
jerry," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have 
              any of that Lewis and Clark in you."
george," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.  I'm really hungry."
jerry," Yeah, me too."
george," We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting 
              on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?"
jerry," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me 
              just call Kramer, see if want anything.  Hey, we ordering 
              Chinese food. If you want anything--  let 
              me know what it is and I'll order for you."
kramer, I'm in. Let's go for it.
george, What do you want?
kramer," I don't care, whatever."
george," I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes 
              and we'll just share 'em."
kramer, Okay. What are you getting?
george, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
kramer, What's a Chow Fung?
george, It's a broad noodle.
kramer," What do you mean, a broad noodle?"
george, It's a big flat noodle.
kramer, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
george, What kind of noodle do you want?
kramer, Who says I want a noodle?
george," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have 
              to have any."
kramer," All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of 
              my pea pods."
george, Fine.
kramer, Get extra MSG.
elaine," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. 
              Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man 
              changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's 
              over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really 
              quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want 
              to flee the scene before the police get there."
marla, So they just leave?
elaine," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working 
              on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta 
              get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn 
              into farmers suddenly."
marla, Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
elaine, Eh.
jerry," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the 
              meeting. "
george, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
jerry," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two 
              hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get 
              through this meeting.  There's your food."
george," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist 
              is uninsured, you with me?"
jerry, Yeah.
george," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely 
              no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees 
              that he becomes my butler."
jerry, Your butler?
george," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all 
              my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program."
jerry, What about me?
george," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. "
jerry,"  That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. 
              Sentenced to be a butler.  Ping, what happened?"
elaine, There was a bit of an accident.
ping, Head hurts. Head really hurts.
jerry, What happened?
elaine," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing 
              the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the 
              way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his 
              head and everything went flying."
george, Something happened to the food?
ping, I only saved one bag.
jerry, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
marla, I'll get some ice.
george,"  The pea pods? All you saved 
              was the pea pods? "
kramer," Hey, you got the food?"
jerry," Yeah, here."
kramer," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!"
ping, Kramer. 
kramer, Yeah. Where's yours?
george, He dropped it.
kramer," Oh, that's too bad."
elaine," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to 
              go that fast."
ping," No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked."
kramer,"  Hey, you watchin' Oprah?"
elaine,  I did not jaywalk.
jerry,  You're givin' him back that TV.
ping,"  Yes, you jaywalked."
kramer,"  No, I don't want it back."
ping,  Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
george,  We got work to do. What about the meeting?
kramer,"  Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze."
jerry," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe 
              we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because 
              Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, 
              and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools 
              of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. 
              I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been 
              on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? 
              It's like that  , like that! One bad impression, 
              you're outta the business!"
george," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here."
jerry, What do you mean? They know we're here.
george," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I 
              can't believe, my back."
jerry," No, no, would you get up?"
george," I can do this, Jerry."
jerry, No.
george," All right, I'll tell them my sister died.  My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing 
              and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're 
              livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my 
              poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor 
              family."
jerry, What?
george," That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk 
              by. I'll be right back. "
woman," Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. "
jerry," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. "
jerry," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello."
rita," Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson."
jerry," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?"
rita," He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of 
              Blossom."
jerry," Oh, poor Blossom. "
rita," Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him."
jerry," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman."
susan, David Letterman's on the floor?
jerry," Yeah, he just walked by. "
rita," Well, I think we should get started anyway."
jerry," Yeah, good idea."
rita, So how are you guys comin' along?
jerry," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas."
rita, Good. 
jerry," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell 
              you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' 
              there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very 
              funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for 
              the table.  Because we've all been in 
              that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... 
              and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?"
rita, So that's the idea?
jerry," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea 
              where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance 
              and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You 
              know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, 
              he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of 
              those big neck collars."
george," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful 
              or what? Hey, sorry I'm late.  Russell?"
rita, I'm Rita Kearson.
george," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to 
              see you. Jay, always a pleasure.  Sweetie.  Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, 
              that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought 
              I was getting the butler."
jerry," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you."
jerry," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?"
george," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time 
              I should probably break the Prozacs in half."
kramer," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy."
jerry, Would you give him the TV back?
kramer," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
george," I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over 
              there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? "
kramer,  Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
susan, Hello?
george," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?"
susan," What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going 
              on. I'm fired!"
george, Fired? Why?
susan," Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! 
              Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone."
kramer,  What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
george, But I had no... I didn't realize.
susan," You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! 
              You're a stupid, stupid man!"
george, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
kramer,"  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed."
susan, I'll speak to you later.
george,"  this is great! He fired her! 
              This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!"
jerry, Why did he fire her?
george," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, 
              he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!"
kramer," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!"
jerry," You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. 
              You got her fired. You gotta be there for her."
george, What?
jerry, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
george, Another job?
jerry, Couple of interviews.
george," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think 
              I'm out, they pull me back in. "
marla," Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have 
              sex."
jerry, What? Leave? Where? Why?
marla," You know, the apartment."
jerry, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
marla, Well what if it was my apartment?
jerry, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
marla, Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
jerry," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has 
              to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I 
              mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole 
              structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was 
              in bad shape."
marla, Maybe I should get going.
jerry, What else did you say to her?
elaine, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
jerry," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another 
              cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent."
elaine," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe 
              me."
jerry," What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with 
              you?"
elaine," You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served 
              with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. 
              You better be nice to her."
jerry, I was trying to be.
elaine," Look at George.  He 
              lucked out, huh?"
jerry," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break 
              up with him? They had a good thing going."
elaine," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family 
              cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, 
              and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had 
              a real good thing going."
george," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm 
              writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now."
woman," A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's 
              writing a sitcom."
carol," A sitcom? Come on, let's go. "
woman," A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use 
              it to hit on me!"
broadcasted," November 18, 1992 for the first time."
stars," Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, "
,
jerry,  Let me ask you a question.
elaine, Mm-hm.
jerry," You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-"
elaine,"  Who, me?"
jerry," You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're 
              chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think 
              they would ever consider doing"
elaine,"  They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
kramer,"  You! Take off your socks, 
              your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it 
              off, take it off!"
kramer," Hey, Georgie."
jerry,  What's the matter?
george,  My mother caught me.
jerry," ""Caught"" you? Doing what?"
george, You know.  I was alone..
elaine,  You mean..?!
george,  Uh-huh.
kramer,  She caught you?
jerry, Where?
george,"  ..I stopped by the house 
              to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody 
              was there - they're supposed"
jerry," ""Glamour""?"
george," ..So, one thing lead to another.."
jerry," So, what did she do?"
george," First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My 
              God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started 
              clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it."
krmaer,  Man..
george," I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, 
              or zip up."
jerry, What did you do?
george, I zipped up!
elaine,"  So, she fell?"
george," Yeah.  Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!"
elaine," No, I guess you couldn't have.."
jerry,"  No, I wouldn't 
              think so."
elaine,  ..done that.
george," So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My 
              back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
elaine,  How is she?
george,  She's in traction.
elaine,"  Ok, I'm sorry."
george," It's not funny, Elaine."
elaine,  I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
george," Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of 
              days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, 
              why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's"
jerry," ""Glamour""?"
george,"  Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never 
              doing.. that , again."
elaine," What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?"
george,  All together.
elaine," Oh, gimme a break.."
jerry,  Ohhh yeah.. right.
kramer," Oh, like you're gonna stop?"
george, You don't think I can?
jerry, No chance.
george,  You think you could?
jerry," Well, I know I could hold out longer than you."
george, Care to make it interesting?
jerry," Sure, how much?"
george, A hundred dollars.
jerry,  You're on.
kramer,"  Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in 
              on this. "
jerry, You?
kramer, Yeah.
jerry, You'll be out before we get the check.
elaine,"  I want to be in on this, too."
elaine, Why?
jerry,  It's apples and oranges..
elaine," What? Why?  
              Why?"
jerry, Because you're a woman!
elaine, So what?
jerry, It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
elaine,  Oh.
jerry," We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, 
              uh.. shaving."
elaine," Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
kramer,  Not everyday.
george," Alright, look, you want to be in?"
elaine, Yeah!
george," You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta 
              put up two-hundred dollars."
kramer," No, a thousand!"
elaine," No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
george," Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
jerry,"  Okay, one-fifty."
george," Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?"
jerry," Well, obviously, we all know each other very well,  I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within 
              the confines of the honor system."
kramer, Alright. 
,
george,"  No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I 
              don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, 
              I'll see you later. Yes, of course"
jerry,  ..Yeah?
george,  Whatever.
jerry, How is she?
george,"  She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital 
              to see her tonight."
jerry,  Yeah?
elaine, It's me.
jerry, Come on up. 
george," Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
jerry,  Dating Marla.
george," Oh, the virgin?"
jerry, Yeah.
george," Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
jerry," Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just 
              waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
kramer," Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across 
              the street."
jerry, Where?
kramer," Second floor from the top.  See the window on 
              the left?"
george,  Wow!
jerry,  Who walks around the house like that?!
george,"  Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist 
              colony people.."
kramer, ..Yeah..  yeah.. 
jerry," Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, 
              do they eat naked in the dining room?"
george, I would imagine it's all naked.
jerry," What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?"
george,"  They're naked, the gardeners 
              naked.. the bellhops.  One 
              big nude-a-rama."
elaine, Hey.
elaine," Well,  where's my money? Who caved?"
jerry,  Not me.
george,  Not me.
elaine, What're you looking at?
jerry, There's a naked woman across the street.
elaine,"  This is gonna be the easiest money 
              I've ever made in my life.  So, my fried, 
              Joyce, is teaching an aerobics"
jerry,"  Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it 
              back."
elaine,"  So 
              then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to 
              go on the space shuttle. We're goin'"
jerry,  Uh-huh.
george, Have a good time.
kramer,  I'm out!
elaine, What?!
kramer," Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest."
george, You're out?!
kramer," Yeah, yeah..  what?"
elaine," Well, that was fast!"
jerry," Well, it was that woman across the street.  You 
              know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks 
              out, shutting the door"
elaine, ..And then there were three.
,
elaine," I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing 
              better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a 
              quart of milk, I come home, and find"
george,  Ma.
estelle," Don't give me ""Ma"". It's a good thing I didn't 
              hit the table. I could of cracked my head open."
george," Ma, people can hear you."
estelle,"  Too bad you can't do that for a living. 
              You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square 
              Garden. Thousands of"
george,"  Alright, Ma, that's enough!"
estelle, I want you to go see a psychiatrist.

george," Well, I am not going."
estelle, It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
shelly," Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?"
george,"  Is that important, really? What is this, a police 
              investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive 
              the experience now?!"

              nuts."
jerry," Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital."

jerry, Really? Did you talk to him?
elaine," No, you don't understand - he was working out right in

jerry," But the question is, are you still master of your domain?"
elaine,  I'm queen of the castle.

george," Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's 
              in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit."
estelle," I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this."
george, You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
estelle," You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. 
              I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the 
              deli and get me a"

george,"  I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a 
              little time with you."

joyce, Let me just put this back. 
elaine, No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
joyce,  He asked about you.
elaine,"  He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about 
              me?!  What 
              did he say?"
joyce, He wanted to know your situation.
elaine,  What situation? I have a situation?
joyce, I-I told him you were single.
elaine, That was good. That was very good.
joyce, He said you were just his type.
elaine,"  Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to 
              hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt 
              me."
joyce," He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood 
              tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your 
              building if you want to"

              like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!"
jerry,"  Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep 
              one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They

jerry, What happened?
elaine, It was..uh.. John-John.
jerry, But you made it through the day before.
elaine," Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, 
              that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight."
jerry, Why outside here?
elaine," Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a 
              cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."
jerry," Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me."
george," And then,  there were two."

marla, I know how difficult this must have been for you.
jerry,  You don't know the half of it.
marla, What do you mean?
jerry," Well, it's kinda silly, but.."
marla, Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
jerry," No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with 
              George and his mother-"
marla," I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close 
              I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind."
elaine," Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-"
marla," I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted 
              friends.  Ooohh, get away from me! 
              You're horrible."
,

              I gotta go.."
george," No, no, no. He just left."
elaine, What?
george," Yeah, he was talking to Marla."
jerry, Marla?
george," Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he 
              was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and 
              they just drove away."
elaine,"  He left with Marla, the virgin?"
george, Yeah.
elaine, They drove away?
george," Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You 
              know, he's - he's-"
jerry,  Oh my God in heaven!
elaine,  Is that..?
george, Kramer?!
elaine, He's waving..

george," I loved her Jerry, I loved her. "
jerry," No, you didn't."
george," And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did."
jerry, No she didn't.
george," What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. 
            I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?"
elaine,"  Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like 
            her."
george, Who says? 
elaine, You did.
george," Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love 
              with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest 
              of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment 
              watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around 
            with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry."
jerry, You walk around with no underwear?
george," Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?"
jerry, I do a wash.
george," Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, 
            Jerry. No one's better than her."
jerry, When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
george, I loved her! 
jerry," You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being 
            taken to a cell."
george, I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.            
george, I gotta call her. Should I call her?
jerry," George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?"
george, Whyie?
jerry," You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see 
            Elaine's friend? She's a therapist. "
george," I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe 
            with."
jerry," No, no no  Elaine what's 
              the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the 
            woman."

kramer," Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta 
            listen to the little man."
george, My little man doesn't know.
kramer, The little man knows all. 
george, My little man's an idiot.
elaine," See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a 
            card. I should do that. I never do anything like that. "
kramer," You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can 
            do that for you. ..."
george, She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.            
elaine," No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture 
            on a card."
kramer," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything."
george," She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what 
            she put in those eggs. "
kramer," All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal 
            and I'll take your picture."

            over there."
elaine," All right, ha ha "
kramer, I don't know about that outfit though. 
elaine, Why? What's wrong with it?
kramer," Well, we'll have to improvise."
george,"  Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful 
              girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my 
            baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ..."
jerry, George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.            
jerry," So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right 
            here."
tia, Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?
jerry," Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush 
            them down the toilet."
tia, That's horrible!
jerry, What's that perfume you're wearing?
tia," oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN

jerry, What is that smell?
tia, It's here somewhere.
jerry, It smells like the beach.
tia, Exactly. 
jerry, Oh my God is that the new perfume? 
tia, Yeah.
jerry," I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea 
              for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive 
            at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea."
tia, Are you sure?
jerry, And you're the model for this perfume?
jerry," Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door "

kramer," What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall 
            she was."
jerry," Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference 
            who's tall. We're all tall."
kramer, What's that?

tia, It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.
kramer," CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole 
              my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell 
            like you just came from the beach."
jerry, I know look at this 
kramer," Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp 
              he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. 
              I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not 
            going to get away with this."
dana," Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about 
            you. Please sit down."
george," Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, 
              uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with 
              my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with 
              me  and uh, well, I was the cause 
              of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with 
            this thing?"
dana," So uh, she broke up with you? ... "
george," Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down? "
dana," It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break 
            up with you?"
george, What is with this damn zipper?
dana," It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your 
            girlfriend."
george," It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth 
            out."
dana," It doesn't matter, so ..."
george," This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, 
            ..."
dana," George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. 
            ... What's your girlfriend's name?"
george, ... Susan.
dana," Okay, we're getting somewhere."
george," UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new 
            jacket."
elaine," Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work 
            for that Church on Amsterdam."
jerry," Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday 
              season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped 
              by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at 
              what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't 
            have to go to all that trouble."
elaine, It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
jerry, I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
elaine," Well, you know. It's a picture?"
jerry, Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
elaine," Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?"
jerry, ... um ...
elaine, What?
jerry, Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
elaine, Carefully?
jerry," Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong 
            but I think I see ... a nipple."
elaine, What?
jerry," Here. Take a look. What, what is that?"
elaine,  Oh my God! That's my nipple. 
jerry, That's what I thought.
elaine," That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card 
            to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa. "
jerry, DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
elaine," Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You 
              know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide 
              your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their 
            own personal shot of it. "
kramer, Hey!
elaine, Have you seen the card? 
kramer, What card?
elaine, This car.
kramer," Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it."
elaine, Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
kramer, No.
elaine, Well come here and take a look. 
kramer," Yeah, so?"
elaine," So, what's that?"
kramer, That's a nipple.
elaine, Right!!
kramer, Ooo!
elaine," Aw, great!? Didn't you see that? "
kramer," Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh, "
elaine, It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt. 
jerry," Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let 
            me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it."
elaine, No. I don't want him looking.
jerry, Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.            
elaine," Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. 
              My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. 
            Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred."
nx, Okay. What is it?
jerry," Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything 
            unusual about it."
nx, Your nipple's showing.
jerry, Okay. Thanks.
nx, Anything else? 
jerry, No. 
nx, All right. See you later.
jerry," What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. 
            What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them. "
kramer, I got them too. 
jerry, Everybody's got them. 
dana," You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped 
            underneath and it's ..."
george, Pull it up a little bit.
dana," Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. 
              God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had 
            it. "
george," Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate. "
dana, No. Let me try...
george, Take it right off the chest...
dana," Ugh, .."
george, You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
dana," YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have 
            to stop."
george," Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. 
            ... Oh,Elaine?"
dana, Yeah.
george, 
jerry," No, No, No, No, Oh, No."
jerry," Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned 
            one call. "
george, Was it a scratch or a pick? 
jerry, It was a scratch. 
george, Hey. It's me.
jerry," Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and 
            a scratch? "
jerry, Yeah?
elaine,  It's me. 
jerry, Come on up. 
george, Was there any nostril penetration?
jerry," There may have been some incidental penetration. But from 
            her angle she was in no position to make the call. "
george," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so 
            then what?"
jerry," Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? 
            Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? "
george," I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh 
              the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me 
            you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. "
jerry," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody 
              and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue 
            going out with her?"
george, No. That's disgusting! 
elaine," You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is 
              plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... 
              Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep 
              asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy 
              I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ...  
            Oh please!"
george," Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody 
              else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good 
            friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it. "
elaine," You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All 
              right here.  Here's your Christmas 
            card. "
kramer, Got any Double Crunch?
jerry, yeah. I think I do. 
kramer, What's that perfume?
elaine," What, Ocean."
kramer," That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that 
            model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN."
jerry," I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me 
            in a pick at a light."
kramer, I thought you said it was a scratch. 
jerry, But that's not what she thinks. 
george," Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of 
            town and she didn't get the calls. "
jerry," All right. I'll call the agency.  Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. 
              Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. 
              well thank you very much.  She has been in town. She's 
            at CALVIN KLEIN's right now."
kramer, Let's go. 
george, It'll be different this time. 
susan, I need someone a little more stable.
george," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, 
              you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these 
              glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? 
            Costanza! "
susan, People don't change.
george," I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled 
              egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there 
            and I'm loving it. "
susan, I'm not a soft boiled egg. 
george, And I am not a piece of toast. 
susan, I just don't think we have anything in common. 
george," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his 
              wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the 
              cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, 
              consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in 
            the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. "
susan, Why were there so many cockroaches? 
george," Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. 
              Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments 
             "
susan, And they got along?
george," Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. 
            He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!"
kramer, I want to talk to Calvin.
secretary, You can't go in there.
kramer, Let me talk to Calvin.

kramer," Yeah, uh."
kramer, I'm here to talk about the ocean. 
kramer, Now I don't want any trouble Calvin. 
jerry, Hello there you are.
tia, What are you doing here?
jerry," Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been 
            returning my calls."
tia," Well, I've been busy."
jerry," Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, 
              an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that 
            you caught me (flustered, he"
tia,  I'd rather not talk about this..
jerry, But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

jerry, A smirk?
george, Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
jerry, I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
george," No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having 
              sex. It just completely changes the relationship."
kramer," Alright. I'm ready.  You know, I still don't 
              understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?"

              men."
jerry, I really don't eat it.
estelle," What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you 
              take them home? Give them to someone in your building?"

              sandwiches in the building.."

elaine, Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
george," To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want 
              me to do?"
frank," Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?"
estelle," I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay 
              check every week.."
george, I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
frank,"  You know, I couldn't bring myself 
              to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia."
estelle, So what are you gonna do?!
george," I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent 
              - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!"
frank, I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
george,  Oh my God..
frank," I don't like this waiter.  Look at him.. He sees us.. 
              he doesn't want to come over."
george,"  I need 
              some air.."
estelle," George, where are you going?!"

george,"  I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you.."

              asked me to, that's why!"

elaine, See what? 
george," Yes, I saw that. "
jerry, What was all that sniffing? 
elaine, I don't know. 
jerry, You don't think...? 
elaine," Oh, no! Come on Jerry. "
george, He was definitely sniffing. 
jerry," I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. 
              Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write 
              checks to himself right out of my account. "
elaine," I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs. 
            "
jerry," Then, what was all that sniffing? "
elaine, Maybe it's the cold weather. 
jerry, Today is not cold. 
george," All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting 
              me. "
elaine, Don't forget to wash your hands before supper. 
frank, Why do you need all that ketchup for? 
george," This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could 
              have as much as I want. "
frank," So, I talked to Phil Casacof today. "
estelle, Phil Casacof? 
frank," Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they 
              are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next 
              Friday with his boss. "
george," Next Friday, what time? "
frank, 2 o'clock. 
george," That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers. 
            "
frank, You can look for sneakers the next day! 
estelle, He doesn't know anything about bras. 
george," I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know? "
frank," Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss 
              it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where 
              is you bra? Give him a bra to look. "
estelle, I am not giving him a bra. 
frank, Why not? 
estelle, Because I don't need him looking at my bra. 
frank," Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what 
              he's talking about!?! "
george, Do we have to...? 
frank, You don't even know what they're made from. 
george, They are made from lycra-spandex. 
frank, Get out of here! Lycra-spandex? 
estelle, I think they are made from lycra-spandex. 
frank, Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet? 
estelle, I'm not betting! 
frank, Take a look. 
estelle," All right, I'll get a bra. "
frank, I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?! 
george, She doesn't want to get a bra. 
frank," I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, 
              but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it. "
george," All right, it wouldn't kill me. "
frank," How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? 
              You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you 
              know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups. "
george, I-I know about the cups. 
frank," You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest. "
george," I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on 
              knowing that the D is the biggest. "
estelle," Here, here's the bra. "
frank, Let me see it. 
estelle, 100% lycra-spandex. 
frank, Let me see it. 
estelle," I told you. Here, think you know everything? "
frank," Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the 
              cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's 
              about it. "
george," I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. "
estelle, You got ketchup on it! 
kramer," Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing? "
jerry," Sniffing, with his nose. "
kramer," Jerry, he probably had a cold. "
jerry," No, I asked him. "
kramer," So, what are you saying? "
jerry," I don't know, you know, what if...? "
kramer, Drugs? You think he's on drugs? 
jerry, I don't know. All I know he was sniffing. 
kramer," Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together. "
jerry, I know. 
kramer," And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this 
              guy. We trusted you. "
jerry," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just 
              means he was sniffing. "
kramer," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? 
              Did he use the word 'man'? "
jerry," No, he didn't use 'man'. "
kramer, I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ? 
jerry," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. "
kramer, Whoh! 
jerry, Do you think that's a bad sign? 
kramer," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! 
              All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money 
              back, right? "
jerry," I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it? 
            "
kramer, Yeah. 
elaine," Hello.... hello, oh... "
jake," Well, you notice anything? "
elaine," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making 
              dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man. "
jake, Ooh... 
elaine, Did anyone call? 
jake," I got a few messages, I wrote them down. "
elaine, Where are they? 
jake," Lets see, they are...here they are. "
elaine," Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! 
              Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? "
jake, She did. 
elaine," She did? Oh, that's so great! "
jake, Where do you keep the corkscrew? 
elaine, In the drawer on the right. Hmm... 
jake, What? 
elaine, Oh it's nothing. 
jake, What is it? 
elaine, It's nothing. 
jake, Tell me. 
elaine," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation 
              point? "
jake, What are you talking about? 
elaine," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", 
              but you didn't use an exclamation point. "
jake, So? 
elaine," So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it 
              curious. "
jake, What's so curious about it? 
elaine," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and 
              I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point. 
            "
jake," Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly 
              as you do. "
elaine," You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an 
              exclamation point. "
jake," Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was 
              required to capture the mood of each caller. "
elaine," I just thought you would be a little more excited about 
              a friend of mine having a baby. "
jake," Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation 
              points. "
elaine," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like 
              the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points 
              at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! 
            "
jake," Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving! "
jerry, You're out of your mind you know that. 
elaine, What? 
jerry," It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under 
              it. "
elaine," Well, I felt a call for one. "
jerry," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. 
              I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. 
            "
elaine, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. 
jerry, George was right. Didn't take you long. 
kramer, Anything new on that guy on drugs? 
elaine, He's not on drugs. 
kramer," Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff* 
              sniffing? "
elaine," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing 
              right now. "
jerry, Good idea. 
jerry," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. "
voice, I'm sorry he's out of town. 
jerry, Out of town? 
voice," Yes, he went to South America. "
jerry, South America? 
kramer, South America? 
jerry," I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! "
kramer, Yyyeeaaah!! 
elaine, So what? 
jerry, Who goes to South America? 
elaine, People go to South America. 
jerry," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large 
              intestine. "
elaine," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an 
              entire continent? "
jerry," Yes, I'm impugning a continent. "
kramer," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! "
newman," Hey, hey... "
jerry, Hello Newman. 
newman," Hello Jerry. So, any news? "
kramer," Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America! 
            "
newman," South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us 
              mixed up with? "
elaine," Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. 
              This is all speculation and hearsay. "
kramer," Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. 
              You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. "
elaine," What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and 
              dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean 
              come on... "
jerry," Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and 
              find out... "
newman," If we put our three heads together we should come up with 
              something. "
kramer, What's today? 
newman, It's Thursday. 
kramer, Really? Feels like Tuesday. 
newman," Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, 
              Sunday has a feel.... "
kramer, I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... 
jerry," All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. 
              Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. "
newman," Hey, you know this is kind of fun. "
kramer," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... "
jerry, Yeah maybe you should. 
kramer, Maybe I will. 
newman," Yeah, me too. "
jerry," All right, what are you gonna say to him? "
kramer, Just gonna find out if he's interested. 
newman," Hey, hey maybe I should go with him? "
jerry," No, you stay in the car. "
newman, Who made you the leader? 
jerry," All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out 
              of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar. "
kramer," All right, I'm going in. "
jerry, Be careful Kramer. 
newman, I've should've gone in with him. 
jerry," No, you stay here in the car. I may need you. "
newman, What you need me in the car for? 
jerry, I might need you to get me a soda. 
kramer," I'll have a brewsky , Charlie. "
bartender, Name's Mitch. 
kramer," Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh? 
            "
barry, Yeah. 
kramer," Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then 
              again, I've been known to do a lot of things. "
kramer, Cigarette? 
barry," No, I never touch them. "
kramer," I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good 
              all the time. "
kramer," Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh? 
            "
barry, I don't think so. 
kramer, Me neither. 
jerry," You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 
            "
newman, I use dental tape. 
jerry, You should try this. 
newman, I don't wanna. 
jerry, Not even once? 
newman, No. 
jerry, You're an idiot. 
newman," Why, because I use dental tape? "
jerry," Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. "
kramer, South America? 
barry," Yeah, yeah. "
kramer, That's importuning continent. 
barry, They are expanding their economic base. 
kramer, Tell me about it. 
barry," Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. "
kramer, I'm hip. 
barry, Hip to the what? 
kramer, To the whole scene. *sniff* 
barry, What scene? 
kramer," The bathroom scene. *sniff, sniff* "
barry," Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming 
              back I'm sitting over there. "
newman," No, no I don't like it. "
jerry," What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like 
              it? "
newman, I like the thick tape. 
barry, Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you? 
farkus," So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras. 
            "
george," Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much 
              indeed, sir. "
farkus, Have you ever sold a woman's line before? 
george," No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, 
              top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled. 
            "
farkus, Hum. tell me about it. 
george," Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. 
              His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked 
              it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way 
              or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres. "
farkus," That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion 
              for brassieres. "
george," They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups 
              in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it? "
farkus," Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, 
              that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont. "
george," Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed. "
farkus, See you monday 9 o'clock. 
george," If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8. "
farkus, Excellent. 
george," So long, Mr. Farkus. "
george," Oh, nothing... "
farkus," Yes, Ms. De Granmont? "
farkus," This is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. He's supposed 
              to start on monday. "
elaine," You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman? "
lippman," I was just going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand 
              you worked with him very closely. "
elaine," Yes, krhm, yes I did. "
lippman," And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there 
              seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. "
elaine," Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and 
              intensity. "
lippman," Oh, ""It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided 
              to put on my sweatshirt!"" "
elaine," Right, well... "
lippman, You put exclamation point after sweatshirt? 
elaine," That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't 
              like to be ch-ch-chilly... "
lippman," I see, ""I pulled the lever on the machine, but the 
              Clark bar didn't come out!"" Exclamation point? "
elaine," Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you 
              keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt* 
              nothing comes out... "
lippman, Get rid of the exclamation points... 
elaine," Ok, ok ok ... "
lippman, I hate exclamation points... 
elaine, ...ok I'll just.... 
jerry," 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination 
              of our relationship effective immediately.' "
kramer, Exclamation point. 
elaine, You still have no proof. 
kramer," Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. "
jerry," 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later 
              than the 18th'. "
kramer, Double exclamation point! 
newman, Will that take care of ours too? 
jerry," Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back. 
            "
newman," Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway. 
            "
jerry," Yeah, thanks. "
newman, It'll be my pleasure. 
newman, See'ya later. 
jerry, You know this... 
kramer," Hey, Ralph. "
jerry, Hi Ralph. 
ralph," What's up fellows? That'll be 14,30. "
jerry, All right. 
kramer," Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry? "
jerry, Yeah. 
kramer, What's the matter? You've got a cold? 
ralph," No Kramer, what is this? "
kramer, It's a sweater. 
ralph, What's it made out of? 
kramer," I don't know, Jerry gave it to me. "
jerry," Mohair, I think. "
ralph," Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair. "
jerry, You mean you just started sniffing? 
ralph," Yeah, mohair does it to me every time. "
jerry," I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry 
              came in. "
kramer," Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar. "
elaine," The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he 
              wasn't a drug addict. "
jerry," Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all 
              over it! "
kramer, Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. 
jerry, The what?? 
newman, After you. 
woman, Thank you. 
woman, Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! 
frank," What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your 
              fingers like this? "
george," So what, what is so bad about that? "
estelle," Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be 
              gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity! "
frank," What ever happened to ""Why, that's a lovely dress you 
              have on. May I have this dance?""!! "
elaine, You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. 
jerry," Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 
            "
elaine, What is this? 
jerry, It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. 
elaine," He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why 
              is he filing a chapter eleven? "
jerry," Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and 
              spent it on drugs! "
elaine," What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater. "
kramer," All right, What about the money? "
jerry," What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship 
              with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the 
              money back. Which I"
newman," Pair of bear claws, please. "
woman, Nice. 
jerry, Think so? 
woman," Yeah, what is it? "
jerry," Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?

jerry," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. 
              Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that 
              we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't 
              see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the 
              players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy 
              scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two 
              points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll 
              be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, 
              shh."""
jerry, Are these seats unbelievable or what?
george, Where's the sunblock?
jerry, Here.
george, 25? You don't have anything higher?
jerry," What, are you on Mercury?"
george," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
jerry, You got a problem with paba?
george," Yes, I have a problem with paba."
jerry, You don't even know what paba is.
george, I know enough to stay away from it.
george, So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
jerry, I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
george, Gwen really wants to go.
jerry, You're bringing a date to a party?
george, No good?
jerry," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're 
              with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and 
              talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate.  
              Ho, ho, ho."
george," Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk 
              to?"
jerry," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross 
              dressing. Seems like an interesting guy."
george," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. 
              Todd introduced us, I'm obligated."
jerry, That woman is absolutely stunning.
george, The Croat? 
jerry," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful 
              lineswoman I've ever seen."
george," Yeah, she's a B.L."
jerry, B.L.?
george," Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession 
              stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry?  Jerry?"
coworker," You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out."
elaine, You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
coworker, Take a car service. We have an account.
elaine," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver 
              will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem 
              he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
              always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that 
              would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, 
              and the driver is way up there on the stage. "
coworker," Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in 
              the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down."
elaine, I guess that could work.
announcer," And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming 
              up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a 
              look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop."
kramer," Hey, hey, it's George."
announcer," Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can 
              cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's 
              called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more..."

elaine, Yeah.

              you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, 
              but not me. You know what I do? "
elaine," You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back 
              here. So..."
driver,"  I said you know what I do  
              when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?"
elaine, I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
driver, Going deaf?
elaine, What?
driver, Oh I'm sorry.
elaine, It can be very frustrating.
driver, Hey what about a hearing aid?
elaine," An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know 
              you gotta live your life."
driver," No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. "
jerry," I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman 
              is absolutely mesmerizing."
george, Boy you are really smitten.
jerry, I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
george," Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those 
              guys."
jerry," I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that 
              just walk across the hot coals."
george," They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the 
              other side."
jerry, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
george," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you 
              go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here 
              on this side. Take me with you."
jerry, I can't.
george, What are you going to say?
jerry," I don't know, ""Hi""."
george," You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? 
              You're not going to make it."
radio, Base to 92 come in
driver, Yes this is 92
radio, After this go back to city for a 600 pickup
driver, Righteo
radio, 794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.
elaine," Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love 
              him."
driver, So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
elaine, Yeah. Yes it does...
driver," Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole 
              thing up. "
elaine," No no, no no."
driver," Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation 
              with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. 
              But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is 
              truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted 
              by your behavior."
jerry," Excuse me.  Excuse me?  Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. 
              Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've 
              got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too 
              good for everyone, but it's women like you  oh well, what are you deaf?"
laura, Bingo.
kramer, And you're saying she's deaf.
jerry," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf."
kramer, Can't hear a thing.
jerry, Can't hear a thing.
kramer, And you're going to go out with her.
jerry," Yeah, isn't that something?"
elaine, Hey.
kramer, Hey I know how to sign. 
jerry, Really?
kramer," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us 
              for about a year.  So I haven't been able 
              to do it in a while."
elaine, What is this about?
jerry, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
elaine," You are kidding. That is amazing.  I just took a car service from work and 
              to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf."
jerry, Wow good plan.
elaine," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, 
              but I'm not a terrible person."
elaine," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get 
              out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to 
              injure them like other people. "
jerry, That's nice.
elaine," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever 
              stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because 
              I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."
jerry, That's nice for the freaks.
elaine," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie 
              so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy 
              or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?"
jerry," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about 
              that friend of yours that works at the ticket area."
kramer," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. 
              Like a rock concert. Whatever you like."
elaine," Oh, thanks Kramer."
kramer," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you 
              see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. 
              I would love to be able to do that."
jerry," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key 
              aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There 
              are no ball men."
elaine, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
kramer, Well there ought to be ball men.
jerry," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man 
              go ahead, break the ball barrier."
elaine," Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw 
              George at the tennis match on TV yesterday."
kramer," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating 
              a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing 
              that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real 
              nice and tight. And he's... "
gwen, I'm sorry George.
george," I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? 
              Something must have happened."
gwen," It's not you, it's me."
george," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells 
              me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
gwen," All right, George, it's you."
george, You're *damn* right it's me.
gwen, I was just trying to...
george," I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better 
              than me."
gwen, I'm sure you do it very well.
george," Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find 
              out."
jerry, But I thought things were going great.
george, Yeah so did I.
jerry, Did she say why?
george," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine."
jerry, But that's your routine.
george, Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
kramer," Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday."
george, Really? At the tennis match?
kramer, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
george, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
kramer," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they 
              made a couple of cracks about you."
george, Cracks? What were they saying?
kramer," That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking 
              about how funny you looked."
george, Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
kramer, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
george, She must have seen me eating it on TV.
jerry," So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends 
              it? You really think she would be that superficial?"
george, Why not. I would be.
jerry," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice 
              cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. "
george, You're parents saw me on TV?
jerry, Yeah.
george, This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
kramer, It felt like 8 seconds.
george," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
elaine," I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape 
              it?"
george, Can we move on?
jerry," He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating 
              the ice cream on TV."
elaine, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
george, Yes I do.
elaine, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
george," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there."
kramer, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
jerry," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral 
              place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? "
kramer, Excellent question.
jerry," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the 
              breakee. He needs to get on with his life."
elaine, I beg to differ.
jerry, Really.
elaine," He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong 
              the spoils."
jerry," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want 
              to fight that traffic on Friday night."
elaine, Well we can take the car service from my office.
jerry, Really?
elaine," Yeah, they don't know."
kramer," All right, I'll see you later."
jerry, Okay.
george," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you 
              going to do tonight?"
jerry, Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
george, Oh. 
jerry," Why?  Well what 
              are you doing?"
george," Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want 
              to tag along with you or anything."
jerry," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?"
george," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh,  
              where would we be going?"
george," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no 
              napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that 
              concession stand cost me a relationship."
laura, They never have napkins there.
jerry," Let's get the check.  Is this considered 
              signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know 
              a sign, that's my first sign."
laura," Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up."
george, They're breaking up? How do you know?
jerry, She reads lips.
george, What are they saying now?
laura," ""It's not you, it's me."""
george,"  Oh my gosh, I just 
              had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read 
              Gwen's lips for me."
jerry,  What?
george,"  We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen 
              is saying about me."
jerry,"  She's not a novelty act, 
              George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas."
george,"  Look. It's 
              a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off."
jerry,"  I don't know George. I'm 
              not sure about this."
george,"  Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case 
              closed."
jerry,  All right.
jerry," Uh Laura, George was wondering if..."
laura, Sure. I'll do it.
jerry, So I really had a good time.
laura," Yeah, me too."
jerry, So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
laura, Yeah.
jerry," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by 
              and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. 
              . You got a problem with six? . What? What? "
man," Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've 
              only got two spots to fill. Good luck."
boy," Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight 
              years?"
kramer," I may be old, but I'm spry."
boy," The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up 
              for it?"
kramer, Oh I'll be up for it punk.
jerry," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying 
              ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though."
george," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?"
jerry, Yeah.
george," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" 
              then how is she going to lip read from across the room?"
jerry," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close."
george," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and 
              ""eh""."
jerry, Eh.
george, It seems like a problem.
jerry, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
kramer, Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
jerry, You're kidding.
kramer," Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls 
              with such gusto."
george, When is that car service comming?
jerry," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're 
              going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there."
george," If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how 
              incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your 
              friend."
jerry, I know. It's like X-ray vision.
george," If we could just harness this power and use it for our 
              own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
newman," I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You 
              gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day."
jerry, Can't do it Newman.
newman," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post 
              office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about 
              me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me 
              two hours."
jerry, Not going to happen.
newman,"  All right, all right. All right you go ahead. 
              You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you 
              control the mail, you control... information."
jerry, Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
jerry, I said pull over by the stop sign.
driver," I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a 
              damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. 
              My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. 
              Metalla-something."
kramer, -ca.
driver, Huh?
george, What?
jerry, ca.
george, ah.
driver, My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
driver, Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
jerry," You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so 
              I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night."
jerry," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs,  check, and  late. Hey this is the 
              guy you helped become the first ball man."
kramer, She doesn't know what she's talking about.
todd, Guys you made it.
george, Hey hey.
todd, Sorry to hear about Gwen.
george," Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up 
              with me?"
todd," Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk 
              to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray 
              her confidence by telling you anything."
george," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You 
              should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll 
              even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no 
              chance of me overhearing anything."
todd, You are so centered.
george,"  Let's go, let's go. All right what are 
              they saying?"
kramer," ""Hi Gwen, hi tide."""
jerry, Hi tide?
kramer, Hi Todd.
kramer," ""You've got something between your teeth"""
george, What?
kramer," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love 
              carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea 
              soup."" So do I."
elaine," She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow 
              afternoon?"
jerry, No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
gwen, I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
todd," Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we 
              can sweep together."
kramer," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."""
george, What?
kramer," ""You want me to sleep with you?"""
todd, I don't want to sweep alone.
kramer," He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, 
              oh boy, ""love to."""
george," So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are 
              going to sleep together?"
gwen, What? You're crazy.
kramer," ""What? You're crazy."""
george, I heard your whole conversation.
gwen, How?
kramer," ""How?"""
george,"  I can read lips. You said let's 
              sleep together."
gwen," No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, 
              you know with a broom. Cleaning up."
kramer," ""... with a broom, cleaning up."""
george, Sweep?
gwen, Yes sweep.
kramer," ""Yes sweep."""
george, Cut it.
kramer," George says ""Cut it."""
george, Cut it.
kramer," George is saying ""Cut it."""
george," Cut it.   Would you stop 
              signing? She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep 
              together."""
kramer, I know how to sign.
george," Ow. My eye, my eye."
elaine," It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in 
              the finals."
jerry, I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
jerry, Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
laura, Yep.
driver," Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't 
              that something."
driver," Oh.

"
cast,
george, Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
george, I enjoy understanding.
secretary, Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.
george, I want you to have this job. Of course...
jerry, Yeah?
george, That's it.
jerry, What do you mean that's it?
george," He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was 
              the end of the interview."
jerry," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said?"
george," Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check 
              with my associates."""
elaine," ""I want you to have this job, of course the Board 
              of Directors is under indictment and will be"
jerry," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a 
              prerequisite."""
george, All right.
elaine, Why don't you go ahead and call him?
george," Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything 
              immediately. That's what"
jerry," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose 
              the job."
george, And if I don't call...
jerry," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind 
              of company is it?"
george, Rest stop supply.
kramer," Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey."
jerry, Shower?
kramer, Haircut.
jerry, Who'd you use? Gino?
kramer, Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
elaine, What butcher?
kramer, The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
jerry," Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. 
              I'd hurt his feelings."
elaine, You never get good haircuts.
kramer," You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's 
              there all by himself."
jerry, Really?
elaine," Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one 
              to look good for my bachelor"
kramer, What bachelor auction?
elaine," Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors 
              for charity."
kramer," And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money 
              to cure polio."
jerry, I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
kramer, Polio?
elaine, Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
jerry, Okay.
kramer, What are you all dressed up for?
george, I had a job interview.
kramer, Yeah. How'd it go?
george, Good. Of course...
enzo, Oh Jerry.
jerry, Oh hi Enzo.
enzo," Oh, you've come for the haircut."
jerry," No, actually I was just..."
enzo," It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're 
              my favorite customer. You've been "
jerry," Well I, if it's your day off I really... "
enzo,"  Eh, what's the difference."
jerry, Well I don't want to take too much off.
enzo," Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair."
man," Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best 
              haircut I've ever had."
george, He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.
jerry, What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
george," You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this 
              relationship."
jerry," I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. 
              Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd"
george, You gotta do it.
jerry," I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart."
kramer, No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
jerry, He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.
kramer, So what?
jerry, I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
kramer," His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying 
              yourself. I'm not going to let "
jerry, No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
kramer," I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're 
              going to get that haircut fixed up."
jerry, I don't want you to call him.
kramer," All right, geez. You're crazy."
george, So I still haven't heard about that job.
jerry," Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about 
              that?"
george, I have an idea.
jerry, Yeah?
george, I show up.
jerry, What do you mean you show up?
george," I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. 
              If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't"
jerry, Hmm. Not bad.

mike," Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down 
              the hall there and a small one over here."
george," Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just 
              take the small office."

gino, Nothing. It's just hair.
enzo, You do haircut in the apartment?
gino, No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
enzo, It looks very familiar.
jerry," In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really 
              good."
kramer," Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it."
jerry, Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
kramer," Yeah, so?"
jerry, I think he knew.
kramer, No. He doesn't know.
jerry, Who do you know? He knows my hair.
kramer," Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a 
              thing. Now come on. Pull yourself "

kramer, Whatever it takes.
enzo," See, now Newman is a good customer."
newman," Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to

elaine, Ill be right back.
doctor," Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?"
elaine," Its right down here to the left. I will meet you 
              right back here."
jerry," Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need 
              the tube "
doctor,"  ""Fungicide""? Fungus?"
kramer, You dont?
kramer, Yeah yeah.
george, Well I didnt do it for my mother.
george, Latvia?
george," Enjoy, enjoy."
george, Id like a doggie bag for this please.
kramer, he asked me
elaine," here, take it"
elaine," Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February."
jerry, I once got Happy new Year in July.
elaine, It's 
jerry," It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?"
elaine, It's really cold.
jerry, Scary cold.
elaine, I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
jerry, That.
elaine," Huh, What is that, ha?"
george, What?
jerry, When did you get that?
george," This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. 
        You know about Gore-Tex?"
jerry," You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?"
elaine, You can't even turn around in that thing.
jerry, Look at this 
elaine," Hey George, can you feel this? "
george," All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go."
elaine," Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine 
        or something."
george, What for?
elaine, These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
george," Why?<br/>
        ELAINE Because it's rude, otherwise."
george," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?"
elaine, Yeah.
george," So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're 
        going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?"
jerry, The fabric of society is very complex George.
george, I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
elaine, You can't bring Pepsi.
george, Why not?
elaine, Because we're adults?
george," You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine 
        is better than Pepsi."
jerry," I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there 
        and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table."
george," I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner 
        invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it."
jerry," You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself."
kramer," All right, let's go. Who's driving?"
jerry, You are. I can't get that thing  in my car.
jerry," Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm 
        cold. Give me a squeeze."
elaine, Get off of me. Get off of ME!
jerry, You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?
george," Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat."
elaine," I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one 
        bottle of wine."
george," Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice 
        sectional."
elaine, We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?
george, Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?
elaine," Ring Dings?<br/>
        GEORGE Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a 
        bakery."
kramer, I like Ring Dings.
elaine," George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and 
        Pepsi."
kramer, HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON!
george," It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show 
        up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People 
        be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about 
        the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais 
        and Chardonnay . . . "
elaine," Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. 
        Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is"
jerry, Jerry.
elaine," Yeah, Jerry, come with me."
kramer," Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here 
        in ten minutes."
elaine, Yeah.
kramer, All right
elaine," Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries."
jerry," Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and 
        white. Two races of flavor living side by side  It's a wonderful 
        thing isn't it?"
elaine, You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
jerry, I'm looking forward to it.
elaine, Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
jerry," Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'? 
      "
elaine, CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty.
jerry, Love that Bobka.
elaine," Yeah, yeah!"
jerry," So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the 
        cake box."
elaine, Why?
jerry," I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the 
        little string."
elaine, You think it's effeminate? 
jerry, It's a tad dainty.
elaine," Oh, we forgot to pick a number."
jerry, You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.
elaine, You think I should go ask her for hers?
jerry," No, forget it."
elaine," No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't 
        mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and 
        them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me."
kramer," Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?<br/>
        GEORGE Just double park"
kramer, No
george, Why not?
kramer," I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out 
        of here?"
george," Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give 
        them up. "
kramer, It's a fallacy.
george," All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store 
        and I'll wait in the car? "
kramer, Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
george," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get 
        cold. "
kramer," So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll 
        be on."
george, Does the heater even work in this car?
kramer, No.
george," Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see"
kramer, I see.
george," You see, ho ho, "
elaine, But we were here ahead of you.
barbara, How do I know that?
jerry, Well we saw you come in.
yyy," Well, that's easy for you to say."
elaine," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I 
        make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries."
clerk, 46?
elaine," Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?"
barbara, Yes.
elaine," Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember 
        we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower."
barbara, I'm on my way over there right now.
elaine, Me too.
d," You're Jerry right?<br/>
        JERRY David!"
elaine," Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?"
barbara, Yes it is.
elaine, You know we were here ahead of you.
barbara, You're NOT getting my number.
jerry, Oh so you still don't believe us.
clerk, 47!
barbara, Us.
elaine," Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are."
barbara," Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what 
        a jerk YOU are. . . . I'll have the chocolate Bobka."
clerk, You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
george," So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!"
kramer, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
george, What's that?
kramer," It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which 
        is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars."
george," Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee 
        you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake."
kramer," All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't 
        have my wallet."
george, . . . Why not?
kramer," Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's 
        bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter "
george," ""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? 
      "
kramer, I never take it.
george, So what do you do?
kramer," Oh, I get by."
barbara, See you later 
elaine, /JERRY See you later.
jerry, That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.
elaine, I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.
jerry, That was our Bobka.
elaine, You can't beat a Bobka.
jerry, We should have had that Bobka.
elaine, They're going to be heroes. 
jerry," What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole 
        thing's useless."
elaine, Well how about a carrot cake?
jerry," Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into 
        a cake. I'm sorry."
elaine, Black Forrest? 
jerry," Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh."
jerry, How about a Napoleon? 
elaine," Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. 
        Might as well get Mengle. "
jerry, That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!
elaine, What's this one?
clerk, That's cinnamon Bobka.
jerry, Another Bobka?
clerk, There's chocolate and there's cinnamon. 
jerry," Well, we've got to get the cinnamon."
elaine," No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser 
        Bobka."
jerry," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People 
        love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and 
        pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" 
        The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. 
        Lesser Bobka - I think not."
clerk, 49?
elaine, I'll have the cinnamon Bobka. 
jerry,"  and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!"
cleck, That will be 13.05
george, All right here you go.
clerk, A hundred? I can't change that.
george, You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go.
kramer, Wait a second. I can get change.
kramer," Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?"
george," Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed."
kramer, What?
george," Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be 
        jumping out of windows after us."
kramer, Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
george, I am not buying something just to get change.
kramer," George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on."
kramer, All rright let's get some gum or something.
george," Pack of gum, okay here you go."
clerk, What I this a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
george, Why not?
clerk, You got to buy more than that.
kramer," Here, get a newspaper."
george, A newspaper.
clerk, That's not enough.
kramer, A Clark Bar.
george, Clark Bar.
clerk, Keep going.
george, There's 22 dollars here.
kramer," George, George, Get a Penthouse Forum."
george, I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
kramer," That will make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the 
        letters at the dinner table."
george," Oh, that's nice."
kramer," Hey, did you ever read one of these?"
george, It's not real. They're all made up.
kramer," Oh, it's real."
george," You know there is an unusual number of people in this country 
        having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark 
        Bar."
clerk, 6.75.
george," Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now."
man1, 
george," Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex."
kramer, You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war. 
jerry," Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, 
        is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes 
        better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes 
        us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be 
        solved. "
elaine," Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should 
        do an op-ed piece for the Times. "
jerry," Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie."
elaine, What is this? 
jerry, What?
elaine, It's a hair.
jerry," Oh, take it back. Let's get another one."
elaine," No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off."
jerry," No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second."
elaine, Excuse me.
man," Hey hey, I'm in line here."
elaine," No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake 
        with a hair on it. "
clerk, You have to take a number.
elaine," We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH 
        A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing  are you going to wait here?"
jerry," Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it."
elaine, It was a little hair. I took it off.
jerry, A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
elaine, What if it's your hair?
jerry, What if it's your hair?
elaine," What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care 
        of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head."
jerry," Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health 
        food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your 
        roots out."
elaine," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number."
jerry," Well, why don't we just forget about the cake? "
elaine, No I'm bringing cake!
george," All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine 
        if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S 
        YOUR WINE? GET OUT! "
kramer," ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but 
        every word of this story is true""  "" 
        A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive 
        our new neighbor Linda was"""
george," Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES 
        ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. 
        Can you believe this?"
kramer," ""well of course I noticed it too with those ample 
        breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock 
        out."""
george," I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. 
        Can you comprehend it?"
kramer," No, no I can't comprehend it?<br/>
        GEORGE I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're basically still 
        very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys who 
        built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?"
kramer," Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking 
        and blocking somebody in."
george," So you really understand my point about building a rocket and 
        double-parking."
kramer," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part 
        he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?"
george," Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard 
        for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini 
        would circle the block six times looking for a spot?"
kramer, How about Idi Amin?
george," Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the 
        death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is 
        not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!"
kramer, Are those shoes comfortable?
george, No not really.
kramer, They look comfortable.
george, I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.
elaine, Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?
jerry," No, out of the question."
elaine, Why?
jerry, Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
elaine, What happened?
jerry, I'd rather not talk about it.
elaine, You can't tell me?
jerry, All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
elaine, You found a hair in your Farina?
jerry," Yeah,"
elaine, What happened?
jerry," I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's 
        a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running 
        and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running 
        and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site."
elaine," Wow. Who's hair was it?<br/>
        JERRY My mother's."
clerk, 68!
elaine, That's us.
jerry," Oh, good."
elaine, You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.
clerk,  
jerry," Ah, that's lovely."
elaine," Ah,"
jerry," Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your 
        hair for some phlegm "
clerk, Here you are.
elaine," Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?"
kramer, HEY DOUBLE-PARKER. SOVIET SCUM. COME ON OUT. IT'S FREEZING!
george, We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
kramer, Why?
george," You know, Elaine."
kramer, What about her?
george, . . . I'm a little scared of her. 
kramer, You're scared of Elaine?
george, Yes!
kramer, Why?
george," Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because 
        I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard 
        my head came right through the top of it."
kramer, Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.
george," Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?<br/>
        KRAMER Because I wanted to look good for the party."
george," Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty 
        minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?"
man2, Back off puff ball it's not my car! 
george, I wasn't talking to you.
elaine," Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that 
        big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember 
        that Panama hat? That was nothing."
jerry," Uh, wa?"
elaine, What's the matter with you?
jerry," Uh, I don't feel so good."
elaine, What's wrong?
jerry," My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie."
elaine, The black and white?
jerry, Yeah.
elaine, Not getting along?
jerry, I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.
elaine, Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
jerry, I feel like I'm going to throw up.
elaine," Hey, what about your vomit streak?"
jerry," I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980."
elaine," Oh, oh!"
man3, Sooory.
elaine," Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're 
        doing you, LUNATIC! uh, I think he broke my toe.  
        Where're you going?"
jerry, Fourteen years down the drain.
george, Do chickens have individual personalities?
kramer,  I don't care.
george," If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the 
        way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? 
        Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should 
        be eating them. What's the matter with you?"
clerk, Can I help you guys with anything?
george," We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some 
        car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out."
clerk," Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. But my friend here has 
        hypothermia."
kramer, I've got hypothermia.
clerk," All right guys, take it outside."
clerk, You're paying for these.
elaine, How was it?
jerry, As good as it gets.
george," You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot 
        more than that cheap Chardonnay."
kramer, I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking. 
george," I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car. 
      "
george," Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein."
man4," Don't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch 
        your death of cold. So long. "
clerk, Can I get you anything else?
jerry," Oh, no thanks. "
clerk," How about a nice box of ""scram""."
george," Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been 
        Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. 
        What, what happened to you? "
elaine," Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to 
        put up your ."
jerry," Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are 
        you drunk? "
george, I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
jerry, What for?
george, I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?
elaine, Cinnamon Bobka.
george, Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?
jerry, George!
elaine," Here, here's your cake."
george, And your wine.
elaine, See ya'.
jerry, See ya'.

jerry," Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years I've had this T-shirts,

elaine, I'm on the phone here.
jerry," Golden Boy is always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry, 
              here"
elaine," No thanks. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold."
jerry," But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy 
              is slowly "
elaine," Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with 
              some "
jerry," No!!! The reason he's iron man is because he goes out there 
              and plays"
elaine," Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! this is so fantastic! 
              I'm"
jerry, The guy in the gulag!
elaine," Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working 
              on it! "
jerry, You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
elaine," Oh! Don't you know what this means, it's like working with 
              Tolstoy!"
jerry," Hey ya know what I read the most unbelievable thing about 
              Tolstoy the"
elaine, Ha ha.
jerry," No, no.. I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress 
              didn't like "
elaine, But it's a line from that song!
jerry, That's were they got it from!
elaine, Really?
jerry, I'm not joking!
george, You can't handle the truth!
jerry, What?
george," I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the 
              truth!(he "
elaine," What, is this your mail? (She takes the mail and starts 
              flipping"
george," Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't want my mother reading 
              it."
elaine, Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
jerry, Your mother reads your mail?
george, Yeah.
jerry, What do you mean like post-cards?
george," No, anything."
jerry, She doesn't open?
george, She'll open!
jerry, You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
george, Yeah.
jerry, What did she say?
george, I was curious! 
jerry, Isn't that against the law?
george, Maybe I can get her locked up.
elaine,"  Hey Jerry, you're in the 
              Alumni "
jerry, He can't handle the truth!
elaine, All right.. this is too fun I gotta get back to work.
kramer," Ah, maybe you could use this  
              Ah,"
kramer," Yeah you know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments,            "
elaine, Wow!

kramer," Well, what did you do next?"
george," Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed 
              like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down 
              on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!"
kramer, What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.
jerry, Well the crowd most have gone wild!
george," Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like 
              Rocky 1. "

"
 ,
george, Did she say why? 
jerry," No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head 
        like this <i></i> "
george, Maybe she's diabetic. 
jerry, No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. 
george, Maybe you said something that offended her. 
jerry," The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those 
        moving walkways all over the city. "
george, Like at the airport? <i></i> 
jerry, Yeah. 
george, That's a great idea!!! 
jerry, Tell me about it! 
george, We could be zipping all over the place. 
jerry, They could at least try it. 
george, They never try anything. 
jerry, What's the harm? 
george, No harm! 
jerry," <i></i> I'm sorry. There's no reason 
        for her not to taste that pie. "
elaine, Who wouldn't taste a pie? 
jerry, Audrey. 
elaine, Dump her. 
jerry," Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? "
elaine," <i></i> I once broke up with someone for not offering 
        me pie. "
jerry, You did? 
elaine," He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's 
        a sickness. "
george," Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there 
        were walkways. <i></i> What are you doing? 
      "
elaine, I got a pebble.

kramer," Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. <i></i>
"
elaine, What? Why? 
kramer, Do it. Do it. This. 
elaine, Like... <i></i> Like this? 
kramer, Oh yeah! It's you! 
elaine, What's me? 
kramer," <i></i> There's a clothing store downtown. They 
        got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. "
elaine, Get out! 
kramer," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, 
        dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you 
        on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. "
george," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? "
kramer, Rinitze. <i></i> Oh yeah... 
jerry, <i></i> Uh... may I help you? <i></i> 
kramer," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one 
        my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it. "
george," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits 
        in there? "
kramer, Real Boss! 
elaine, I'm going down there. 
george," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second 
        interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking 
        me out to lunch on Friday. "
elaine," <i></i> Let's go. 
      "
george, All right. All right. <i></i> 
kramer," <i></i> Are you gonna need this? 
      "
jerry, Keep it. <i></i> 
 ,
elaine, It looks exactly like me. 
george," It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. 
        Don't fall asleep Elaine. "
elaine, What's going on here? How do you think this happened? 
george," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? "
elaine," You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? 
      "
saleswoman, <i></i> You are perfect for that suit. 
george, You think so? 
elaine," <i></i> Excuse me. Where did this come from? 
      "
saleswoman, I don't know. 
george, You really think this looks O.K. on me? 
saleswoman, Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have. 
elaine, I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? 
saleswoman," I told you, I don't know. "
elaine," <i></i> Well, is there somebody 
        around here I could talk to who would know? "
saleswoman, Why? 
elaine, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. 
elaine," <i></i> Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let 
        me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is 
        me at him about you. "
saleswoman," I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein 
        is wearing a 1200$ Gaultier dress. "
elaine," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous 
        dress? <i></i> Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be 
        caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. <i></i> 
        I'll meet you outside. "
saleswoman, What is her problem? 
george," Pfft! What can you do? <i></i> 
        Is this the price tag? "
saleswoman, Yes. 
george," Yes, hello. Party's over. <i></i> "
saleswoman," I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised 
        sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price. "
george, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? 
saleswoman," Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to 
        the other customers. "
george," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. <i></i> "
 ,
elaine," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em 
        up. "
kramer, How did they get your face? 
elaine," I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. <i></i> Jerry? Je... 
        Hello? "
jerry," <i></i> Uh... Excuse 
        me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. "
jerry, And you waved it away. 
jerry, Did you give her a reason? 
jerry," You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your 
        head. "
jerry," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank 
        you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. <i></i> Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. "
elaine, We certainly have. 
kramer," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. "
elaine, No way! 
kramer," Come on, one lap around. "
elaine, No. 
kramer, It will be a funky adventure. 
elaine," Kramer, forget it. "
kramer," Jerry, how about you? "
jerry, I think you know my policy. 
kramer, I'm going home to spatula. <i></i> 
elaine, I thought George was meeting us here? 
jerry, No he's going downtown to guard the suit. 
elaine, He's guarding a suit? 
kramer," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. <i></i> Whoa. "
olive, Turn around. 
kramer," Oh, all right. <i></i> "
 ,
saleswoman, <i></i> It fits you perfectly. 
bob, You think so? <i></i> 
george," <i></i> What's this? Can't I leave this place for a 
        second? <i></i> Can I help you? "
bob, I'm buying the suit. 
george," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. <i></i> "
bob," Excuse me, do you work here? "
george, <i></i> No. 
bob, Then what the hell business is it of yours? 
george," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. 
        This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. "
bob, Really? This Monday? 
george, Yes. Now take off those pants. 
saleswoman," Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday. "
bob," Friday? Thanks. <i></i>
"
george," <i></i> You know honey for an unadvertised 
        sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. "
 ,
jerry," I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts 
        here? "
audrey, Everything is delicious. 
jerry, You've tasted them? 
audrey," Um-hmm, I think almost all of them. "
jerry, Oh I see they have apple pie. 
audrey, Mmm-hmm. 
jerry, You've had the apple pie? 
audrey, Many times. 
jerry," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's 
        my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other 
        day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts 
        in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such 
        a thing would prey on my mind. "
audrey, Can we drop this? 
jerry, <i></i> Why can't I know? 
audrey, Ah! Poppie. 
poppie," Sweetheart, hello. "
audrey," Poppie, this is Jerry. "
poppie, Welcome <i></i> 
jerry, Hello Poppie. 
poppie," Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. 
        Very special. <i></i> "
jerry," The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. <i></i>
"
poppie," Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going 
        to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey. "
audrey, Jerry are you OK? 
jerry, Huh? 
audrey, Is anything wrong? 
jerry," No, Nothing. "
audrey, You look like you've seen a ghost.

olive, Thank you. 
kramer, Ohh!

      "
poppie, <i></i> Well? 
audrey, Jerry have some. 
audrey, You're not gonna taste it? 
audrey, Jerry. 
 ,
jerry, So she tought I did it to get back at her 
george, Why didn't you just tell her? 
jerry," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your 
        father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was 
        kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. "
george, How could he not have washed? 
jerry," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. 
        Turn the water on, do something. "
george," Yeah, just like I do. "
jerry," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's 
        a cry for help, he wants to get caught. "
george," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other 
        thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti? "
jerry, We haven't spoken. 
kramer," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. <i></i> "
george, Olive? 
kramer," Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the 
        way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. 
        The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all 
        where anything can happen. "
george," I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty 
        minutes. "
kramer, Is that Elaine mannequin still there? 
george," Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked. "
jerry," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... "
 ,
bob, Where is it? Where is it? 
george," <i></i> Well, 
        look at this. <i></i> This doesn't belong here! Someone has 
        made a terrible mistake. "
bob, You bastard! You hid the suit. 
george," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, 
        I do believe I shall purchase it. "
bob," I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't 
        know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay! "
george," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. "
 ,
elaine," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. 
        You know, possible suspects. "
jerry," Yeah, all right. Go ahead. <i></i> "
elaine," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face 
        for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost 
        put his finger up my nose. "
jerry," Hum... ok, what else you got? "
elaine," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. "
jerry," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? "
elaine, Because you have an attitude. 
jerry, Georgio! Nice duds! 
george," You're telling me. <i></i> So, what do you think? "
jerry, Did you hear something? 
elaine," Yeah, like a swoosh. "
jerry, Yeah. 
elaine," It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you 
        walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. "
george," I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street 
        noise. <i></i> This is no good! I got to meet these guys from 
        MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! "
jerry, So what? What would they care? 
george," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired 
        the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. "
jerry," So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make 
        a noise? "
george," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice 
        quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's 
        gonna hire? "
jerry," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. "
kramer," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. "
jerry, Audrey? 
kramer," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. "
jerry, Was it apple? 
kramer, What else? 
jerry, This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! 
stranger, Do I know you? 
elaine, Hmm... No you don't. 
stranger," Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with 
        points. "
elaine, The mannequin! 
jerry," Oh, I got to see this thing. "
 ,
jerry," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. "
elaine," You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in 
        your window! "
saleswoman," It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want 
        with it. "
elaine," No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. 
        <i></i> Yes, this is my attorney. "
saleswoman, <i></i> Yeah? What law am I breaking? 
jerry," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, 
      "
elaine, Uh-huh 
jerry, The Charlie Macarthy hearings. 
elaine, Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? 
saleswoman, I'm getting the manager. <i></i> 
elaine, Jerry get the car. <i></i> 
jerry, What are you doing? 
elaine, Just get the car! 
jerry," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. "
 ,
jerry," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint 
        gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right? "
elaine, Where are you going? 
jerry, Poppie's 
 ,
mackenzie," Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of 
        control, <i></i> phones ringing, people 
        running in and out. <i></i> 
        Did you hear something? "
george," No, I didn't hear anything. "
mackenzie," Huh, that's strange. <i></i> It's 
        quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... <i></i> That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything? 
      "
george," No, can't say as I did. "
mackenzie, Kind of like a... rustling. 
george, Could be the leaves... 
 ,
audrey," That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye. 
      "
jerry, Hello. 
audrey, What are you doing here? 
jerry, So how was the pie? 
audrey, What pie? 
jerry, The apple pie you had today at Monks 
audrey, I'm very busy here. 
jerry," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. "
audrey, You better not let Poppie see you here. 
audrey," Uh, who are you? "
jerry," Oh, about the... uh <i></i> "
poppie, I'm Poppie. 
poppie, What's the problem? 
audrey, What do they want from Poppie? 
jerry," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. "
 ,
mackenzie, You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing? 
george, I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. 
mackenzie," No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. 
        That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team 
        here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, 
        you're in the wrong place. "
george, No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. 
waiter, Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house. 
mackenzie, Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert. 
waiter," <i></i> The chef said that he made it special for 
        you. "
george, Oh... <i></i> 
mackenzie," Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. <i></i> Well, take a bite. It's delicious. 
        <i></i> I insist. <i></i> "
businessman," If you're one of us, you'll take a bite. "
 ,
jerry, So you didn't get the job. 
george," No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently 
        ill. "
jerry," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have 
        to say something. "
kramer, What am I supposed to say? 
jerry, Tell her you lost your itch. 
george, What happened to your itch? 
kramer," I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt 
        her feelings. "
jerry, Well you should tell her. 
kramer," I'll let her down easy. All right. <i></i> Well, hi Olive. <i></i> No, 
        no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you. "
olive, What? 
kramer," Uh, well, there's someone else. "
olive, Someone else? 
kramer," Yeah, yeah, yeah... "
olive, Who is she? 
kramer," Her. <i></i>
"
olive, her? 
kramer," Yeah, there she is. That's my gal. "
olive," You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend. 
      "
kramer," Now Olive, look, I'm sorry. "
olive, Why is she wearing her underwear? 
kramer," Well, it's a style. <i></i> Jerry give me 
        the keys. <i></i> Well, I guess we're 
        gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that. "
george, Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? 
jerry," No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie 
        away for a long long time. "
elaine," You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from 
        a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin 
        that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming 
        from? "
 ,
ricky, TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine. 
toby," A coffee table book about coffee tables! &lt;To Kramer&gt; How 
        did you come up with this idea?"
kramer, It was there!
toby," Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some 
        coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' &lt;laughs&gt;"
elaine," Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so..."
kramer," Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so 
        the book itself becomes a coffee table?"
toby," Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!"
jerry," Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you 
        think this is funny - &lt;reads comedy he's written&gt; ""Men definitely 
        hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only 
        care <i>what else</i> is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before 
        they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."""
jerry," You don't know? Come on, that's gold!"
elaine," Well, I don't know about ""gold."""
jerry," Oh, that's gold, baby."
elaine," 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?"
jerry, I was saying 'baby' way before George!
elaine," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, 
        Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me."
jerry," Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night."
elaine," Yeah, who's he?"
jerry," He's a writer from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. I would like to 
        have a good show."
kramer," Danke schoen, my little dumplings."
elaine, Hi.
elaine," Yeah, how about her?"
kramer," Ooh, she's a package full of energy!"
elaine," Yeah, she's a package full of something."
kramer," And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - 
        she's brimmin' with positivity!"
jerry, Yeah.
kramer," Great, I'm gonna bring Toby."
jerry," Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's 
        gonna be there."
kramer," Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?"
elaine," Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. &lt;imitates Toby&gt; 
        Really, really great!"
kramer, Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
jerry, Yeah.
elaine," What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?"
kramer, She's got a kid?
jerry," Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!"
george," Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat 
        that! That's not food! &lt;to Robin&gt; He's suckin' down Equal packets!"
robin, Do you think 25 kids is too much?
george," 25 kids for his birthday party? &lt;to kid under table&gt; Don't 
        put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, 
        here, have some more sugar packets."
robin," So, what about entertainment? &lt;to kid&gt; Should I get Barney?"
kid, No Barney!
george, How about Bozo?
kid, Who's Bozo?
george," Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a 
        kid, Bozo the Clown was <i>the</i> clown, bar none. "
robin, George...
george," With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles..."
robin, George...
george, And the TV show! He had cartoons!
robin," George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over 
        for Bozo."
george," You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday 
        parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday 
        party..."
<i>frank," Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out 
        the damn candles!</i>"
<i>estelle," Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!</i>"
robin," Well, this time, you can blow out the candles."
george," Nah, I have asthma. &lt;Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under 
        the table, and George struggles.&gt;"
toby, Hi!
toby, How are you doing today?
elaine," Fine... &lt;Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.&gt; How 
        are you?"
toby," Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear 
        about Bob Rosen?"
elaine, Nope.
toby, He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
elaine," Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior 
        editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?"
toby, No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house. 
elaine, Really!
toby, Maybe it'll be you!
elaine, Oh...well...
toby," You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman 
        really respects your opinion..."
toby, No...
elaine," No, really."
toby," Boy, wouldn't that be exciting! "
elaine," I mean, stranger things have happened..."
toby, Wow! Me! A senior editor! &lt;deadly serious&gt; I'd like that.
elaine," Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby."
toby," Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! 
        Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. &lt;Exits.&gt;"
jerry," Hey, Ronnie. &lt;To bartender&gt; Can I have a club soda? &lt;To 
        Ronnie&gt; Goin' on tonight?"
ronnie, Yeah. You?
jerry, Yeah.
ronnie, You know Leonard Christian's here?
jerry," Yeah, I know."
ronnie, Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?
jerry, I don't...think so.
ronnie, Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?
jerry, I don't...I dunno.
ronnie, Is it possible for nostrils to expand? 
jerry," Oh, is this a bit?"
ronnie," Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I 
        can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun."
kramer," Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry."
toby," This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! &lt;To Jerry&gt; 
        Touch! Touch them! &lt;Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.&gt; 
        I've never been to a comedy club before!"
jerry," Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf 
        now, too."
jerry," Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear."
toby," Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. 
        I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! &lt;laughs&gt;"
kramer, What about me?
jerry," Good, good."
jerry," Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?"
toby," Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll 
        be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover 
        charge to stare at your bald spot.' &lt;laughs&gt;"
kramer," Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?"
jerry, Yeah.
toby," Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!"
jerry," O.k., good, I'll see you later. &lt;Kramer and Toby are about 
        to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.&gt;"
toby," Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!"
jerry, Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
jerry," Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care <i>what 
        else</i> is on TV."
toby," Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! &lt;Other audience members give her 
        puzzled looks.&gt;"
toby," Oh, that is so true, yes!"
jerry, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
toby," BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! &lt;Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry 
        to completely lose his place and mess up his act.&gt;"
jerry," Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down 
        here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!"
kramer," Look, she didn't mean anything."
jerry," Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!"
kramer," She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!"
jerry, Hey! What is wrong with you?!
toby, Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
jerry," You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout 
        the whole set!"
toby," Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show."
jerry," No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the 
        show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!"
toby," Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it 
        in this business if you can't take it?"
jerry," Oh, I can take it."
ronnie," Hey, man. Good set."
george, Bozo? 
eric, No.
george, B-O-Z-O? 
eric," Sorry, I..."
george, You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
eric, No!
george, How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
eric," I don't know, I just don't."
george, How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
eric," Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's 
        not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?"
george," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?"
eric," Well, what is he?"
george," Yes, he's a clown!"
eric," Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!"
george," Alright, just forget it."
eric," Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, 
        man! You're hung up on some clown from the <i>sixties</i>, man!"
george," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, 
        Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?"
george," Well, I do what I can. &lt;Robin comes over.&gt;"
robin," Hi Mom, how's everything?"
robin, The burgers should be ready in a minute.
george," Ah, great, great. &lt;sniffs&gt; What's that smell? Smoke? &lt;walks 
        to the kitchen&gt; Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...&lt;smoke 
        boils into the doorway.&gt; FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!"
eric," There he is! That's him! &lt;Tries to clobber George with his big 
        shoe.&gt;"
robin," But you yelled ""get out of my way""!"
george," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is 
        lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should 
        all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where 
        heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?"
robin," But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a 
        mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone 
        behind!"
george," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand 
        how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like 
        knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to 
        the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving 
        anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that 
        exit was clear. Any other questions?"
fireman, How do you live with yourself?
george, Its not easy.
george, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
jerry," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?"
george," No, her too. And her mother."
jerry, Really? Her mother.
george," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know."
jerry, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
george, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
jerry," So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day 
        and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion."
george, To some degree.
jerry," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves."
george, In a manner of speaking.
jerry," Well, it's honest."
george," Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like 
        equals."
jerry," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll 
        see things differently."
george, Perhaps.
jerry," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?"
george, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
jerry," By the way, did you see this? &lt;Hands George a magazine&gt;"
george, What's that?
jerry," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig 
        in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article."
george," Wow, he really does a number on you. &lt;reads&gt; ""Seinfeld 
        froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."""
jerry, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
george," You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and 
        heckle her. "
jerry," Yeah, right."
george," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like 
        it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'"
jerry," Yeah, that'd be something."
george," I'm not kidding, you should do it."
jerry," But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always 
        had a fantasy about doing that."
george," Well, go ahead! Do it!"
jerry, Why can't I?
george, No reason!
jerry," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where 
        I work, I'll go down to where she works!"
george, This is unprecedented!
jerry," There's no precedent, baby!"
george, What...are you using my babies now?
jerry," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice 
        to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to 
        the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, 
        let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'"
toby," You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!"
jerry," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?"
toby," Well, how would you like it if I called security?"
jerry," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this 
        business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!"
kramer," Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!"
kramer, What did you go up there to heckle her for?
jerry," Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste 
        of her own medicine! &lt;George enters.&gt;"
kramer," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright."
jerry," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident."
george, What accident?
kramer," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of 
        the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky 
        toe."
george, That's unbelievable!
kramer," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put 
        it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital."
george, You ran?
kramer," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe 
        here, buddy - step on it."""
george, Holy cow!
kramer," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, 
        I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the 
        seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think 
        you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize 
        for ya, buddy - "" &lt;Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive 
        uppercut&gt; - knocked him out cold!"
george, How could you do that?!
kramer," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed 
        out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him 
        by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and 
        now I'm drivin' the bus."
george, You're Batman.
kramer," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he 
        starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' 
        the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and 
        I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop."
jerry, You kept makin' all the stops?
kramer," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!"
george," Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?"
kramer," Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place 
        at the end of the line."
george, You did all this...for a pinky toe?
kramer," Well, it's a valuable appendage."
joanne," So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it."
elaine, Really.
joanne, Poor kid. What an ordeal.
michael," And you know how extremely sensitive she is...she's gonna need 
        our full support."
michael," Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?"
toby," Oh no, I'll be fine..."
jerry, <i>She</i> got the promotion?
jerry, Why?
elaine," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because 
        Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings."
jerry, Too bad.
elaine," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! 
        It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to 
        cut. What do we need it for?"
jerry," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the 
        home.'"
elaine, Why don't you just shut the f-
elaine," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??"
kramer," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order 
        of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon 
        as possible."
elaine," Oh, wonderful!"
kramer," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile 
        on her face."
elaine," Oh, of course! She's deranged."
jerry," So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and 
        see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to 
        write another article."
ronnie, I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
jerry, Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
ronnie," How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it."
jerry," Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand."
ronnie," Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of 
        us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me."
jerry," Yeah, well, won't be long."
announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!"
jerry, Gotta go. &lt;heads out on stage&gt;
george, Robin? Robin!
robin," George, what is it? I'm working."
george," Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer 
        has opened my eyes. I think I've changed. "
robin, What are you talking about?
george, O.k....&lt;is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.&gt;
jerry," I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need ""the clown"" 
        in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse 
        him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo..."
george," ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give 
        me one more chance. "
robin, Listen...I gotta think about this. &lt;walks away.&gt;
george," Alright, but I'm serious about this."
jerry, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
robin, George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
george," The prop comic? &lt;Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.&gt; 
        Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?"
jerry, George - could I have a word?
kramer," All right, get off at the next exit."
jerry," Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the 
              exit."
kramer," It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there."
jerry,  You sure we're makin' the right move?
elaine," We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a 
              weekend in"
jerry, Didn't they just have a baby?
elaine," That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see 
              the"
jerry," Is it possible they're just having babies to get people 
              to visit"
kramer," Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?"
jerry, No.
kramer, Put that on the top of your list.
jerry," No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and 
              Jane"
elaine," Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex 
              yet, but"
jerry," I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she 
              signed a"
elaine, When's Rachel comin' out?
jerry, She's makin' the three o'clock train.
elaine," Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting 
              you"
jerry, I bought him some kishka.
kramer, What's that?
jerry," It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry 
              it. In"
george, I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
jane, Me too. I love cough medicine.
george," You see? We were made for each other.  
              It's"
jane, What's your favorite?
george, Pertussin. Ever try it with club soda?
jane, No.
george," Oh, very refreshing.  Sex is like joining 
              a"
jane, Are we almost there?
george," Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at 
              a"
jane, What for?
george," My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton 
              tomatoes."
jane, Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
kramer, Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
jerry," Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
kramer," Come on, I'll rub some on yours."
jerry," No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No."
george,"  You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar 
              and"
jane,  You must've been excited.
george," Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You 
              wanna go"
jane, I don't think so.
george," 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?"
jerry, No thanks.
kramer, No. 
jane," I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters"
jerry, And then there's Maude. 
elaine," Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?"
jerry, No lines.
elaine, You know why? One word shade.
jerry," So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous 
              event?"
elaine, I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
kramer," I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, 
              you"
elaine,  No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
jerry,  Oh this is interesting.
elaine, What?
jerry, Jane's topless. 
kramer, Yo yo ma.
jerry, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
elaine, Nice rack. 
carol," Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!"
jerry," Oh, in a minute, Carol."
kramer, We're gonna be right there.
jerry, This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
elaine, Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
kramer, Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
elaine, What?
kramer," You know, get some good word of mouth goin'."
jerry," Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as 
              Jane"
jane, I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
jerry, No thanks.
elaine, I'm good.
kramer," Deh-deh-deh-deh-  All right, show's over. I'm 
              goin'"
carol," Adam , Jerry and Elaine are here."
elaine," Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby."
carol," Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened"
elaine, Ugghh.
carol, Is she gorgeous? 
elaine," Oh, gorgeous, yes."
jerry, So very gorgeous.
carol," Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in."
jerry, Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
elaine," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
jerry," Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. "
elaine," Oh, you have to lie."
jerry, It's a must lie situation.
elaine," Yes, it's a must lie situation."
jerry," You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane 
              topless."
elaine," No, I don't think so."
jerry," You know, we might want to tell Kramer."
ben, Oh this ointment should do it.
carol," How are you feeling, Adam?  
              Elaine!"
elaine, Hi.
carol," Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how 
              gorgeous?"
elaine,  Pretty gorgeous.
ben," Elaine, you have children?"
elaine," Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't 
              wait to"
ben, A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite
elaine, Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
carol," And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?"
ben, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and
jerry," Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station."
elaine," Yeah, see ya."
jerry, Okay. 
carol," Oh, just look at him!"
ben," Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his"
rachel," Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the 
              wrong"
jerry, Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes
george, Hey Rachel!
rachel,"  Hi. I'm gonna go in there to 
              change."
george, What kind of a greeting was that?
jerry, She's got greeting problems.
george," Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em 
              like"
jerry," Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup"
kramer," Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!"
george," Hey! Wow, the K-Man! "
jerry, You got lobster for everybody?
kramer," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
george," This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster 
              for"
kramer," I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows 
              that"
george," You saw who, what?"
kramer," Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her."
jerry,  All right.
george, You saw Jane topless?
jerry," Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless."
george, Oh you mean face down on her chest.
jerry, No.
george, Face up on her back?
jerry, Yeah.
george, Well why'd she do that?
kramer, I guess she was hot.
george, You mean she just laid there topless?
kramer," No, no, she got up, walked around..."
george, Walked around? And you looked?
kramer," Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm 
              gonna go"
george," I can't believe it, you saw her before me."
jerry, Think of me as a doctor. 
george," Well, how good a look did you get?"
jerry, Well what'd you mean?
george," Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her 
              to a police"
jerry, They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
george," Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize 
              her"
jerry, I guess that's true...
george," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't 
              like"
jerry, What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
george," Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime."
jerry, You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
george," It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of 
              Tang and"
elaine, Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
jerry, I've never been called breathtaking either.
elaine," I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then 
              who's not"
jerry, Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
elaine," Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out."
jerry, How are you gonna do that?
elaine, I can be very clever.
rachel, I'm gonna take a swim.
elaine," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and 
              sees"
george," Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their 
              room"
rachel, Hey!
george," Oh, sorry."
rachel, Don't you knock?
george," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've 
              never"
jerry, You might have.
george, I didn't.
jerry, You won't.
rachel," What'd you want anyway, George?"
jerry," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what 
              you"
george," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
jerry," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some 
              gum."
george," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms 
              me up."
rachel, We don't have any gum.
george, Okay.  Thanks anyway. 
rachel, Strange man.
jerry, Wait'll you get to know him.
rachel," So where is this baby, anyway?"
jerry," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything 
              quite so"
rachel,"  Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was 
              the baby's"
george, I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
george, Did she do it on purpose?
jerry," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door."
george, I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
jerry, So what?
george, Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
jerry, But...
george," Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the 
              water was"
jerry, Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
george, Yes. Significant shrinkage!
jerry, So you feel you were short changed.
george," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete"
jerry," Well, so what's the difference?"
george, What if she discusses it with Jane?
jerry," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane."
george, How do you know?
jerry, Women aren't like us.
george," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about"
jerry," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, 
              I think"
george," How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking 
              down"
elaine," What do you mean, like laundry?"
george, No.
jerry, Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
elaine, It shrinks?
jerry, Like a frightened turtle!
elaine, Why does it shrink?
george, It just does.
elaine, I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
michael," Thanks for the lobster, Kramer."
kramer," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?"
rachel," Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish."
kramer, You mean you've never tasted lobster?
rachel, No.
kramer," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when 
              you"
carol," Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with 
              us."
jerry," No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable."
elaine," Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun 
              over here."
jerry," Yeah, the lobster'll scare him."
carol, I'm gonna get him.
george," See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to 
              be much"
elaine," Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in 
              Jane's"
george," What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're 
              you"
jane," It's nothing, George."
george," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking"
jane, What is it with you?
jerry,  Easy big fella.
michael," So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the"
kramer," No, I got 'em in the ocean."
michael, The ocean? What'd you mean?
kramer," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all 
              these"
michael, Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those
kramer, Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for
michael, My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at
carol,  Here he is.
kramer, Ahhh! 
elaine," Some night, huh?"
ben," Yeah, I wish I had my telescope."
elaine," Some dinner, huh?"
ben, Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
elaine," Some house, huh?"
ben, It was built by Mark Farman.
elaine," Some ugly baby, huh?"
ben, What did you say?
elaine," I said, uh, some snuggly baby."
ben, He is something.
elaine," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised 
              to hear"
ben," Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be"
jerry, You told her?
rachel," Yeah, what's the big deal?"
jerry," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
rachel," Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed"
george, You're going back to New York now?
jane," Yeah, I have some things to do."
george," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend 
              Rachel,"
jane, So what if I did?
george, And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
jane, I don't know what you're talking about.
george," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is 
              not all"
jane, I'm sure it is.
george," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
kramer, Looking for this? 
rachel," Oh, Kramer! You startled me."
kramer," Well, I thought you might wind up around here."
rachel," Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone 
              was"
kramer, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
rachel, Why not?
kramer," Well, that wouldn't be kosher."
rachel," C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it."
kramer," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch."
rachel," Come on, Kramer."
kramer, Heyahhh!
rachel, I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
jerry," Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle 
              of the"
carol," George, thanks so much for making breakfast."
elaine," George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted."
kramer, I didn't know you could cook.
george," Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious 
              host."
ben," Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (Rachel"
rachel, Good morning.
all," Hey, hey."
rachel," Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, 
              you really"
michael, What happened?
rachel," Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me."
kramer, You'd regret it for the rest of your life.
rachel," You're right, I would have. "
jerry,"  Hey, look at this guy."
george, A little breakfast.
jerry, Yeah.
george,"  And, uh, you eat eggs, right?"
rachel," Yes, I do, thanks."
jerry," Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs 
              like"
rachel, Umm... This is so good.
george," Ah, enjoying them?"
rachel, Mm-hmm.
george," Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with 
              one of"
rachel, There's lobster in these eggs?
george," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
jerry," Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
elaine," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. 
              (Policeman"
michael, Excuse me?
police," I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down 
              a lobster"
kramer, Wonder what's goin' on.
george," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
michael," There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer"
rachel, Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
george," I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael 
              to town."
elaine," Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back 
              in the same"
jerry, I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
elaine, How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
jerry, They got some sort of program.
george," Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some 
              more."
jerry," Hey, isn't that Michael's car?"
elaine, There's Rachel.
george, Where? 
jerry ," It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, 
              the existence of men and their"
elaine ," Oh, thank you!  Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, 
              I can't tell you"
elaine , You really oughtta do something about that cold.
jerry , You got a raise?
elaine ," I don't fool around, baby!"
jerry , I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
elaine ," They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that 
              big Japanese conglomerate."
jerry ," Oh, when did that happen?"
elaine , They're signing the papers next week.
jerry ," Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee 
              table book?"
elaine ," Yeah, they'll definitely do it now."
jerry ," Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're 
              back with Jake Jarmal."
elaine ," Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving 
              in together."
jerry ," Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" 
              Brown would be very proud of you."
jerry , Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
george , I went to the beach. 
jerry ," Oh, the beach."
george ," It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working."
jerry , What is it that isn't working?
george ," Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much 
              promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically 
              speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's 
              uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out 
              there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, 
              has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it 
              to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something 
              to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong."
waitress ," Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee."
george ," Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on 
              toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want 
              the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted 
              ... and a cup of tea."
elaine ," Well, there's no telling what can happen from this."
jerry ," You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon 
              is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and 
              the tuna swim with it."
george , Good for the tuna.
elaine ," Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you."
george , So what? What am I supposed to do?
elaine , Go talk to her.
george ," Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live 
              with their parents, don't approach strange women."
jerry ," Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of 
              tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going 
              right up to them."
george ," Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should."
jerry ," If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite 
              would have to be right."
george ," Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do 
              nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do 
              the opposite, and I will do"
george ," Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking 
              in my direction."
victoria ," Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch 
              as me."
george , My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
victoria , I'm Victoria. Hi.
jerry ," Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, 
              it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, 
              alright ... okay, bye."
kramer ," Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!"
jerry , What's happening?
kramer , The coffee table book. It's a go!
jerry ," Oh yeah, I heard all about it."
kramer ," You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. 
              First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee."
jerry , You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
kramer ," Oh, you better believe it!"
jerry , I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
kramer ," No,no,no."
jerry , What're you gonna talk about?
kramer ," Well, coffee tables."
jerry ," Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something 
              cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye."
jerry ," You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes 
              later get another, same weekend, same money."
kramer , You know who you are? Even Steven
victoria , Are you growing a beard?
george , Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
victoria , I guess ...
george ," I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. 
              If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably 
              isn't gonna work."
victoria ," Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!"
george , Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
victoria , What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?
george , That won't be necessary.
george ," Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying 
              to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna 
              take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand 
              me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll"
victoria ," Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only 
              nine thirty."
george ," I don't think we should. We really don't know each other 
              very well."
victoria ," Who are you, George Costanza?"
george , I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
elaine , Yes.
elaine , Yeah.
elaine , An accident? What happened?
elaine , Oh. Ok. Thank you.
elaine , Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?
jake ," So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started 
              walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip."
elaine ,"  Oh, that is so terrible. 
              That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? 
              Just sickening."
elaine , You want one?
jake , No thanks.
elaine , So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
jake , Where did you get those?
elaine , At the movies.
jake ," Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you 
              went in?"
elaine ," Yeah, he did."
jake , Then when did you get those?
elaine , Right after ... that ...
jake ," So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided 
              to stop off for some Jujyfruit?"
elaine ," Well... the counter...was right there, and..."
jake ," I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent 
              you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect 
              on you."
elaine ," No, no, it does!"
jake ," If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't 
              stop for Jujyfruit!"
elaine , But...Jake...
jake ," I would like to be alone now, please."
elaine ," But, Jake, I didn't..."
jake , Goodnight!
jerry , Broke even.
regis , Can I bring out our next guest now?
regis ," Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, 
              and this is the best part -"
regis , It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!
regis , I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
regis ," I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?"
regis ," Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. 
              Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome Kramer!"
regis ," Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where 
              did you come up with this idea?"
kramer ," Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this 
              is a true story. I was skiing at the time."
regis ," You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill 
              myself, and you're writing books!"
kramer ," Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You 
              stay in school!"
kramer ," You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a 
              coffee table, it turns into a coffee table."
regis , Look at this!
regis , Fabulous!
regis , Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
kramer , That's true. That's right.
regis ," Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?"
kramer ," Oh, it's on file, right here. "
regis ," I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!"
regis , We'll be right back.
jerry , So it's all over?
elaine ," Yeah, it got pretty nasty."
jerry , And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
elaine ," It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit 
              and I got in a cab."
jerry , Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
elaine ," Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first."
elaine , What's all this?
jerry , Played cards last night.
elaine , Oh yeah? How'd you do?
jerry , Broke even.
elaine , You always break even.
jerry ," Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got 
              another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran 
              it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. 
              It never fails! I always even out!"
elaine , Do you have twenty bucks?
jerry , What for?
elaine , Just gimme twenty bucks.
jerry , What the hell was that?
elaine , Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
jerry ," You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and 
              seen if that came back."
elaine ," You know, things were going so good for me, you know, 
              I got the job"
jerry ," Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't 
              stop off for candy first."
george ," Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something 
              is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up 
              was down, black was white, good was -"
jerry, Bad.
george , Day was -
elaine , Night.
george , Yes!
jerry , So you just did the opposite of everything?
george ," Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works 
              for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office 
              kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with 
              the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since 
              I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring 
              every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. 
              This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion."
jerry , So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
jerry , Elaine ... look! A twenty!
elaine , Oh my God.
kramer , Hey boss.
kramer ," How're you doin' there, big guy? "
kramer ," What, have you got yourself a cold?"
kramer ," Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C 
              with rose hips and bioflavenoids."
kramer ," It was pretty good, huh?"
kramer , Because of the coffee thing?
mr.lippman ," Kramer, I'm sorry."
kramer ," What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling 
              ""Sonia Live""?"
kramer ," She's a doctor, I got a thing for her."
george ," Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got 
              fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman."
george ," Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because 
              the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it."
george , Of course.
george ," I am different, yeah."
george ," Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with 
              all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some 
              of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past 
              twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a 
              good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees 
              and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification 
              of your massive ego!"
secretary , Tina Robbins is here to see you. 
man , Who's that?
elaine ," Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, 
              but I've been sub-"
man ," Alright, see ya.  Hey."
tina , Please.
elaine , Hi Tina.
tina, Hi Elaine.
elaine ," So, I haven't seen you in a while."
tina ," Elaine, we have a problem."
elaine ," Well, what is it?"
tina , You're getting kicked out.
elaine , Kicked out?! Why?!
tina ," Well, there's been a number of complaints."
elaine , Yeah? Like what?
tina ," Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief."
elaine , I didn't know who he was!
tina , That's why there's a buzzer.
elaine , What else?
tina ," Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some 
              Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building."
elaine , What else have you got?
tina ," Well, let's see. "
jerry ," I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. 
              If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              your wardrobe."
rachel , I suppose...
jerry ," Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach 
              a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points."
rachel , Jerry ...
jerry , Yes?
rachel , I've been doing a lot of thinking.
jerry , Aha?
rachel ," Well, I don't think we should see each other any more."
jerry ," Oh, that's okay."
rachel , What?
jerry ," Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else."
rachel , You will?
jerry ," Sure. See, things always even out for me."
rachel , Huh?
jerry ," It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for 
              a while. And ... good luck!"
rachel ," Yeah, you too."
jerry , The New York Yankees?!
george , The New York Yankees!
jerry ," Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?"
george ," I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going 
              on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working 
              in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!"
jerry , I can't believe it.
george ," And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that 
              apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?"
jerry , That's a great place!
george ," I'm back in business, baby!"
jerry ," George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you 
              know, things have a way of evening out."
george , Hey! 
jerry , Hi Elaine.
elaine , Hi.
jerry , How're things going?
elaine ," How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? 
              I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my 
              apartment!"
jerry , Why? Why are they doing that?
elaine , I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
jerry , The jewel thief?
elaine ," Yeah, the jewel thief."
jerry , What else?
elaine ," I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta 
              be out by the end of the month."
george ," Well, you could move in with my parents."
elaine ," Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to 
              say, or was that just instinct? "
george , Instinct.
elaine , Stick ... with the opposite. 
jerry ," Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, 
              I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're 
              down. You see how it all evens out for me?"
secretary ," Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here. "
interpreter ," Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake 
              this partnership with your company."
jerry , Is that the end of it?
george ," Yeah, it's the last one."
estelle ," I can't believe you're moving out.  Kramer, 
              is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream."
kramer ," Oh, it's true."
george ," Alright, let's go."
frank , Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. 
george , I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
estelle ," Jerry, did you hear this?"
jerry , He knows what he's doing.
george ," I just want the both of you to know how much you mean 
              to me, and I love you both very, very much."
jerry , Opposite.
elaine ," I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. 
              I couldn't talk!"
jerry , Why'd you have to eat so many?
elaine ," Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know 
              it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant 
              Publishing."
jerry , Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
kramer ," Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to 
              blow his nose?"
elaine ," Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's 
              happened? I've become George."
jerry , Don't say that.
elaine , It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
george ," Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. 
              What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! "
kramer ," Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than 
              yours."
jerry , Ah ... let's call it even.
jerry ," Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories 
              around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches 
              of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there 
              not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get 
              rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at 
              a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is 
              more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee."
george," O.K., Danny, take a swing. &lt;Tartabull swings the bat.&gt; 
        N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder."
tartabull, Really?
george," No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to 
        hear myself talk. Yes, really!"
george, What are all sweatin' for?
tartabull, It's hot in this uniform.
george, Hot? &lt;Feels Tartabull's material.&gt; What is this?
tartbull, What is what?
george," This uniform, what's it made from?"
tartbull," I don't know, cotton?"
george," No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. &lt;Tries to look at 
        the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.&gt; Will 
        you stop it? &lt;Looks at the tag.&gt; Oh. Of course. Polyester! "
tartabull, So?
george, I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
tartabull," Well, this is what they give us."
george, You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
tartabull, You really think cotton's better?
george," Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck."
tartabull," Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. &lt;Leaves.&gt;"
george," Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. 
        &lt;George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something 
        in his back.&gt;"
elaine," Oh, you want one?"
jerry, Yeah.
elaine, I'll get it. &lt;Reaches in her bag for money.&gt;
jerry," That's alright, I got it."
elaine, Jerry!
jerry," Elaine, stop it."
elaine," Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got 
        any money.  Yo! Dogs! Two!"
jerry, I'm sorry.
elaine," Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. 
        Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis. "
jerry," Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?"
elaine," Yeah, she was an editor."
jerry," Right, just like you. "
elaine, Yeah. Can you hold my seat? &lt;Elaine gets up.&gt;
crowd, Hey! Down in front! &lt;Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.&gt;
jerry," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any 
        taller. So you're Miss, uh..."
jerry," I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. 
        &lt;Miss Rhode Island laughs.&gt;"
george, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
jerry," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel."
george, You're incredible.
jerry," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and 
        she's going to be down there for the pageant."
george," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, 
        Jerry!"
jerry," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone."
george," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?"
jerry," No, it's part of the contest rules."
george, What does the chaperone do?
jerry," I don't know, she just sits there."
george, Can she talk?
jerry," I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. &lt;Picks up the phone 
        and dials.&gt;"
george, You're calling her?
jerry," Yeah.  There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen 
        Hanson?"
george," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?"
jerry," Of course, they're polyester."
george," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those 
        things get? They should be wearing cotton."
jerry, Why <i>do</i> they wear polyester?
george, I don't know. That's all gonna change.
jerry, You're going to do something about it?
george, Why shouldn't I?
landis," Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be 
        some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace."
landis, Not many people have grace.
elaine," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have 
        a little grace...not as much as Jackie - "
landis," You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace, 
        or you...don't."
elaine," O.K., fine, I have...no grace."
landis, And you can't acquire grace.
elaine," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace."
landis, Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
landis, Thank you for coming in.
elaine," Yeah, yeah, right."
landis," We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know."
landis, No. &lt;They shake hands.&gt;
elaine, Justin Pitt?
landis, He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
elaine," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce."
landis, Excuse me?
elaine, Nothing. &lt;Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.&gt;
pitt," Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, 
        it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department 
        or not."
landis," Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. &lt;Elaine turns around. With 
        sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie 
        O.&gt;"
elaine, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
jerry," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. 
        You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. 
        They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene 
        yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together 
        later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone.  The chaperone 
        can't make it.  Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're 
        not going? &lt;Kramer enters.&gt; Hold on one second.  Hey, 
        what are you doing tonight?"
kramer, Nothin.'
jerry," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna 
        go?"
kramer, What state?
jerry, Rhode Island.
kramer, They're never in contention.
george, How do you know?
kramer," Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six. 
      "
jerry," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner."
kramer, Giddy-up!
elaine," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes."
pitt," No, there's something else. An indefinable quality."
elaine, Grace?
pitt," Grace, yes. "
elaine, You think <i>I</i> have grace?
pitt," Some grace, yes. "
elaine, Just some?
pitt," Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand."
pitt," Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right 
        away."
george," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?"
showalter," Sure, George."
george, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
showalter," Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing..."
george," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about 
        the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of 
        the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some 
        of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms."
showalter, How so?
george," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not 
        a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton."
showalter," Cotton, huh?"
george," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing 
        games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't 
        you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're 
        happier - they're gonna play better."
showalter," You may have something there, George."
george, Oh - I've got something.
jerry, Congratulations!
elaine," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing."
jerry," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?"
elaine, I attend to his personal affairs. 
jerry, Like what?
elaine," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy 
        him some socks."
jerry, Really! Socks!
elaine, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
jerry," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! &lt;Kramer enters.&gt;"
jerry," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got 
        something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you 
        know what I mean."
kramer, No way!
jerry, What?
kramer," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing 
        while you defile this woman, you're crazy."
jerry," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!"
kramer," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, 
        Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's 
        dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery 
        of everything the pageant stands for. "
jerry, But - 
jerry, But wait a minute...
kramer," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun 
        with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for 
        something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! &lt;Jerry tries 
        to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an 
        inch.&gt;"
kramer," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world 
        a better place?"
karen," As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. 
        If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed 
        the whole world!"
jerry, That's a hell of a plan.  Listen - 
jerry," Alright, Kramer!"
kramer," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these 
        questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions 
        of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, 
        poise counts."
karen," You really know a lot about this, don't you?"
kramer," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won 
        easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
karen," Well, what could she have done?"
kramer, Tape her breasts together. &lt;Jerry is shocked.&gt;
karen, What else?
kramer," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but 
        you got a big waist."
jerry," Hey, come on!"
karen," No, no...it's O.K.  Go on."
kramer," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. "
karen, Really.
kramer," Oh, yeah. Just - <i>thip!</i> - suck you in."
jerry, I'll be right back. &lt;Leaves the table.&gt;
kramer," So, what's your talent?"
karen, Magic.
kramer, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
karen, Six.
kramer," No, five. But you were close. "
kramer, How's your evening?
karen," Well, I'm wearing this red dress - "
kramer, Stop right there.
karen, No good?
kramer, Disaster. 
karen, Why?
kramer," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress."
karen, That makes sense. &lt;The limo stops at Karen's hotel.&gt;
jerry," Well, here we are..."
karen," Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the 
        pageant?"
kramer," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we 
        don't play at all."
karen," I am in your hands. &lt;They shake hands.&gt; Well! Oh, good night, 
        Jerry. &lt;They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his 
        throat.&gt; Kenneth will take you home. &lt;She gets out, leaving Jerry 
        staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.&gt;"
kramer, Hey.
jerry," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell."
kramer," Oh, come on."
jerry," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!"
kramer," Oh, you're poo-pooing!"
jerry," Yes, I poo-poo."
kramer," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. 
        To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!"
jerry, I don't want to stop her!
kramer," You <i>can't</i> stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and 
        go, but this kid has got something! &lt;Turns to leave.&gt;"
jerry," Yeah, so do you. &lt;George enters with a newspaper.&gt;"
george," Well, did you see it?"
jerry, See what?
george," The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! 
         ""Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can 
        breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed 
        anything could be so soft and fluffy.' """
jerry," Boy, they really do sound comfortable."
jerry, I'm working in Atlantic City.
george, Really!
jerry," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come 
        down?"
george," Atlantic City?  Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. 
        I'm in. I'm down."
jerry," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. &lt;Picks 
        up the phone.&gt; She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number..."
elaine," So, what do you think?"
elaine, You don't like them?
pitt," No, I don't like them. "
elaine, What's wrong?
pitt, They're too tight.
elaine, Too tight?
pitt," There's no elastic, you need to pull too much &lt;pulls them up 
        more&gt;."
pitt, They're cutting off the circulation. 
elaine," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. &lt;The phone rings.&gt;"
pitt, Hello?
jerry," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?"
elaine, Sorry. Hello?
jerry," Hey Elaine, it's me."
elaine, Jerry?
jerry, We're going to Atlantic City.
elaine, Really? When?
jerry," Today, right now! Are you in?"
elaine," One second, hang on.  Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would 
        it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?"
pitt, Tomorrow?
elaine, Yes.
pitt, But I was hoping for my new socks today!
elaine," Well, it's just one more day. "
pitt, I'm sorry. I must have them today.
jerry, Why not?
elaine, Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
pitt, Elaine!
elaine, I gotta go. &lt;Hangs up.&gt;
kramer," No. Alright, watch me now. &lt;Karen sits on the bed. Kramer 
        walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile 
        on his face.&gt; Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? 
        Posture."
karen," Yes, I see. O.K."
kramer," Let's try a few more questions, alright? &lt;Karen stands up.&gt; 
        If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, 
        and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep 
        with the enemy's leader, what would you do?"
karen," Kramer, are these questions really that important...?"
kramer," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you 
        can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a 
        thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
george, Hey. 
jerry, Hey.
george, How was the show?
jerry, Good. How was the roulette?
george," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here."
jerry," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!"
pitt," It's good, but..."
elaine, But what??
pitt, Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up. 
pitt," For a while, yes, but not in the long run."
elaine, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! &lt;Holds them up.&gt;
pitt," Oh, forget about those! &lt;Takes the socks from Elaine and throws 
        them on the floor.&gt; Why do you keep mentioning those?"
elaine, What do you want!?
pitt," I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!"
jerry, What the hell is that?
george," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!"
george, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
jerry," Wait a second. &lt;Grabs the icebucket off the counter.&gt; This'll 
        scare 'em off. &lt;Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear 
        a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. 
        Jerry gets back into bed.&gt; Well, good night, Ollie."
george," Good night, Stan."
kramer, What is it?
karen," My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! 
        How am I supposed to do my magic act now?"
kramer, How did this happen?
karen," They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then 
        I found them dead in a pool of water!"
karen, It must have been an accident.
kramer, Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
kramer," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!"
jerry, What? Why? What happened?
kramer, Her birds are dead.
jerry, Birds?
kramer," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic 
        act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? 
        I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that 
        contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who 
        just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! &lt;Kramer 
        turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.&gt;"
jerry," What are you looking at? &lt;Kramer goes out onto the terrace 
        and looks down.&gt; Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, 
        because the water was making the room too cold."
jerry," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an 
        accident!"
kramer," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is 
        a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in 
        our way, you're crazy!"
jerry," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! &lt;Kramer 
        exits.&gt;"
jerry," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's 
        doves with a bucket of water last night."
george, Oh. &lt;Goes back into the bathroom.&gt;
karen," O.K., this is it!"
kramer, How ya feelin'?
karen, I'm a little nervous!
kramer, There's nothing to be nervous about.
karen, But I've never sung before in my life!
philbin," And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!"
jerry, I heard those doves were really incredible. 
george, That's a shame. &lt;Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.&gt;
jerry, It's like watching an animal get tortured.
george," Hey, hey! Yankee game! &lt;Changes the channel.&gt;"
jerry," Oh, great! Alright. &lt;We hear the announcers calling the game.&gt;"
jerry, That's a shame.
kramer, Poise. Poise!

monologue,"<br/>
        =========<br/>
        Its fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that theyre 
        <br/>
        manufacturing millions of pens; constantly were all buying them. 
        I <br/>
        must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. Ive used up maybe 
        two of <br/>
        them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator theres 
        a <br/>
        couple back there but it doesnt account for it. Where are all the 
        pens? <br/>
        Thats why its so embarrassing if you dont have one. 
        You got a pen? Can I borrow <br/>
        a pen? We always have to whisper because its so humiliating. I dont 
        <br/>
        have a pen. Theyre making millions of them every week!   
        I know; where are they?<br/>
"
stationer, May I help you?
elaine," Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil."
stationer," Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000. "
elaine," No, I'm sure you do."
stationer, They're pretty expensive.
elaine," Well, it's for my boss."
stationer, What do you do?
stationer," Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be 
        happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it 
        comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is? "
elaine, Elaine.
stationer," Elaine, . . . and your last name?"
elaine," It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha"
stationer, And your number?
elaine," Uh, aw, KL5-239O."
stationer, Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me. 
elaine," Okay,   Move  along. . . "
jerry, Why did you give him MY number?
elaine, I think he's got ideas. 
jerry, I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
jerry, Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
elaine," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?"
jerry," Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's 
        here."
george," Hey, hey."
elaine, Hey hey
julie, Hi Jerry.
jerry, Hi Julie.
george," Elaine, Julie."
elaine, Hi.
julie, Hi.
julie," Oh, hi.  Elaine's my middle name."
elaine," Oh, mine's ""Ike""."
george," Hey, wanna get some lunch?"
jerry, Just had a big bowl of Kix.
george," Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?"
elaine," Ah, no."
julie," Please come, Elaine."
elaine," No, no. How about if you bring me back something?"
george," Sure, all right, what do you want?"
elaine," Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad? "
george, What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
elaine, They have big salads.
george, I've never seen a big salad.
elaine, They have a big salad.
george, Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
elaine," It's okay, you don't"
george," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?"
jerry," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs."
george," , we'll see you in a little while."
elaine, Maybe I should just get married.
jerry, Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
elaine," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell."
jerry, People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
elaine, You can say that again.
jerry," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm 
        going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house."
elaine, Good for you.
jerry, I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
elaine, Right on baby. 
jerry, What was that?
kramer," That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again."
elaine, Who Gendason?
kramer, Steve Gendason.
.elaine," Why is that name familiar?<br/>
        Hx He used to be a baseball player."
elaine," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?"
kramer," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played 
        with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's 
        beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second 
        shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
elaine, So what?
kramer," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean 
        the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that. 
      "
jerry, Certainly are. 
kramer," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. "
kramer," He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like 
        a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . "
jerry, All right. You're in MY face.
elaine, I still don't see what the big deal is. 
kramer," A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.

julie, I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?
george," Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha "
julie, Although at times can be rather pedantic.
george, He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
julie, And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
george," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the 
        Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. 
        You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" 
        it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All 
        right.  All right. I "
julie," No, no. I'd like to take you out."
george," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference 
        does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless. "
julie," Okay, thanks, George."
wx, Here's your big salad to go.
julie," Oh, thank you. "
jerry,"  Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll 
        tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED 
        your pencil. "
elaine, I told ya'. He has ideas.
jerry, He doesn't even care if a man answers.
elaine, Or you.
george," Hey, hey."
elaine, Hey.
julie, Sorry e're late.
elaine, No problem.
julie, Here's your big salad.
elaine," Thank you, Julie."
julie," Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta 
        meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?"
george," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim."
julie," Sure, George."
george," Ya, you go. "
julie," Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye."
jerry, Bye bye
george, Did you see what just happened?
jerry," Well, that all depends. . . "
george, Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
jerry," Yeah, so?"
george," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad. "
jerry, Is that a fact?
george, Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
jerry, No it isn't. 
george, I mean I'm the one who bought it. 
jerry, Yes you did.
george, You think she should have said something?
jerry, She could have.
george," Oh, I know."
jerry," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. "
george," You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        they knew it. "
jerry, Obviously.
kramer, Turn on the TV.
jerry, What?
kramer, I'm puttin it on
tv," . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have 
        not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining 
        us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters 
        for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners 
        at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been 
        involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray 
        Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper 
        at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse 
        in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something 
        we'll just have to wait."
kramer," Jerry . . . <br/>
        Jerry Well, it has nothing to do with you."
kramer," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he 
        murdered the dry cleaner."
jerry," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to 
        murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that. "
elaine, I like Julie. She's very personable.
george," Yeah, she's very lovely."
elaine, That's great George. 
george, So did you enjoy your lunch?
elaine," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha 
        ha Wht?"
george," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed 
        you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, 
        . . . "
elaine, Even though what?
george," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's 
        the difference?"
elaine," What? What are you trying to say, George?"
george," It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. 
        She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. "
elaine," You want the money for the big salad, George?"
george," No, no,"
elaine, What is the problem?
george," There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby 
        you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing 
        the big salad."
jerry, And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
margaret," Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go 
        out."
jerry," Ah, no , I don't think so."
margaret, Why not?
jerry, We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
margaret," Who is staring?<br/>
        Jerry Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making 
        fun. Come on. It's embarrassing. "
jerry," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know 
        what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, 
        that's a long story. "
jerry, Hello Newman.
margaret," Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was. 
      "
jerry," No, no I don't. Why?"
margaret," You know, Genderson. This is something big. "
jerry, I suppose.
margaret, What did Kramer say? 
jerry, I don't know. Nothing.? 
margaret," Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates 
        . . . Margaret?"
margaret, Hello.
jerry, You two know each other?
newman, You might say that.
margaret, We used to go out.
newman," Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye 
        Jerry. Have fun. Hehe "
jerry, . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
margaret, Just a few times. 
jerry, Why?
margaret, I liked him. 
jerry," You liked, Newman?"
margaret, Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
jerry," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop 
        seeing him. "
margaret, He ended it. 
jerry, . . . HE ended it? 
margaret," YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter? 
      "
jerry," No, no of course not. "
kramer," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. "
jerry, What tee?
kramer, A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
jerry, Newman! She went out with Newman!
elaine, It must be a mistake.
jerry," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that 
        she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? 
        He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. 
        Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did 
        see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing 
        her? "
elaine, Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. 
jerry," No, there's less. "
elaine, It's possible.
jerry, No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil. 
elaine," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. "
jerry," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie."
wx, Would you like some more coffee? 
jerry," No,, but thank you. "
jerry," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got 
        your pencil. "
elaine, Ugh! You are kidding me. 
jerry," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor 
        and got it. "
elaine, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. 
jerry," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it."
elaine, To please Mr. Pitt. 
jerry," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited. 
      "
elaine," Uh, great!"
jerry, Hi Julie.
jerry, Hi. 
elaine, Hi Julie.
jerry," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. "
elaine," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me 
        buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. "
jerry, How do you know THAT?
newman, Who is it.
jerry, It's Jerry.
newman, You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
jerry, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
newman," Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the 
        east wing?"
jerry," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?"
newman, There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
jerry," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little 
        rat's nest. Now, what happened?"
newman," Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what 
        Happened. She wasn't my type. "
jerry, Noit your type? 
newman, Not really. 
jerry," Well, how come? "
newman," Ah, she just didn't do it for me. "
jerry," What, what is wrong with her? "
newman," Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters."
jerry, You don't think she's attractive?
newman," No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me. "
jerry," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. "
newman, Care for some lemonade? 
jerry," No, thank you. "
newman," Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha "
kramer," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the 
        play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of 
        one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry."
jerry, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
kramer," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing 
        up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well 
        I don't have to tell you what happened. "
jerry, What are you so worried about this for?
kramer, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? 
jerry, He did?
kramer," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and 
        they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus 
        denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. "
jerry, So it had nothing to do with you. 
kramer," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. "
jerry," No, I don't think so. "
kramer," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus."
jerry," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think 
        Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I 
        like that. "
jerry," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?"
kramer," Oh, I love curls."
jerry," Yeah,, me too. "
kramer," All right, I'll see you later."
jerry, Where you going?
kramer, Genderson's.
jerry, You're going to see Genderson?
kramer, It's weighing on my conscience. 
george," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were 
        dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender 
        thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?"
julie," Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before."
george, A ha! We're just friends. 
julie," Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing. 
      "
george," Oh, share."
julie," Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about 
        how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make 
        up for the one you bought yesterday."
george," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that. "
julie," Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression 
        that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her? 
      "
george," Well, she probably just assumed. "
julie," Um, did she?"
george," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went 
        out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, 
        that it came from me? "
julie, That's what I'm suggesting. 
george," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
        IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY 
        FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?"
julie," George, all I did was hand someone a bag. "
elaine," It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil 
        right away."
stationer," Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were 
        going to get one someplace else?"
elaine," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry. "
stationer," I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three 
        hours. I had a big fight with the foreman. "
elaine, Really? A fight with the foreman? 
stationer, Yes. 
elaine," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. "
stationer," Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight? "
elaine, Okay. 
margaret," I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody 
        walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is 
        overwhelming. "
jerry, You had how many dates with him? Three? 
margaret, Around three. I don't know. 
jerry, And . . 
margaret," I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung 
        up on him. What are you looking at? "
jerry, What? I'm not looking. Nothing. 
jerry, Why are you looking at my face? 
jerry, Where am I going to look? 
margaret, Kiss me.
jerry, . . . I can't. 
jerry, Newman!
jerry," All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman 
        found this unacceptable. "
elaine," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy. "
jerry, You're going out with the stationery store guy?
elaine, I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no. 
elaine," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You 
        had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought 
        you the big salad. Didn't ya'. "
elaine," Uh, uh."
george," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. 
        But you had to have the BIG SALAD. "
jerry," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get 
        out of here.  Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for 
        Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey 
        Turnpike. "
tv," As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway 
        traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't 
        want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on 
        the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing 
        buddies. "
police, 9-1-1 What are you reporting
kramer," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to 
        see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back 
        off. "
police," Okay, sir, and what's your name?"
kramer, My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! 
genderson, I told you not to take the turnpike.
kramer, I thought we would blend in.
genderson, If we took the palisades this never have happened. 
kramer, we would have had all that bridge traffic. 
genderson," Ah, just drive. "
then, you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!
jerry," how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!"
jerry," I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre 
        toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with 
        all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, 
        by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta 
        pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that 
        you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and 
        this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money 
        down the toilet, but look how close I am!"""
jerry," I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast 
        at Tiffany's"" thing."
george, I think she finds my stupidity charming.
jerry, As we all do.
george," Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll 
        swing by after."
jerry," Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?"
george," Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll 
        love me."
jerry, You're good with the mothers.
george," Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters."
jerry, Maybe you should date the mothers.
george," Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, 
        then I'd really have something goin'."
jerry," Oh, you got something goin'."
george, Yeah.
kramer,  Hey.
george, Hey! 
kramer," Hey, you got a hammer?"
jerry, What do you need a hammer for?
kramer," Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em."
jerry," Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over."
kramer," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. 
        Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, 
        you wanna take a ride?"
jerry," Nah, I don't think so."
kramer,"  George, you wanna go for a ride?"
george,  Nah.
kramer," Oh, COME ON!"
jerry," Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?"
kramer," All right, I've had it with you two. "
jerry," Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other 
        day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?"
kramer, A gymnast!
jerry," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics."
kramer," A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll 
        melt your face."
jerry," Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing."
kramer,"  ""Bailing""?"
jerry," Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just 
        a sexual dalliance."
kramer," Jerry, you should pay that price."
jerry," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?"
kramer, Ch- oo-... what?
george,"  A gymnast! I can't 
        believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast."
jerry,  What is this?
george," What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on."
jerry,"  ""Back on""? What was 
        it doing off?"
george," I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office""."
jerry,  What for?
george," Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances."
jerry," Unbuttoned, or all the way off?"
george," ALL the way, baby!"
jerry, Of course.
kramer,  Yeow! Whoa.
jerry," What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should 
        see the doctor and have it checked out."
kramer,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
jerry,"  You always take the shirt 
        off?"
george, Always.
jerry," Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. 
        I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared."
elaine, What meeting?
elaine, Oh! 
elaine, Yes?
elaine," All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt."
kramer, Elaine?
elaine," Come in, come in!"
kramer," Yeah.  Yah, huh?"
elaine," Ah, right there, yeah."
kramer,"  Yeah, that's..."
elaine," Kramer, it's..."
kramer,  There she blows! 
elaine," Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work 
        to do, okay?"
kramer," Oh, these are nice corners, huh?"
kramer,"  Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. 
        BIG computers."
kramer," Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through 
        the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...  Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!"
kramer," Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids..."
elaine," Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do."
kramer," Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right 
        at you."
kramer,"  Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused.  Waahh! Oh, mama!"
elaine," Kramer, what's wrong?"
kramer, Mama!
elaine," Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?"
kramer," I think I gotta go to the doctor!  Oh, mama!"
lindsay, Mother...
george," Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most 
        important thing in the world is spending time with family."
george,"  Very close, yes. Almost painfully close."
lindsay," Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. 
        George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?"
george," Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait!  Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA!  Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's 
        do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?"
george," Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?"
george," No, I know I don't have to, I want to."
george," I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.  Here we go, all right."
george,  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
elaine,"  Look, there's a spaceship! That is 
        so cool!"
elaine,  Right here.
elaine," No, no, unfocus."
elaine,"  Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right 
        down.  Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting."
elaine," Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?"
elaine, How can I go?
elaine," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea."
jerry,"  So, Ceausescu. He must've 
        been some dictator."
katya, Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
jerry," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. 
        ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"""
katya, And you could not refuse.
jerry," No, you'd have to be crazy."
katya, He was a very bad dictator.
jerry," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad."
jerry," So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. 
        You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, ""What 
        the hell, I'll just eat some trash."""
george," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!"
jerry, Was it in the trash?
george, Yes.
jerry, Then it was trash.
george," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top."
jerry, But it was in the cylinder!
george, Above the rim.
jerry," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse."
george, It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
jerry, Was it eaten?
george, One little bite.
jerry," Well, that's garbage."
george, But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
jerry," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and 
        Bum. You are now a Bum."
jerry, Hey!
kramer, Hey.
jerry, What's with you?
kramer, I got a stone.
jerry, What stone?
kramer, A kidney stone.
jerry," What is that, anyway?"
kramer," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in 
        the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the 
        ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!"
jerry," Oh, that's gotta hurt."
aronson," Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including 
        the stock swap."
elaine," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. "
beck," And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect 
        to be in full-scale production by the spring."
elaine," All right.  Hey, you guys--what's the name of the 
        new company gonna be?"
beck, Moland Spring.
elaine,"  ""Moland""?"
aronson," Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland."
elaine," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything 
        called ""Moland""."
aronson, But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
elaine," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?"
aronson,  We've got to do something about that name.
george,"  No, Lindsay, it was 
        not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. 
        Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I 
        tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage 
        all the time.  It was no big thing. That's right. 
        Oh, okay. Buh-bye.  I'm back in, she gave me a second 
        chance."
jerry, Good for you.
george," Yes, good for me!"
jerry," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it 
        out."
george," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!"
kramer,"  Behold! The Games of 
        the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! "
jerry," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what 
        they do. It's not going to make any difference."
kramer," Jerry, what is your problem?"
jerry," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know 
        what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having 
        to consider people's feelings."
kramer," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?"
jerry, No.
kramer, Tantric yoga?
jerry, No.
kramer," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual 
        delights that most men dare not dream of!"
jerry," Boy, you can really talk some trash.  I guess that's 
        better than eating it."
kramer," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? "
jerry, All right.
george, Did you pass your stone yet?
kramer, Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
jerry,"  Hey, that's her!"
kramer," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.  Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! 
        Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back 
        into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, 
        good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full 
        in, double back, and she sticks the landing!  Perhaps you'd like to keep 
        the tape?  Well, I'll take that as a yes."
jerry,"  Well, here we are."
katya, Yes. We are here.
jerry," How did you stay on that beam like that?  I mean, 
        it's only this wide!"
katya, I can balance myself in any position.
katya," It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's 
        body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics."
jerry, Oh boy...
jerry," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical 
        world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, 
        there was nothing gymnastic about it."
elaine," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?"
jerry," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno."
elaine," No, what?"
jerry," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know..."
elaine," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk 
        and..."
jerry," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of 
        specifics..."
elaine," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?"
jerry," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like 
        the apparatus."
kramer, You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
jerry," See, again, I really don't feel that..."
elaine, The balance beam?
jerry, Could we stop?
elaine,  Not the pommel horse?
jerry, All right. Let's just drop it.
jerry," So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in 
        now because of, you know, last night."
elaine," I dunno, at least three weeks."
jerry,"  Oh, great."
elaine," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly 
        put the kibosh on the big water merger."
jerry, Between Poland and Morgan?
elaine, Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
jerry, Kramer! The stone!
jerry," What happened, did you pass the stone?"
kramer,"  No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and 
        I didn't make it."
george,"  
        ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...""  You call this coffee? "
george, I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
george," Oh, sure. Of course.  Um, 
        uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second.  Here you go, now don't worry 
        about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine."
george," Look at this sparkle.  Mrs. 
        Enright!  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!"
george,"  No, Lindsay, I had accidentally 
        spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have 
        a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a 
        dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother 
        it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see 
        you later. Buh-bye. "
jerry, Strike two!
george, You think I'm going down?
jerry, You're behind in the count.
george, I know.
kramer,"  Hey, what are you doing later?"
jerry," I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you."
kramer," Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first 
        time people are a little shy, a little reticent."
jerry," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks."
kramer," All right, where you going?"
jerry," We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is 
        an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out."
kramer," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon."
jerry," Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this 
        girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!"
kramer," No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry."
jerry," Yeah, well you're going."
kramer," Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!"
elaine," Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?"
elaine," Well, I'm so sorry! I-"
elaine," Oh, sorry.  Hello?"
katya," So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?"
jerry," ""Greatest Show on Earth""!"
katya," My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came 
        by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society."
jerry," Well, they certainly take up a lot of space."
katya," Ah, Misha!"
misha, Katya!
katya," Misha, this is Jerry."
misha," Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? "
katya, 
elaine,"  Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um 
        hold on.  Mr. Pitt!"
elaine," Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called 
        an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!"
elaine,"  Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. 
        Lemme just...  Yeah, I've got it...  Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. 
         Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at 
        that poster!"
elaine,"  No, you don't see it, and you're never 
        going to see it!  
        Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. 
        Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!"
elaine, In about twenty minutes.
elaine," Um, no."
elaine," Uh, Mr. Pitt..."
elaine," Um, there's a just... "
elaine, No?
george," Well, here we are."
lindsay, Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.
george, Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
lindsay, Sure.
announcer,"  Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention 
        to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories 
        above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb."
misha, It is time.
jerry," Well, break a leg."
jerry," Eh, show biz..."
announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!"
jerry," Boy, those capes are really coming back."
jerry, What is that sound?
katya,  It is horrible!
george," Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, 
        huh? Whew!"
katya," He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want 
        you to come with me."
jerry," Oh, why not?"
katya," It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that 
        was all the time I needed to put in."
jerry, Really?
katya," In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that 
        to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights 
        most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the ""Comedian"". 
        You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. "
jerry, Come on. Lets go
elaine," No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis 
              recquet."
jerry, What's it doin here?
elaine," He wanted to have it restrung.  Here I need to 
              pick that up"
landis, Hello
elaine," Oh, Hi."
landis," Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a 
              position"
elaine," Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. "

george, Hey di ho
jerry, C'mon up.
jerry, So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
elaine," augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy"

laura, Yes?
jerry," Hi, is Sandy here?"
laura," Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want 
              to come in?"
jerry, I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
laura, 
jerry, So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
george, Wow.
jerry," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none 
              of"
george," Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A."
jerry, Yeah.
george," Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those."
jerry," And the worst part of course is that she also possessed 
              many of the"
george, I see.
jerry," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
george," Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my 
              advice to you"
jerry," Can't be done, huh?"
george, The Switch?
jerry," ""The Switch."""
george, Can't be done.
jerry, I wonder.
george," Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization 
              no one has"
jerry, They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
george," Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and"
jerry," The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it 
              with or without"
george," All right, dammit, I'm in."
jerry, I couldn't do it without you.
george, All right. Let's get to work.
george," All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some 
              sleep. I'll see"
jerry," Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! 
              It's true! You"
george, We'll come up with something.
jerry," Yeah, sure we will."
george," All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}"
george, I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
george," All right. Let's go over it again, one more time."
jerry," All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage 
               trois with her"
george, That's right.
jerry," And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged 
              effect."
george, Keep going.
jerry," At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the 
              roommate to"
george, Continue.
jerry," The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy 
              even as"
george," A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy 
              is known to"
jerry," Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw 
              in it"
george," You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do 
              with you. She"
jerry, It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
george," {George, finger in the peanut butter jar} This is what 
              I do."
keith, Can I help you?
elaine," Uh, no, I'm OK."
keith, Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
elaine," Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it."
keith," Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no.."
elaine," No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet."
keith," Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what 
              you're doing"
elaine, All right. I'm going I'm going
keith, Not with ...
elaine, Give it give it ..
keith, Leave ...
elaine," All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention 
              any of this to "

george," Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* 
              bit worried that you may have missed the boat?"
elaine," Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your 
              brain."

              you must. But let me tell you something, with "

              for you."
george, Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
kramer," Yeah, yeah. I think he will."
jerry, It sounds like an excellent idea.
kramer," Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to 
              a homeless person."
george," Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to 
              see how those sketch artists do it."
kramer, Here you go brother. Some food for you.
kramer, Now are you going to be here in an hour?
kramer," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's

jerry," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?"
lou," Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet 
              her?"
george," Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the 
              police woman?"
jerry," Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law 
              on my side."
kramer," Hey, man. Enjoy the food?"
kramer," Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now."
kramer," Woah, woah, that's mine."
kramer," No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't 
              give away tupperware."
kramer," I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware 
              you just assume."
robert, I've really got to thank you for this.
elaine," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open 
              minded."
robert, Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.
elaine, Yes indeed.
boss, I'm surprised.
elaine, Really. Why?
boss, No reason.
elaine," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's 
              not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if "
elaine," Oh, hi honey."
elaine, Oh it was such a great night.
jerry, And did they suspect anything?
elaine," No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him 
              honey."
jerry," And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend 
              for homosexuals."
elaine, Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
jerry, You said that already.
elaine, Oh I did?
jerry, Yeah.
elaine, Oh.
jerry, Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
elaine, He's incredible.
jerry," Yeah, but?"
elaine," Yeah, I know."
jerry, So?
elaine, What?
jerry, Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
elaine, Well it did occur to me.
jerry," You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not 
              going to suddenly switch sides. Forget "
elaine, Why? Is it irrevocable?
jerry," Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes 
              his team. He's set with that team."
elaine, We've got a good team.
jerry," Yeah, we do. We do have a good team."
elaine, Why can't he play for us?
jerry, They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
elaine, We just got along *so* great.
jerry," Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              no possibility of sex."
elaine," No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. 
              I perceived a possibility Jerry."
jerry, You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters. 
elaine, I realize that.
jerry, Are you that desperate?
elaine, Yes I am.
jerry," So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's 
              settled. First date, no weapons... All right"
jerry, What are you looking for?
kramer, Tupperware.
jerry, Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
kramer," I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious 
              casserole, but now it won't keep because"
jerry, What about a plastic bag?
kramer, You must be kidding.
jerry, What is the difference?
kramer," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness."
george, So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
kramer," Oh yeah, you talked to her."
george, Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
kramer, Yeah well we go way back.
george, Why didn't anything happen between you two?
kramer, Who's to say it didn't?
jerry, So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
george, Yes I did.
jerry, What did you say to her?
george, What do you think I said?
jerry, I don't know.
george, I told her the truth.
jerry, As you see it?
george," Yes, as I see it."
jerry," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?"
george, What hat?
jerry," You know, you're little hair hat there."
george, No.
jerry, Don't you think she could tell?
kramer," No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful 
              job."
jerry," Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks 
              away."
george, You only think that because you know me.
jerry, Have you noticed people staring at your head?
george," I noticed people staring at my head because they like what 
              they see."
jerry," Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about 
              it."
kramer," No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go 
              over there bald, I never would have"
george," Look, I guarantee she won't know."
kramer," Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the 
              precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou."
jerry," Oh, I'll split a cab with you."
kramer, Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
jerry, Hi Sarge.
tierney," Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't 
              show. Hey any of you guys want to be in"
kramer, Sure. I will.
tierney, Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.
george,"  Oh my god, there she is. That's the 
              face, just like the picture."
denise, George?
george, Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
denise, Likewise. Have you been waiting long?
george," No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago."
denise," Good, good."
george, Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
jerry, What's that?
tierney," A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector 
              test."
jerry," Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that 
              their pants are actually on fire?"
tierney," If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up 
              here. A certain cast member of Melrose"
jerry, Really.
tierney, Have you ever seen the show?
jerry, No.
tierney, You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.
jerry, I admit it. I don't watch it.
tierney," Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly."
jerry, The poly?
tierney, Yeah. I think you've seen it.
elaine, Melrose Place?
jerry, Yes. Melrose Place.
elaine, I just didn't know you watched that.
jerry, Well I do.
elaine," I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or 
              join in the conversation."
jerry, Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
elaine," You mean this whole time we could have been discussing 
              Sydney and Michael and Jane..."
jerry," And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed 
              it."
elaine, Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
jerry," The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test 
              and that needle's going to be going wild."
elaine, That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
jerry," It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing 
              to."
elaine, So what are you going to do?
jerry, I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
elaine," Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?"
jerry," Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, 
              duplicitous, deceptive minds of our"
elaine, Oh god this tastes terrible.
jerry, Did you shake it up?
elaine, No.
jerry, You gotta shake it up.
elaine, No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
jerry," Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me."
elaine," So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and 
              his wife."
jerry, So tonight are you going to make the move?
elaine," Yeah, I think I might."
jerry, Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
george, That's an interesting question.
jerry, How so?
george, How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
elaine, What do you mean bald?
george, What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
jerry, She's bald?
george, She's bald.
elaine, Oh come on.
george," Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there 
              she was (waving his hand over his"
elaine, Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
george," Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor 
              and says ""Give me the Larry Fine."""
jerry, Women go bald?
elaine," Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig."
jerry, Hey.
kramer, Hey.
george, You fixed me up with a bald woman.
kramer, Bald?
george," Yeah, that's right."
elaine," Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because 
              they're bald."
george, So?
elaine,  You're bald!
george, No I'm not. I *was* bald.
george, Elaine.
george," No, no, no Elaine."
elaine,"  I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm 
              doing with it."
george, Nooooo.
robert," Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?"
elaine, Well I figured that's what couples do.
robert, You almost convinced me we were a couple.
elaine, Well it was easy. Really.
robert," Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow."
elaine," Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?"
robert, Upstairs?
elaine, Yeah. Upstairs?
robert, Elaine...
elaine," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... 
              changing teams?"
robert, Changing teams?
elaine, Have you ever thought about it?
robert, But I'm a starting shortstop.
elaine," Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*."
george," I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, 
              it was the best thing that ever happened to"
jerry, Good to have you back.
george," And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to 
              keep seeing the bald woman."
jerry, She's as good as anybody else.
george," Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't 
              a lot of hair on it."
jerry," Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like 
              a bald-again."
george, Going to need a little more coffee here.
jerry," So George, how do I beat this lie detector?"
george," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you."
jerry," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can 
              help me."
george," Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach 
              me to sing like you."""
jerry," All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe 
              I'm doing this."
george," Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe 
              it."
elaine," Hey, I did it."
jerry, What?
elaine, I turned him. He defected.
jerry, Get out!  How? How did you do that?
elaine, Because I'm a *woman*.  Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-
jerry," Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to 
              every woman who's ever said ""Too"
elaine," Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. 
              Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot."

              And if so, did she enjoy it?"
jerry, I don't know.
lou, Did Jane sleep with Michael again?
jerry,"  Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, 
              he slept with her sister. He tricked"
jerry, He went back? What do you mean he went back?
elaine, He went back.
jerry," I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, 
              the sex, the shopping."
elaine," Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have 
              access to the, uh... equipment, what,"
jerry, You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
elaine," Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance."
jerry," Well there's always a place for you, on our team."
elaine, Yeah.  Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
jerry, Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
elaine, Okay.
jerry, Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
elaine," Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire 
              what you've done."
george, Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
elaine, What is the matter?
george," I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. 
              Heh, you like that one? A woman"
kramer," Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with 
              that piece off and was devastated. You"
elaine," I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, 
              and it made him act like a jerk."

jerry," Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug."

jerry, There's a squeeze ketchup.
george, I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
jerry," Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason 
      "
george, Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
jerry, I really don't see the difference.
george," Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle."
jerry, It's subtle.
george," Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?"
jerry,"  Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh."

george, Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
jerry," It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It 
              could be"
kramer," Yeah, or it could be a proctologist."

              nothing."
david," Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it 
              out"
jerry, Swirl.
david, Whatever. I don't even do it.
jerry," Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*."
david," Yeah, that's right."

jerry," Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna 
              do it out"
david," All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, 
              you take"
jerry, Fine.
david, Good!
nancy," Ow, George!  What are 
              you"
george,"  
              Uh...you"
nancy," Well, stop it!"
george, You don't like the move?
nancy, No. I don't.
george, You're kidding.
nancy," No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body."
george, Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
elaine," Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!"
david," No, I'm sorry."
elaine, What?!!
david, I can't do the move.
elaine, What?
david," Oh, he's ruined it for me."
elaine," Oh, oh, come on, please?"
david," No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore."
elaine," Oh, so---so that's it?"
david, I'll come up with some new stuff.
kramer," ""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think 
              I have what"
estelle," Oh, okay."
estelle," Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute."
kramer," Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer.  Proctology."
kramer, Thanks. Have a good day.
kramer, I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
estelle," Oh, really?"
kramer," Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
estelle, And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
estelle," Did he say ""Assman""?"
kramer," Oh, yeah."
estelle, Oh my goodness.
kramer, You got that straight!
estelle, Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
jerry," You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed 
              up the"
george, Supposed to close with the swirl?
jerry," Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression"
george," Yeah, yeah, should've written it down."
jerry, Yeah?
buzzer, Elaine.
jerry," C'mon up.  You know what? Do me a favor. 
              Don't"
jerry," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight 
              hundred"
george," What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's 
              what it"
jerry, Except that it's not Putty.
george, What happened to Putty?
jerry," Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to 
              this other"
george," Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you 
              think?"
jerry," Hey, Elaine."
elaine," Yeah, yeah, hello."
jerry, Is it something I said?
elaine," Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move 
              anymore."
jerry, Really?
elaine," Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this 
              thing."
jerry, What is it?
elaine," Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what 
              it's"
jerry, Huh.
elaine," I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up 
              a lot of"
george, Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle
elaine," Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
george, I think that's mine.
elaine, I'm not surprised.
jerry," Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time 
              you're"
elaine, Why?
jerry," You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this 
              garage is"
elaine, An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
jerry," Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. 
              Just"
elaine," [takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting 
              on the"
jerry," That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
elaine, Fusilli Jerry?
jerry, Yeah. Kramer made it.
george," All right, listen, I'll see you guys later."
jerry," Hey, Assman!"
kramer," Hey, well, this is Sally."
sally, Hello.
jerry, Hi.
elaine, Hi.
kramer, Shall we go?
sally," Okay. [turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing 
              of her"
estelle, You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
frank," You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out 
              with a"
estelle, Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
frank," I got things to do, too."
estelle, Don't upset me! I can't cry!
frank," Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?"
estelle," Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me."
frank, Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
estelle, I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
frank, He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
elaine," Hey, let me ask you a question."
david, Sure.
elaine, What do you charge for blown shocks?
david, What?
elaine," Two, three hundred?"
david, I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
elaine, Ah. 
elaine, What about a bad gasket?
david, Bad gasket?
elaine, Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
david, What is all this?
elaine," Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."
david, What kind of car is it?
elaine, Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
david," All together, that could run about sixteen hundred."
elaine, Oh.
elaine, Is that with the parts and labor?
david, Uh-huh.
elaine, Hmm.
elaine," Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle...."
nancy, Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.
george, It just came to me.
nancy, I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?
george, You mean in the end?
nancy, Uh-huh.
george, A counter-clockwise swirl.
nancy, What's that?
george, What?
nancy, On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.
george, Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
nancy," Give me that.  I wanna see what's on your 
              hand."
nancy," Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've 
              got"
george, It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
nancy," Oh, my god, you're sick. "
george," You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!"
frank," Assman? I'll get him, Assman!"
jerry," Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping 
              me"
elaine, So what are you going to do?
jerry," Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth 
              this."
elaine," Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore? 
            "
jerry," Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do 
              you know"
jerry," Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
frank, Where's your friend Kramer?
jerry, I don't know. Why?
frank, Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
jerry, What do you mean?
frank," In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't 
              know"
jerry," Really, stopping short. That's a good move."
frank, You're not kidding it's a good move!
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
kramer," Hey, Frank."
frank," Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short 
              with"
kramer," C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking 
              about. "
frank," You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split 
              the"
kramer, Bro.
frank, Manssierre!
kramer, Bro!
frank, Manssierre! You...!
frank, Aah!!!
jerry," Oh, my god!"
jerry," If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it."
elaine, Me either.
george, They say this guy's the best.
jerry, He had to use cork-screw pasta.
kramer," Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
kramer, The name on the boat. Look at it.
jerry, Assman!
kramer," Yeah , he's the Assman! 
              Jerry,"
doctor, Which one is the son?
george,  I am.
doctor," Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that 
              this won't"
kramer," Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently 
              get the"
kramer, So...you're the Assman.
frank," It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
estelle," Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! 
              I've"
frank, I fell on some Fusilli.
estelle, Fusilli?
frank," You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It 
              got stuck"
estelle, The proctologist? Are you okay?
frank, Yeah.
estelle," Oh, I was so worried. "
george," Ma, don't cry!"
estelle," Oh, I can't help it!"
george," Ma, your eyes!"
estelle, Oh!
cast,
jerry," What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that 
              gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll 
              be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. "
elaine, Is that the supermodel?
jerry," Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six 
              hours."
elaine, I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
jerry," I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back 
              and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport."
elaine," Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and 
              I am telling him that I am quitting."
jerry, So that's it? You know I never even met the guy. 
elaine, I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
jerry, You're marchin' in.
elaine, I'm marchin'. 
george, Hey.
jerry, Hey. Elaine's quitting.
george, Really?
elaine, I'm marchin' in.
george, I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
jerry, How 'bout the march out?
george," Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're 
              losing."
elaine, This is it. Wish me luck.
jerry, Get a march goin'! March it! 
george," Jerry, I need to borrow your camera."
jerry, Why?
george," Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan 
              up at the office."
jerry, What for?
george," They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with 
              this guy as it is. "
jerry, Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
george, It better be.
elaine," Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you."
pitt, One second Elaine.
elaine, Mr. Pitt...
pitt," Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will 
              to include you as a beneficiary."
elaine, What?
pitt," Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to 
              be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care 
              of after I'm gone."
elaine,  Mr. Pitt...
pitt,"  Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get 
              me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?"
elaine," Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with 
              the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,"
pitt," Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist."
elaine," We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want 
              you to live a long, long time."
george,"  Look at this, I only have one picture 
              left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?"
morgan, Why?
george," Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for 
              us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go...  Anyone 
              ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must 
              get that all the time."
morgan," I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?"
george," No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance... 
            "
jerry, Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.
george, A little? Come on.
jerry," Well, you still shouldn't have said it."
george, You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?
jerry, Maybe.
george," Boy, that is so unfair. I would've marched on Selma if it was<br/>
              in Long Island."
jerry, You'd have marched on Great Neck?
george," Absolutely. I still might. I always hated those girls. They<br/>
              would never date me."
kramer, Hey.
jerry," Hey, there you are."
kramer, So you ready?
george, For what?
jerry, He's taking me to the airport. But we've got a few minutes.
kramer," Oh, yeah. What? You got no luggage?"
jerry," This is it. I'm only going for the day. I just gotta drop by the<br/>
              drugstore and pick up a toothbrush."
kramer, Okay.
george," Hey, Kramer. Who does that look like?"
kramer, I don't know.
george," Come on, come on. Not salt, but...?<br/>
              Kramer What, Pepper Johnson?"
george, No. Sugar Ray Leonard.
kramer," Oh, no way."
george," All right, I'll tell you what. I'll bet you the next three people I<br/>
              ask... two of them will say Sugar Ray."
kramer, How much? $ 100? $200? $ 1000?
jerry," Hey wait a second, what are you doing? You're not betting.You<br/>
              know he's not supposed to bet."
kramer," Come on, Jerry, it's a lock."
jerry," Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three<br/>
              years now. Don't start again."
kramer," But it's a lock, Jerry!"
jerry, No!
jerry, What're you doing about Morgan?
george," You know what would be great? If he could see me with<br/>
              some of my black friends."
jerry," Yeah except you don't really have any black friends. Outside of<br/>
              us, you don't have any white friends either."
joe, Yes?
george," Hello, Joe?"
joe, Who is this?
george, It's me. George Costanza.
joe, Who?
george," Remember I was here a while back? Breakfast at Tiffany's<br/>
              together?"
joe, What do you want?
george," Well, I've rented another video, Joe. And there's some<br/>
              popcorn. I thought we could do it again."
joe, Go away.
george, Remy. Hi.
remy, You?!? What are you doing here?
george," Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie."
joe," Remy, is that you?"
remy," Daddy, that man is here again."
joe," Remy, I want you up here instantly."
george," You know, Remy, I was thinking. Last time we were<br/>
              together, you..."
jerry, That's great. You know what? Leave it. Just pull the car around
kramer, You sure?
jerry," Yeah. I'll take care of it. Just throw that in there, would you?"
jerry, Take an antihistamine.They're over there.
jerry," Yeah, they're great."
jerry," I just saw them. Oh, here. Here you go."
jerry," Have a good day, sir."
kramer, This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.
jerry, I don't see Katie anywhere.
kramer," What's this, a fellow club member?"
jerry," No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college<br/>
              tours. She thinks I'm some big celebrity that has to be pampered and<br/>
              explained every little thing."
kramer, Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks before my flight.
katie, Jerry.
jerry," Oh, hi, Katie."
katie, You found the airport all right?
jerry," Yes, I followed the planes."
katie," I see you're having coffee. Just so you know, they also have<br/>
              decaf as well. Along with a selection of cocktails and soft..."
jerry, Thanks. Thanks for telling me.
elaine, What's going on?
women," I'm Lenore Walker, Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer. I arrived<br/>
              to discuss his will and found Justin had collapsed on the floor."
elaine, Oh my God.
woman, Who are you?
pitt, This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
man," Please, rest Mr. Pitt."
woman, You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
elaine," Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... 
              shopping. How did this happen?"
man," Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine 
              and these other pills."
elaine," Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist."
pitt, I spoke to someone who worked there.
elaine, I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. 
woman, How well do you know her?
katie," Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're 
              gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-"
jerry," Yes, I know. I've flown before."
katie," Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance 
              of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?"
jerry, No.
katie,"  Because even if you have  to 
              go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance 
              until way after take off."
kramer," Hey, how you doin'?"
earl, Pretty good.
kramer, Name's Kramer.
earl," Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where 
              you headed?"
kramer," Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes 
              flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute 
              they're arriving."
earl," Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the 
              Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll 
              bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight 
              to Houston."
kramer," Bet? Um, not betting."
earl, Friendly wager.
kramer," I haven't made a bet in three years, I-"
earl," Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time."
kramer," Okay, how much?"
earl, How 'bout 200?
kramer," You're on, cowboy!"
george, How ya doin'?
man, Okay.
george, Nice day today.
man, What?
george," I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?"
intercom, Now arriving at gate 12...
earl, This could be Mexico City.
kramer," C'mon Seattle, let's go."
earl," Come on, Mexico City!"
kramer," Seattle, yeah!"
intercom, ...flight 42 from Mexico City.
kramer," All right, c'mon, let's go again."
elaine," Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?"
pitt, No.
elaine, You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
pitt, Okay.
katie," It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, 
              he's got a birthday next week."
jerry, I don't care.
katie," By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the 
              pilot is going to be in the audience."
jerry, Who?
katie," Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting 
              out there watching the show."
jerry," I don't care, why are you telling me this?"
katie, I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
jerry, Why would I freak out?  Pilot...
jerry," Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to 
              see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those 
              orange cones you have on the throughway...  on the way... 
              up here... um... I.."
katie," It didn't go very well, did it?"
jerry," No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the 
              audience really freaked me out."
katie, I knew it.
jerry," If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. 
              I became obsessed with him."
katie," Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for 
              a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out."
jerry," Oh, it doesn't matter now."
katie," Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this."
jerry," Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!"
earl," Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... 
              Will that be cash or check?"
kramer," All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon."
earl," All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table."
kramer," All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. "
n, Hello? 
kramer," Yeah, it's, uh, me."
n," Hey, what's up?"
kramer," All right, listen. I need some cash."
n, What for?
kramer," I just need it, that's all."
n," Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh 
              you weak, weak man. Where are you?"
kramer, I'm at the airport.
n, The airport?
kramer," We've been betting on arrivals and departures.  But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash."
n, I don't have that kinda dough.
kramer, Sure you do.
n," Oh no, no, not the bag!"
kramer," Oh help me man, I'm desperate!"
n," All right, all right."
intercom," Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication 
              that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia..."
jerry,  What is the complication?
jerry, Yes?
fa," I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane."
jerry, What?
fa," Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you."
katie," I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has 
              no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there."
jerry, I didn't care.
fa," Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane."
jerry, He can't just throw me off the plane!
fa," Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be 
              a disturbance."
jerry, But I'm not a disturbance!
fa," Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir."
jerry, But someone is waiting for me!
katie," Jerry, I don't want you to freak out."
jerry, I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
katie," There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, 
              which one do you want?"
jerry, Which one do you think I want?
katie, The eight will get you in a little earlier.
jerry, Then we'll make it the eight.
katie," I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]"
jerry, Hotel?
katie," Yeah, it's eight in the morning."
jerry," No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna 
              be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car."
katie," Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?"
jerry," I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! 
              Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?"
katie," Okay, you're a big celebrity. "
george, Yo.
jerry, George.
george," Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?"
jerry," I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's 
              Club..."
george," Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated 
              your apartment when you had fleas?"
jerry," Carl, I think."
george," Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy."
jerry," Yeah, he was nice."
george, What company was it?
jerry, Defent.
george," Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit..."
jerry, You need an exterminator?
george," No, not really."
jerry," Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?"
george, Gotta go.
jerry," George, George!"
jerry," Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?"
woman," Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone 
              for you."
elaine, Hello?
jerry," Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go 
              down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to 
              be late."
elaine," That's at the airport, right?"
jerry," Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll 
              never get another date with her. She'll freak out."
elaine," All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself."
jerry, I am a little freaked out!
elaine," Calm down, I'll take care of it. "
jerry," All right, but you have to go now."
elaine, I said I'll take care of it!
n, Kramer.
kramer, Hey.
n," Okay, here it is."
kramer, Good.  Here's my collateral.
earl," So it's a mailbag, so what?"
n, So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
earl,  David Berkowitz.
n, Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
earl, Where did you get this? 
n," I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on 
              that route."
earl, Any of 'em talk to you?
n, Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
earl,  Your buddy's a helluva guy.
kramer," Yeah, don't I know it."
earl," Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the 
              board. Now, who do you like?"
kramer," All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?"
earl," All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca."
kramer, Double or nothin'.
earl, Double or nothin'.
n, I hope you know what you're doing... 
jerry,  Where are we?
katie, I'm not sure.
jerry, Is this even a road?
katie, Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
jerry, What? Why didn't you wake me up?
katie, You told me not to bother you with minor details.
jerry," No, road is a major detail!"
katie," Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do 
              you have a preference?"
jerry,  Look out!
george, May I help you?
carl, I'm the exterminator.
george," Oh, yes of course, come in."
carl, Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
george," Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I 
              called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is 
              sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?"
carl, Do I know you?
george," Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When 
              you fumigated for fleas over there."
carl," Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?"
george," Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really 
              thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, 
              there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on...  Is Mr. 
              Morgan in?"
phone, Mr. Morgan left for dinner.
george," He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?"
tv," Here's a new twist on car pooling Early this morning, a lost 
              Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in 
              a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, 
              a passenger, seemed a little freaked out."
jerry, That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
pitt," That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug 
              store! He's no pharmacist."
woman," Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier 
              for Elaine. "
george,"  Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's 
              all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh 
              my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, 
              I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl."
carl, I'm the exterminator. 
george," That's... what we used to call him in high school, the 
              exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times."
earl," Well, that Newman was your good luck charm."
kramer," Yeah, he was."
earl," I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks 
              acceptable?"
kramer, Oh I accept.
n,"  ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right 
              next to me. We once double dated."
kramer," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like 
              yourself. "
elaine, Kramer.
kramer, Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
elaine," Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here 
              about his plane in Ithaca?"
earl, What about the plane in Ithaca?
elaine," Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly 
              delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?"
kramer, Boy...
earl, Your friend caused the delay?
elaine, Uh huh.
earl, You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.
kramer, C'mon!
earl," See you around, Cosmo."
kramer, What?
elaine," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. 
              Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!"
pitt," You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye."
elaine, Goodbye? 
jerry, Bridget!
bridget," Jerry, what happened?"
jerry," Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our 
              whole time together."
bridget," Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour."
jerry," Really?  Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!"
george," I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the 
              time."
morgan, Is that right?
carl," Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the 
              rat problems in the kitchen."
morgan,"  I thought so. You really are an 
              exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. "
george," Check, please."
waiter," Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house."
george, Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!

gennice,  
jerry,"  Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over 
        there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's 
        sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't 
        be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't. 
      "
jerry," She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console 
        her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you 
        do in a situation like that? "
george, Where were you?
jerry, I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. 
george," Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have 
        to console her no matter what. "
jerry, Of course.
george," When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving 
        from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage."
jerry," yeah, "
kramer, Hey.
george, Hey. I gotta go.
kramer, Where you going? 
jerry," The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical."
kramer," Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? 
      "
jerry, She might be. She's the star of the show. 
kramer," Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, 
        don't tease me. "
george, I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
kramer," So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe."
george, Gennice palying today?
jerry," Yeah, maybe."
kramer, Who's Gennice?
jerry, That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
kramer," Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?"
jerry, Yeah.
kramer," Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers 
        of the theater world."
jerry," I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back 
        stage and having to think of something to say."
george," Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You 
        know that's a real problem."
jerry," Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? 
        I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The 
        whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though. "
ruby, You late.
elaine," I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't 
        give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus "
ruby," ""That's a shame"". You'll have to wait for Lotus now."
elaine," How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things 
        to do."
ruby," ""Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry."" 
        ""No change for bus"" ""Poor princess."""
elaine," What?, uh?"
ruby," Nothing, won't be long."
lotus," ""Princess wants a manicure."""
sunny," ""Oh lucky me."""
lotus," ""Oh, you got the princess."""
elaine, What is so funny?
ruby, tell knock-knock joke.
elaine," The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling 
        me a dog."
jerry, How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
elaine," Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog 
        the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge "
kramer," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could 
        be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG! "
jerry," Why don't you go to another nail shop?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just 
        being paranoid. "
jerry," What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell 
        you what they're saying."
elaine," Yeah, who speaks Korean?"
jerry," You know who speaks Korean?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine No, who?"
jerry, George's father.
elaine, You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
jerry, He used to go there a lot on business.
elaine, What did he do?
jerry," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, 
        that were manufactured in Korea."
elaine," Uh, "
jerry," George, does your father speak Korean?"
george," Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon. "
jerry," Oh, hi Gennice."
gennice, Hi Jerry.
jerry," This is George, this is Kramer."
gennice, Nice to meet you.
jerry, Playing today?
gennice, No. I'm on the bench today.
jerry, They really stick to that understudy rule.
kramer, So she's coming?
gennice," Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . . Oh no, my frankfurter, 
        my frankfurter fell  . It was really good. I can't believe 
        that I dropped it. "
jerry," It's okayit's just a hot dog,  everything 
        is going to be okay."
gennice, No it  was really good.
kramer," Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi."
bette, Hi.
kramer," Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful."
bette," Uh, thank you."
kramer," Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done."
bette, Really?
kramer, Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
bette, What flavours do they have?
kramer," Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry."
bette, How about Pineapple?
kramer," Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back."
kramer," Oh, uh, uh. "
elaine," Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the 
        shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?"
frank," I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus 
        statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy. "
elaine," uh, ha."
frank, Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
elaine," Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this 
        for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure 
        if you want."
frank," No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think 
        I've got a foot odour problem. "
george," I watched ""Beaches"" on cable last night.  
         Give me a break."
bette, Get some talent then you can mouth off. 
umpire, Strike three.
bette, What? Are you blind?
umpire," What?<br/>
<br/>
        Bette Nothing, nothing."
frank, I had an affair with a Korean woman. 
elaine," Uh, Mr. Costanza, I "
frank," No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. 
        But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me. 
      "
elaine," Mr. Costanza, I, "
frank," Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the 
        foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa 
        juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy""."
bette," Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on 
        special today!"
jerry," Come on George, just loosen up."
jerry, Come on George.
kramer, I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
jerry,  Keep going.
george, Aaaaaah
umpire, SAFE!
george, come on it's just a game.
kramer,"  Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. 
        See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time 
         ""You are the wind"""
tv," the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball 
        in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed 
        her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out 
        for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical."
gennice, . . . Thank you. 
jerry, Well we
gennice," No, please. This is the first time in my life  that anyone 
        has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so 
        hard for everything I ever got.  and I know this is going to 
        be my big break. "
jerry,"  It's okay. Everything is going to be all right. 
      "
kramer," Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! "
jerry, Come back another time.
kramer," SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're 
        all proud of yourselves."
kramer," So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell 
        you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway 
        I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them 
        out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, 
        and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... 
        ...GOOD LUCK... "
elaine," Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank."
ruby," What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure?"
frank, I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
ruby," ""That's the least of his problems."""
frank, What was that?
elaine, What'd they say? What'd they say?
frank, They made a derogatory comment about me.
ruby," ""She's with a man twice her age."" ""He doesn't look 
        like he's got much money either."""
lotus," ""Check out that sweater"". "
ruby," ""I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket."""
lotus," ""What happened to his tail?"""
frank," Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard 
        every word you said. You got some nerve. "
kim," That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung 
        girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual 
        man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in 
        love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take 
        his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight. "
lotus, That man also refuses to take his shoes off. 
frank,  I never seen people treated like this!
ruby, You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out! 
kim, Frank?
frank, Kim?
kramer,"  A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want 
        whit e meat or dark? "
bette, White meat.
kramer," Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. 
        It's your ass buster."
bette, Get me one of those Black and White cookies.
kramer," yeah, all right, yeah.  They don't have any. 
        But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere."
bette," Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not 
        going to be very pleasant to be around."
kramer, Now that's impossible.
elaine,"    I don't even 
        know where I'm going."
peterman, That's the best way to get someplace you've never been. 
elaine," yes,  I suppose, "
peterman, Have you been crying?
elaine," Yes,  you see this  woman, this manicurist,"
peterman," Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket."
elaine," Uh,  thanks."
peterman," Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, 
        deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola. "
elaine, How do you know all that?
peterman, That's my coat.
elaine, You mean..?
peterman," Yes, I'm J. Peterman."
elaine, Oh!
jerry," I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything 
        to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody 
        up. "
gennice," Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed.  YOU 
        CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. You see that? You see what I am going 
        through? "
george," So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my 
        building last night."
jerry," Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. 
      "
gennice," I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever 
        wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy.  
        Nobody in the show will even talk to me."
jerry, Stop your crying will ya?
gennice, What?
george, You heard him.
gennice," Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened."
george," Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't 
        in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh? "
cabbie," Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle 
        Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab."
jerry," Hey, I had nothing to do with it."
cabbie," Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in 
        prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every 
        one of you get out of my cab."
peterman," Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as 
        fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. 
        Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark 
        brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 
        7 through 13. Price $135.00."
peterman, That shirt. Where did you get it?
elaine," Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent 
        at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost 
        terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and 
        mayhem at once. "
peterman, That's NOT bad!
kim," Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off."
frank, I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem. 
kim, I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.
frank," I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your 
        father had to make a federal case out of it."
kim," Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of 
        us. "
frank," Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance 
        on shoe removal."
kim," You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever 
        want to see you again. "
kramer," Hi, here. I made this for your. "
bette,  What is it?
kramer, It's macaroni Midler. 
bette, Macaroni Midler?
kramer," Yeah, see how you're singing?"
bette,"  yeah ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan 
        to Minsk."
kramer," oh, what's that from?"
bette," Oh, that's one of the songs from my show. Bette sings"
kramer, Oh You are so freaking talented.
kramer," Oh, so look who's here. What do you want."
jerry," We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her 
        the whole thing was an accident. "
kramer," No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question."
jerry," What?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything 
        to disturb her. "
george, Who are you to decide?
kramer," I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS! 
      "
george," Hey, look, Kramer,"
kramer, AH! I don't want her disturbed.

elaine," Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved."
jerry, Really? What happened?
elaine," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very 
        nice man. "
jerry, Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
elaine," Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. 
        Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on. "
jerry, That's great. 
elaine, I know.
jerry, That looks pretty good.
elaine," He's in.<br/>
        Jerry Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement 
        yet.<br/>
        Elaine What's to discuss?<br/>
        Jerry Come on! George is getting married!<br/>
        Elaine Is he happy?<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        At the restaurant! George is coming from the bathroom <br/>
        to sit with his bride-to-be.<br/>
<br/>
        George I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is 
        it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?<br/>
        Susan Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.<br/>
        George Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?<br/>
        Susan Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see 
        if it's taken.<br/>
        George A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs 
        exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. 
        That's a complete breakdown of the system.<br/>
        Susan Can we change the subject, please?<br/>
        George Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?<br/>
        Susan No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about 
        it.<br/>
        George It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that 
        the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.<br/>
        Susan Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.<br/>
        George  How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? 
        She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. 
        We don't even share the same interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, he seems pretty happy.<br/>
        Elaine Well, that's all that counts, I guess.<br/>
        Jerry What's the matter?<br/>
        Elaine Oh, nothin'.<br/>
        Jerry Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.<br/>
        Elaine Well, what do you want me to do?<br/>
        Jerry Well, at least have some reaction to it.<br/>
        Elaine Well, I don't.<br/>
        Jerry Maybe you're a little jealous.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?<br/>
        Jerry No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not 
        him.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, yeah. Right.<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, right.<br/>
        Jerry Lainy!<br/>
        Elaine Jerry!<br/>
        Jerry You don't wanna get married?<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, come on!<br/>
        Elaine Oh, you come on.<br/>
        Jerry You're such..."
kramer," Oh, hey!<br/>
        Jerry Hey.<br/>
        Kramer Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. 
        Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware 
        of this?<br/>
        Elaine Oh, dear.<br/>
        Kramer It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the 
        rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that 
        concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one 
        stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our 
        lives, Jerry?<br/>
        Jerry We're gonna change the system.<br/>
        Kramer Yes!<br/>
        Elaine Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just 
        sorry they didn't lock me up.<br/>

kramer," Hey, hey."
george," March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?<br/>
        Jerry Oh, all the way."
george," You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody 
        I wouldn't turn you in."
jerry, Is that so?
jerry," Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?"
kramer, Definitely.
jerry, You're kidding?
kramer," No, no, I would turn you in."
jerry, You would turn me in?
kramer," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it."
jerry, I can't believe your a friend of mine.
kramer, What kind of person are you going around killing people?
jerry," Well, I am sure I had a good reason."
kramer," Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be 
        next?"
jerry, But you know me!
kramer, I thought I DID!
elaine," I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need 
        of some guidance here."
rabbi," Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells 
        which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat 
        free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories 
      "
elaine," Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, 
        George, got engaged ."
rabbi, How wonderful.
elaine," Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just 
        overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment."
rabbi," Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this 
        holiest of unions?"
elaine," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole 
        think makes me . . sick."
rabbi," You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the 
        trees."
elaine," Yeah, I don't know what that means."
rabbi," Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . . "
elaine," You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm 
        smart. I'm attractive."
rabbi, You know my temple has many single functions.
elaine," No, no, it's okay."
rabbi, My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps 
elaine, I don't think so.
rabbi, He owns a flower store. Very successful. 
jerry, So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
kramer," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
jerry, Another Caf Latte?
kramer, You better believe it.
kramer, Since when are you so trendy?
jerry," Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole 
        Caf Latte?"
jerry, I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
kramer," I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't 
        looked back. "
jerry," Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One 
        show only."
kramer, I've always wanted to see this.
jerry," You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a 
        Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying 
        to get a table and I missed it."
kramer," Well, yeah, lets do it uh?"
jerry," Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering. 
      "
jerry, Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
kramer, Maybe I will. 
george," Hi, "
susan, How was your day?
george," Good, good day. How was your day? "
susan, Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
george," Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry."
susan," Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night."
george," The Lowers, really?"
susan," You don't want to go?<br/>
        George No, I want to go."
susan, So what did Jerry have to say?
george," Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have 
        an unbelievable idea today! "
susan," Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me."
george," Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's 
        something else. Are you ready for this?"
susan, Yeah.
george," Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the 
        first day of Spring."
susan, What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
george," No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day 
        of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! 
        Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the "
susan," If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so.  Say 
        so."
george," Still marry , still marry."
susan, You don't love me.
george, Sstill love. Still love.
susan," My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making 
        a mistake."
george," No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going 
        to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference 
        to me. It's fine. Really."
susan, Are you sure?
george," Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff."
jerry, Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
george, How did you know that?
jerry, I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe.
george," I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going 
        to collapse and kill herself."
jerry," tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. 
        That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity. 
      "
george," You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. 
        It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out. "
jerry," Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up 
        sex after."
george, I didn't have any sex.
jerry," You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? 
        I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship."
george, I didn't have make-up sex.
jerry," In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than 
        make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit."
george," Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening! "
woman, 
man, I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
george, Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
man, Are you going to eat thoise fries?
george," This is amazing.  
        Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll 
        feel better "
jerry, . . . Poor bastard.
jerry," Good evening, Rabbi."
rabbi, Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
jerry," Well, Rabbi, well."
rabbi," I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine."
jerry," Yeah, that's right."
rabbi, I hope she's feeling better.
jerry, What do you mean?
rabbi, She didn't tell you?
jerry, No.
rabbi," Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her 
        feeling bitter and hostile."
jerry, is that so? 
rabbi," Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting 
        married."
jerry, Really?
rabbi, She came off as pretty desperate.
jerry, I didn't know any of this.
rabbi," Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. 
        I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation. "
jerry," Hum, well it all comes as news to me. "
g,  Hi.
susan," Hi, how was your day?"
george," Good, good day. How was your day?"
susan," Ah, it was okay. What's going on? "
george," Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to 
        Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute? "
susan," Yeah, sure."
george," You see this is the thing. . . .  I just feel . . . mumble, 
        cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together,  "
susan," George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is 
        what you want."
george, Yeah?
susan," Oh, don't worry your head. Of course."
george, All right. 
elaine, I've got that magazine article for you.
jerry, You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
elaine, Are you
jerry, Understand you had a little talk with him too.
elaine," Yeah, talked earlier."
jerry," Yes I know, I know. "
elaine,. . . What does that mean?
jerry," Nothing, nothing. "
elaine, He didn't mention . . . 
jerry, Yes he did.
elaine, He told you about our conversation?
jerry, We had quite a little chat.
elaine, He told you about . . .
jerry," Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it 
        was you who were getting married instead of him. "
elaine, He told you all that? How could he?
jerry," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say."
elaine, Can he do that? 
jerry, He did it.
elaine, But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth? 
jerry, That's what's so fascinating. 
jerry," You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let 
        you in with it."
kramer, Why not?
jerry, Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
kramer, Well that's stupid 
jerry, That's the rule.
kramer," Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that. "
rabbi," Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again."
e, Yeah
rabbi, Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas? 
elaine," No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why 
        did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about? "
rabbi," Was that a problem for you?<br/>
        Elaine Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't 
        tell anyone else about this, did you?<br/>
        Rabbi Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston 
        in 1F. "
elaine, Mrs. Winston?
rabbi," Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to 
        mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" 
        for you."
elaine," What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did 
        you?"
rabbi, Don Ramsey?
elaine," You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth 
        floor."
rabbi," Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with 
        him"
elaine," my god, you didn't."
jerry," Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me"
kramer," Oh, yow, oow Ah! "
usher," Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?"
kramer, Nothing Nothing. 
usher, Whatya got? One of those Caf Latte's in your shirt? 
kramer, I don't have anything. Ask him.
usher," All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out."
kramer, What?! 
usher, Here you go.
kramer, Ow
jerry," Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man 
        in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip 
        and keep it to ourselves."
elaine," You didn't say this to George, did you?"
jerry," No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married 
        instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?"
elaine," Yeah that! So, . . ."
george, Hey oh. 
elaine," GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since 
        it happened. I'm so happy for you."
george," Alright, thanks a lot. "
elaine," Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it."
george," Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...<br/>
        Elaine Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple 
        of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.<br/>
        George Well, I guess I'm getting older.<br/>
        Elaine Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, 
        but um, please, please give my best to Susan.<br/>
        George Yeah.<br/>
        Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations.<br/>
        George Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four 
        of us could go out together sometime.<br/>
        Elaine Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.<br/>
        George Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building 
        that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.<br/>
        Elaine Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.<br/>
        George Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold 
        your ground or...uh<br/>
        George Nope. I wept like a baby.<br/>
        Jerry What?<br/>
        George Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some 
        reason, I just burst into tears.<br/>
        Jerry You cried?<br/>
        George I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell 
        you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears 
        are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.<br/>
        Jx,Gx &amp; Kx Hey!<br/>
        Jerry Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.<br/>
        Kramer Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. 
        I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.<br/>
        Jerry Suing? What for?<br/>
        Kramer The coffee was too hot.<br/>
        Jerry It's supposed to be hot.<br/>
        Kramer Not THAT hot.<br/>

<br/>
        Rabbi  The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are 
        empty and meaningless.<br/>
        George Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met 
        this guy the other day.<br/>
        Rabbi A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself 
        overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, 
        let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and 
        that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened 
        to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute 
        while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never 
        going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a 
        subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm."
broadcasted," October 5, 1995 for the first time."
,
george," And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine."
elaine," I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. 
              It was just the "
george," Ya know, I was just a little surprised."
jerry," Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer 
              that?"
george, What about all the loser stuff?
elaine," I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never 
              said that. I said"
jerry," I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit 
              it's available, it's"
george,"  Well, scintillating as always."
jerry, Where you going?
george, I'm going shopping with Susan.
elaine, What kind of shopping?
george, Clothes shopping.
elaine, Where are you going?
george, Ross'.
elaine, Oh that's a nice store.

              and we stopped off "
jackie,  Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
kramer, Yeah that's right.
jackie," Half milk, half coffee?"
kramer, Yeah.
jackie, Hm Hm. You take a sip?
kramer, Yes I did.
jackie," Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were 
              you able to sip"
kramer, No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
jackie," Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?"
kramer, Well I think I take a normal sip.
jackie," O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then 
              what happened?"
kramer," Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the 
              movie theater."
jackie," Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee."
kramer," Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?"
jackie," Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem 
              for them. "
kramer, It's definitely preposterous.
jackie, So. Then what happened?
kramer," Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step 
              over someone and"
jackie, Was there a top on it?
kramer, Yeah.
jackie," Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for 
              you?"
kramer, No. They put the top on.
jackie, And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
jackie,"  Suzie. I want you to go down 
              to Java World."
kramer," Ah No no, I haven't."

salesman, Excuse me Mr Ross.
george, See now this I don't get. 
susan, What?
george, The security guard.
susan, What about him?
george, Why does he have to stand?
susan, Because he's a security guard.
george," But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like 
              that all day?"
susan," George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him."
george, Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
susan, Not really. 
george,"  She's not concerned about the security 
              guard. What"
susan," All right George.  
              What do you "
,
jerry," So ah, what did you do last night?"
elaine, Nothing.
jerry," I know nothing, but what did you actually do?"
elaine, Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
jerry, Wow. That really is nothing.
elaine, I told ya.
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
elaine, Hey.
jerry, What are you all dressed up for?
kramer, Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
jerry," Oh yeah, how's that looking?"
kramer," Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says 
              if there is one"
elaine," That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers 
              will vote?"
kramer," Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have 
              weeded you out."
jerry, Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
kramer, Oh I can be quite litigious.
elaine," What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company 
              because there"

jerry," Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?"
kramer, That's right.

jerry," Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association 
              Orchestra."

jerry," Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for 
              you right?"
george,  No. 
jerry,  All right what's it going to be here.
george," Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does 
              it bother you "
jerry, No.
george," See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. 
              I can sense"
jerry, Are you sensing anything right now?
george," Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand 
              on his feet, in"
jerry," Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert."
george," What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that 
              take?"
jerry, Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
george," Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? 
              I would be"
jerry, I know you will.

george, Who?
jerry, His lawyer.
kramer," Yeah, Java World wants to settle."
jerry, What?
kramer," Yeah, I'm gonna be rich."
jerry, Why are they settling?
kramer, Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
jerry, All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
kramer, Yeah that's right.
george,"  I'm gonna need 
              a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!"

              actually I "
elaine, Excuse me?
maestro," Well, ya know I am a conductor."
elaine," Yeah, so?"
maestro," Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called 
              Maestro because"
elaine," Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called 
              Maestro while he "
maestro," I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro 
              in social "
elaine, Maestro huh? O.K.

              chair."

george," No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously 
              a very well "
guard, Nope.
george, Would you like a chair?
guard, I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
george," Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?"
guard," Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your 
              asking."
george, That's exactly my point.
guard, Well who wouldn't?
george," Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear 
              one day and find"

              get that damm balm"
kramer, The Maestro.

kramer, My friend he's a conductor.
jackie," Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you 
              do it?"
kramer, Well my stomach was burning.
jackie, I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
kramer, Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
jackie," Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? 
              Didn't you read"
kramer, Well I ...
jackie,"  No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're 
              unpredictable."
kramer, I'm sorry Jackie.
jackie,  Pull over here driver this is it.
kramer,"  Yeah, get over."
,
jerry, Did you have a good time?
elaine," Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died 
              while he was"
jerry,"  Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus."
elaine, Really?
jerry," So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make 
              you call him Maestro."
elaine," Yeah, I called him Maestro."
jerry, You didn't mind?
elaine," Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to 
              it."
jerry," O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great""."
elaine," I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great""."
jerry, Why not you call him Maestro.
elaine, He is a Maestro.
jerry," Well, I'm great."
elaine, So you say.
jerry," What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?"
elaine, Yeah.  I'm invited.
jerry," You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of 
              the clear blue sky"
elaine, Why?
jerry, I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
elaine," Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there."
jerry, In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
 ,
secretary, Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.
kramer,  I'LL TAKE IT!!

              take it? "
kramer, No.
jackie," I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't 
              there. "
kramer, Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.

              were no houses "
maestro," You didn't find one, did you?"
jerry, No. I'm not really looking.
maestro, Nor should you.
jerry," So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all 
              of Tuscany?"
maestro," The houses are passed down from generation to generation, 
              it's very hard."
jerry," I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?"
maestro, It's booked solid!
elaine, It's BOOKED Jerry!
jerry, How'd you get yours?
maestro," Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about

jerry," You know, the Maestro."

              in Tuscany to rent."
george, Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
jerry, No.
george, So what do you care?
,
jerry," I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to 
              keep me out of "
george," Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. 
              Do you "
jerry, I have no idea.
george, It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
jerry," Oh, no way it's that big."
george, It's a big region.
jerry, Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
george, I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
jerry," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head."
george, All right.
george, So I spoke to the security guard.
jerry, Yeah and?
george," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought 
              him a chair,"
jerry, So are you gonna get him a chair?
george," Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking 
              about a bar stool."
jerry," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check 
              things out. With a"
george, Oh I think I'd go for the back.
jerry, Swivel?
george," I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's 
              chairs. What"

              used to have a "

              on my cafe lattes,"
jerry," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?"
kramer," Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of 
              cafe lattes. But I'm"

clerk," I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know."
george, Innocent mistake.
george," Well, here you go. What do you think?"

[setting," At the window of a house in Tuscany. Elaine and Maestro 
              are talking."
elaine," It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed 
              to get away."
maestro," I told you, it's paradise."
elaine, You're right Maestro.
kramer," Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out."
jerry, You didn't have to push me.
kramer, I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
jerry," 75,000 lira."

elaine, Hello
james, This is your wake up service. It's 715
elaine," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep."
james, Hot date last night?
elaine, I wish.
james," A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your 
        waking up alone."
elaine," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person."
james, Call me James.
elaine," Oh, all right, James. He he he"
george, Your wake up guy asked you out?
elaine," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly 
        intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie, 
      "
jerry, I don't know. Blind date?
elaine," What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never 
        met her."
jerry," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her."
elaine, At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
jerry," I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The 
        question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf."
elaine," Ah, . . . "
george, Now you're off on a topic.
jerry," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf."
elaine, Uh hu.
jerry," Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around 
        the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd 
        possibly be walking around with a sponge."
george," You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know 
        you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking 
        blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. "
elaine, I think she'd figure it out. 
elaine, What? What is this?
jerry, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
elaine, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
jerry, A healthy person. 
george,"  Ow, Ow you squirted me."
jerry," Oh, sorry"
george," Boy, it stings."
wilhelm," George, have you seen Morgan?"
george, No.
wilhelm, He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
george," No, not that I know of. "
wilhelm," Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's 
        a problem with Morgan you can tell me."
george, Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. 
wilhelm, I understand.
jerry," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date."
elaine, I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
jerry, You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
elaine, I think I can tell.
jerry," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?"
elaine, Twenty-five percent.
jerry," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. 
        It's a twenty to one shot."
elaine, You're way off. 
jerry," Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like 
        a leper colony down there."
elaine," So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population 
        is undateable?"
jerry, UNDATEABLE! 
elaine, Then how are all these people getting together?
jerry, Alcohol. 
elaine,  What is your problem?
george, No problem here.
elaine, You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
george, I had no idea.
elaine, Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
george," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that 
        Jerry squirted at me."
elaine, You're eye still hurts?
george," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too."
jerry, Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
george," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?"
jerry," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks."
george," Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's 
        why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso."
elaine," What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?"
george," Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan. 
      "
kramer, Hi guys.
jerry," Hi, "
kramer," Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's 
        signature? "
george, Yeah.
kramer, And Buck Showalter's?
george," It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over 
        the office."
kramer," Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia 
        store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs. "
george," Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees 
        to make a few extra bucks. "
kramer," No, of course not. "
kramer," You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent 
        it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter."
steinbrenner, I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
kramer," Why?<br/>
        STEINBRENNER What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the 
        ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something. "
george, Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? 
mm, Hello.
morgan," Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card? "
george, Birthday card?
morgan," Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for 
        me to sign."

jerry," Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater."
holly, . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
jerry," Well, no, I'm not one of those."
holly," When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee 
        and then dinner here."
jerry, Grandma Memma? 
holly, Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.
jerry," No, I think I would have remembered Memma."
holly," Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma."
waiter, Ready? 
holly," I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour 
        cream, "
jerry, What do you recommend besides the steak?
waiter, The lamb chops are good.
jerry, Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
waiter," It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola."
jerry, You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
waiter, . . . Thank you.
jerry,  Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
james," Hey you, hey you."
elaine," Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?"
james," Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have.

elaine, Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
james," Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. 
        Hey! "
george," Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?"
morgan," I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head 
        that it was more than just a massage."
george, Really?
morgan," Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I 
        will be sleeping on the couch."
george," Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again."
morgan," I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression 
        that I have been slacking off. "
george," Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake 
        up service. She swears by this thing."
morgan," Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, 
        you got that birthday card?"
george," Ah, not yet. "
morgan, Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
george, Yes sir!
elaine," I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started 
        growling at me."
jerry," Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other 
        dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly? "
elaine, Huh huh.
jerry, Did she mention anything about our lunch?
elaine," Uh, kind of."
jerry," What do you mean, ""kind of.""?"
elaine," I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. 
        . . . You know. . . . For a man."
jerry," What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't 
        respect salad eaters."
elaine, You got that right.
jerry," But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?"
elaine, Um uh.
jerry, What is she making?
elaine," I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. 
        She won't mind if you come."

kramer, Sure do.
george," oh, "
kramer, Here you go.
george," Hey, he, "
kramer, You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
george, What is this?
kramer," You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed 
        birthday card that was inside."
george, Who told you to sell the card?
kramer, You did.
george, No I didn't! 
kramer," No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. 
        "
george," I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like 
        acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible."
kramer," Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the 
        hospital ."
george, Well get it back! It's very important. 
kramer," Look, do you want me to get it back or not?"
george,  Get it back!
elaine," Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?"
holly, They're grandma Memma's.
elaine," Oh, I don't remember them."
holly," Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions."
elaine, Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
holly, Everybody like mutton?
jerry," Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off."
kramer, That you Bobby?
bobby,"<br/>
        KRAMER Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with 
        all the Yankee autographs on it."
bobby, Sure do. Mister.
kramer," Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing 
        huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person 
        at the New York Yankees needed this card back. "
bobby," Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world."
kramer," Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee."
bobby, Paul O'Neill. 
kramer," All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, 
        just for you."
bobby, Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?
kramer, For you he would.
bobby, Would he hit two home runs?
kramer," Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something 
        for me."
bobby, I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.
kramer," Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card."
elaine, What about this candelabra?
holly," Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip 
        to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais 
        you only ate . . . salad."
jerry," Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton."
holly, That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
jerry," I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher 
        uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? 
        "
holly, That was in Grandma's study.
elaine," What did you do, ransack the place after she died?"
jerry, This is some FINE mutton.
elaine, I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
jerry," Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . "
elaine," It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I 
        should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. 
        Thanks for mutton."
elaine," Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what 
        you hear."
holly, Where are the napkins?
jerry," What?<br/>
        HOLLY Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them 
        didn't she?"
jerry, I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
holly," You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite 
        me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now. "
elaine, Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a 
jerry," Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?"
elaine, Did you do with the dogs?
jerry," Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going 
        on?"
elaine," These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to 
        get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here."
jerry, Why were dogs chasing you?
elaine," They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one 
        day but I can't tell you right now. "
jerry," I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed 
        and it's where I sleep. "
elaine, We'll have to sleep head to toe. 
jerry, Head to toe?
elaine, Head to toe.
elaine," Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715."
jerry," I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face. 
      "
elaine, You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
jerry, I'll make them later. Uh.
wilhelm, Have you seen Morgan?
george, He's not here?
wilhelm," No, He's late."
george, It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
wilhelm," Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's 
        going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job."
george, . . . gone?
jerry, It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
george," I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, 
        Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan."
elaine," Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly 
        is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her 
        napkins. "
george, Napkins?
elaine," I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins. "
jerry, Because they were in the pockets of my jacket. 
elaine, They were?
jerry, Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton. 
elaine," Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost 
        mauled because of that mutton. "
george, What exactly is mutton?
jerry," I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket? 
      "
elaine," Oh, I must have left it at Jame's "
jerry, You spent the night at James's? Did we?
elaine, Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
jerry, Reversed positions? 
elaine," Yeah, you know, head to toe."
jerry, So what your genitals are still lined up. 
elaine," No, because I slept with my back to him. "
kramer, Mr. O'Neill?
o'neill, Yeah.
kramer," Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me."
o'neill," I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed 
        up. You'd only like half a ""P"" or something."
kramer," No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. 
        I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits. "
o'neill," Sure, I could help you there. "
kramer," Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs."
o'neill, Say what?
kramer," You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers."
o'neill," You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home 
        runs?"
kramer," Yeah, well, no good?"
o'neill," Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs 
        like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get 
        two from?"
kramer, Two is better than one.
o'neill," That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter."
kramer," Well, Babe Ruth did it."
o'neill, He did not.
kramer," Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar? "
o'neill," I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise 
        two."
kramer," Well, maybe I did overextend myself."
o'neill, How the heck did you get in here anyway?
james,"  Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 630 clients 
        because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in 
        my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . .  Fellas! 
      "
tv, The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
kramer," It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?"
bobby, After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.
holly,  It's Holly.
jerry, Yeah. Come on up.
tv," And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep 
        right field and it's gone."
kramer, Yeah.
tv, A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.
kramer, OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
bobby, One more to go.
jerry, Hey. What's all this?
holly, I decided I was going to make you dinner.
jerry, I thought we were going out.
holly," Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge 
        to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you. "
jerry, Franco?
holly," Your butcher, down the street."
jerry, I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
holly, A little.
jerry, That is so Franco.
tv," Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul 
        O'Neill."
kramer," You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one 
        game. Even for Paul O'Neill."
kramer," He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me."
tv," ""Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head 
        . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding 
        . . . "
kramer, Come on Come on!

kramer, GO! GO!!
tv," . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. 
        And the Yankees take the lead."
kramer, An In The Park Home Run!
bobby, Yeay!
kramer," All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way "
tv," That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error 
        charged to Martinez."
bobby," Hey,  "
kramer, Huh? 
bobby,  that's not a home run. 
kramer," Yeah, maybe not technically, but "
bobby, You said he'd hit two home runs.
kramer," Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!"
bobby," Well, you're not taking that card."
kramer," Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that  "
holly," So, is the chop the way you like it?"
jerry, I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
elaine," You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What 
        are you doing here?"
jerry, What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
elaine," I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket."
holly, What about the napkins?
elaine, I didn't take your napkins.
holly, Then who did?
elaine, Ask Jerry.
jerry," We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point 
        is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant."
wilhelm," I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, 
        Morgan, did you ever sign it? "
morgan," No sir, George never gave it to me."
george," No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the 
        card not being here. I, uh, . . . "
kramer," Hi, "
wilhelm," What's this?<br/>
        KRAMER Oh, it's a birthday card."
kramer,"  Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has 
        to catch a fly ball in his hat."
wilhelm," George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going 
        to have it mounted like this?"
kramer, And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
wilhelm," Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work."
morgan," Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed 
        to sign the card now when it's already under glass?"
elaine," Uh, this is,"
holly, Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
james," Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?"
holly, You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
jerry," Hey, what happened to my jacket?"
james," Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed 
        some strange meat in the pocket."
holly, Was it mutton?
james, Could have been.
holly, Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
jerry," Uh, sometimes I use the sofa."
george," You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
steinbrenner," Yes, George, please, come in, come in."
steinbrenner," Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. 
        You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing."
george," Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan. 
      "
steinbrenner," Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent 
        from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it."
george," Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir."
steinbrenner," You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you 
        got his job. "
george," Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right 
        for it."
steinbrenner," Stop it George, he's out, you're in."
steinbrenner, A lot more work you know.
george, I know.
steinbrenner, A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
george, I know.
steinbrenner," Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition 
        you deserve."
george," That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . . "
steinbrenner," You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people 
        go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin,

jerry,"  I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman 
              catalog."
george, This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
elaine, Yeah. What do you do all day?
george, Not that much.
elaine, uh-uh.
jerry," I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more 
              work."
george," Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending 
              that I'm busy."
jerry, How do you pull that off?
george," I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all 
              the time, people think that you're"
elaine," Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!"
jerry," Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!"
george," I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one 
              of those little stress dolls."
elaine, 
jerry," So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan 
              walking shoe yet?"
elaine," No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on 
              it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't!"
jerry, What marathon runner?
elaine," You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when 
              I was working at Pendant,"
jerry," Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept 
              at the Olympics 4 years ago"
elaine," Yeah, that's him."
jerry," He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?"
elaine," Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. "
jerry, How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
elaine," Ah, I know. I know...!"
jerry," I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd 
              think you'd have, like, 6 alarm"
elaine," Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first 
              race in 3 years."
jerry, Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
elaine, What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
jerry, You gotta wake him up!
elaine, Eh...he'll get up...
elaine," Hi, Judy."
judy," Hi, Elaine. How are you?"
elaine, Fine. 
jerry, I've seen her in your building.
elaine, Yeah.
jerry, I didn't know she was married.
elaine,  She's not... and the guy just took off. 
jerry, Whom I gonna tell?
elaine," I know, it's just something you have to say..."
wilhelm," George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went 
              over budget on some of the items,"
jerry, He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
george, I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
jerry," My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an 
              extra 5 and it never came back"
kramer, Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
jerry, What do you do?
kramer," I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter 
              to seven and..."
jerry, Always works?
kramer," It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, 
              your body has an internal"
george, uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
kramer," Lomez, he sold me his hot tub."
jerry, Hot tub?
kramer," Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. 
              "
george, You put a hot tub... in your living room?
kramer," Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage 
              jets oscillating and pulsating, "
george, Is that tolerable?
kramer, Oh...it's tolerable...! 
jerry," Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded 
              you?"
kramer," Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... "
george, He uh...doesn't have any running water?
jerry, I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
elaine," Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul."
jerry," Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you."
jean-paul, Nice to meet you.
jerry, Sorry about the Olympics.
jean-paul, Me too. 
elaine," Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get 
              my deadline extended."
jerry, Ah...catalog writer's block?
elaine," Yeah, that's funny. "
jerry,"  So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?"
jean-paul," Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was 
              the snooze, but no, no snooze."
jerry, AM/PM.
jean-paul," Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume."
jerry, Ah...the volume.
jean-paul," Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio 
              alarm."
jerry," Ah, separate knob."
jean-paul," Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              knob?! "
jerry," Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder 
              than the radio. "
jean-paul," Oh, please, man, please!"
jerry," Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have 
              anything to say about it."
jerry," Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?"
elaine, Jerry...
jerry, It's a simple question...
elaine," I've got an alarm, ok?"
jerry," That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because 
              of that alarm clock?"
jean-paul, Flight to Cleveland?
elaine, It works.
jerry, Elaine...
elaine, It... works!
george, Eh...come oooon...
wilhelm, George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
george, Well...I've got a lot to do!
wilhelm," George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd 
              like you to drop everything."
wilhelm," I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. 
              There's some reps in from"
elaine, Hey. Sorry I'm late.
jerry, You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
elaine, I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
jerry, No.
elaine, What?  What is the problem?
jerry," Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, 
              and you weren't."
elaine, uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
jerry," Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete 
              in a very difficult race,"
elaine, Oh are you?!
jerry, Yes I am.
elaine," Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!"
jerry," Yeah, I know that!"
elaine," Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up 
              with some load o'crap for that"
jerry, I'm not talking about upside down.  I'm talking about waking
elaine," Hey, Jean-Paul."

jean-paul," Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!"
kramer,  What's burning?
elaine," Oh!  My muffin!  Oh, shoot! "
jerry, What happened?
elaine, Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
kramer, This was set for 2 minutes. See?
elaine,  Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
jean-paul, You miss-set the timer...
elaine,"  Jean-Paul, it's not 
              my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,"
jean-paul, Ok.
elaine,"  All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?"

              she's doin'! I gotta take over"
kramer," Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak."

              goin' there."

george," Hey, you bastards."
jerry," Hey, how was the meeting?"
george, I really like those sons of bitches.

elaine, Okay. We ready to go?
george," Yes. Please. Please, let's go."
elaine," Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger."
jerry, No. We gotta go to the soup place. 
elaine, What soup place?
george," Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there."
jerry," He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the 
              other"
elaine, Stunned by soup?
jerry," You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
elaine, Huh. All right. Come on.
jerry," There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is 
              a little"
elaine, Why? What happens if you don't order right?
jerry, He yells and you don't get your soup.
elaine, What?
jerry, Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
george," All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again. 
            "
jerry," All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to 
              your right. "
elaine, What?
jerry, The main thing is to keep the line moving.
george," All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup 
              in a loud,"
jerry," Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. 
              No"
elaine," Oh, boy, I'm really scared!"
jerry, Elaine.
elaine," All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. 
              Whoa! Wow!"
jerry, Ar-moire.
elaine, How much is this?
elaine," Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these 
              things. "
jerry, He gave you the nice face discount.
elaine, Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
jerry, What about the soup?
elaine," I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. "
jerry,  Pardon.
george, This line is huge.
jerry, It's like this all the time.
george, Isn't that that Bania guy?
jerry," Oh, no. It is. Just be still."
george, Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
bania," Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup."
jerry, Hard to believe.
bania," This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. 
              You know"
jerry," Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in 
              line."
bania, Why not?
jerry," Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup 
              again."
bania, Okay. Okay.
george, Medium turkey chili. 
jerry, Medium crab bisque. 
george, I didn't get any bread.
jerry, Just forget it. Let it go.
george," Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
george, $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
george," Yes, please."
george, What?
elaine, What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
super," Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's 
              the rule."
elaine," But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception?"
super," Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even 
              give you a"
elaine," Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me. 
            "
elaine," Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away."
jerry," Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?"
george," You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that 
              and not"
jerry, I gave you a taste. What do you want?
george, Why can't we share?
jerry," I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly"
george, Do you hear yourself?
jerry, I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
george," Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila."
sheila, Hi. Hi shmoopy.
jerry, Hi shmoopy.
sheila," No, you're a shmoopy!"
jerry, You're a shmoopy!
george, I'm going.
jerry," Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?"
george," You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think 
              so."
jerry, Why?
george, I just don't feel like it anymore.
jerry, Just like that?
george, Just like that.
sheila," Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?"
kramer, Hey.

kramer," Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!"
elaine," Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this."
kramer," Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it."
elaine, Do you need anything?
kramer," Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot."
elaine, Mulligatawny?
kramer," Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection 
              by one of"
elaine, Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
kramer," He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. 
              Most"
elaine, All right. I'll be back.
kramer, Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
elaine," Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it."
kramer," No. No, Elaine!"
elaine," Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?"
george, No. I didn't get it.
elaine, Why? What happened?
george, I made a mistake.
elaine, 
george," All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you."
elaine," Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking 
              out of"
george," Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or 
              do you"
elaine," Oh, I know! It is awful!"
george, Why do they have to do that in front of people?
elaine, I don't know.
george, What is that with the shmoopy? 
elaine, Ohh!
george," The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!"
elaine, Ohh! Stop it! I know.
george," I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one 
              is"
elaine, Ugh!
george, And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
elaine," You know, we should say something."
george," You know, we absolutely should."
elaine," I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge 
              turnoff"
george, I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes. 
elaine, Yeah.
george, I still haven't figured him out.
elaine, No. Me neither.
george, All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
elaine," Oh, God!"
george, Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
george, Sorry. Thank you.
elaine," Hi there. Um, uh --  Oh! Oh! Oh! 
              One"

              up. No. No."
kramer, Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
bob, What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
kramer, You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
bob," Look, you wanna get hurt? "
kramer, Huh?
bob," I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get 
              hurt I can"
ray, Bob.
bob, Just pick it up.
kramer," What is this, huh?"
bob, You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?
elaine," I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! 
              I'm gonna"
george," Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste 
              this."
elaine," All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta 
              sit"
kramer," Well, b -- it was stolen."
elaine, Wha--?
kramer," These street toughs, they robbed me."
elaine, Street toughs took my armoire?
kramer," Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You 
              should've"
elaine, I can't believe this!
kramer," Well, where's the soup?"
elaine, Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
kramer, Oh...yeah!
jerry, What are you gonna get?
sheila, I'll decide at the last minute.
jerry," You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!"
jerry, Uh-oh.
sheila, I can kiss anywhere I want to.
sheila," How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?"
jerry, Do I know you?
elaine," So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
jerry, It was a bisque.
elaine," Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has 
              become"
jerry, Really?
elaine," Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to 
              be married."
jerry, Have you tastes the soup?
elaine, Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. 
jerry," See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things 
              up with"
jerry, Hey.
kramer, Yeah. 
elaine, Hey.
kramer, Yeah.
jerry," Oh, thanks."
elaine, There he is.

kramer, No.
jerry, They just wanted the armoire?
kramer, Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
jerry, Yeah?
george, Hup! Hup!
jerry," Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange 
              lately?"
elaine, No. In what way?
jerry," I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, 
              or"
elaine," I don't think George has ever thought he's better than 
              anybody."
george, Hello.
jerry, Hello.
kramer, Hey.
george, Hello.
elaine, Hello.
george, Were you just talking about me? What's going on? 
jerry, Absolutely not.
george, Something's going on here.
kramer," All right,  I'm gonna go get some soup."
elaine, One of these days that guy is gonna get his. 
george," So, how was the movie?"
jerry," Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs."
george," Oh, yeah?"
jerry," Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?"
george, Happy? Why should I be happy?
jerry," I don't know, but you look like you're happy. "
george, Why should I care?
jerry," You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know 
              when"
george," All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because 
              the two of"
jerry, Is that so?
george," Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,"
jerry, Disgusting?
george, People who do that should be arrested.
jerry," Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with 
              her."
george," Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know. "
jerry, What?
george, You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
jerry, You're still with the pact?
george, Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
jerry, All I did was shake your hand.
george, Ah-ha!
kramer," And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like 
              that."
newman," One large jambalaya, please."
kramer," Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, 
              she's very"
newman, Thank you.  Jambalaya!

customer," Uh, gazpacho, por favor."
customer," Um, I'm part Spanish."
kramer, Git.
jerry, It was stupid of me.
sheila," Well, it was very insulting."
jerry, No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
sheila," Well, behind every joke there's some truth."
jerry," What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's 
              no truth"
sheila," Well, I guess you're right."
jerry," So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?"

kramer," DeSoto's 
              down, but Cosmo's got the caboose."
woman," How did 
              this start?"
jerry, Beats me.
captain," Kramer, 
              get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this"
captain," What 
              are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!"
kramer," Don't 
              worry, Cap, I can handle it!"
jerry, Kramer?
captain," You're 
              losing control! Hard right! Hard right!"
jerry," Ah, that's 
              a shame."
peterman," The 
              fire will eat up this entire block!"
peterman," Look, 
              there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger! "
man," But my sleeve, 
              it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!"
peterman," George, 
              give me your ATM card!"
george," I don't 
              have my ATM card."
peterman," George, 
              you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!"
peterman," It's 
              jammed! I'll slide it under the door, "
man," Now give 
              me your code!"
george," What?! 
              Why?"
man," The machine 
              won't open without the code!"
peterman," George, 
              give him your code!"
george, But I-I-I-
peterman," George, 
              there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code,"
man," The code!! 
              The code!!"
susan," Hi. Here's 
              your cash, George. "
george, Hm. Thanks.
susan," And here's 
              your card back. Anyone for Bosco?"
jerry," Oh my god. 
              Look at this."
george, Hm?
perry," It's the 
              new J. Peterman catalog. Look."
george," The Rogue's 
              Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little"
kramer," Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS 
        walk."
elaine, Is that tomorrow?
kramer," Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...&lt;gestures to Elaine to sign the 
        form.&gt;"
kramer," Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with 
        myself."
kramer," I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they 
        think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the 
        walk, baby. &lt;gets up&gt; I'll be right back."
elaine, New jeans?
jerry, Yeah.
elaine, Still a 31 waist?
jerry," Yep. Since college. &lt;Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.&gt; 
        Hey, Lena Small's on this list."
elaine, Lena Small?
jerry," Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and 
        now here's her number."
elaine," Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity 
        list!"
elaine, You're a taking person.
jerry," That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, 
        everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam."
jerry," Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to 
        me."
elaine, What's he look like?
jerry," I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying 
        a speedboat."
elaine, You're buying a speedboat?
jerry," See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. &lt;Elaine 
        laughs.&gt; All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home 
        free."
elaine, I don't know about that.
jerry," So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you 
        wouldn't have gone out with him?"
elaine, Well...
jerry, Yeah. So you really like this guy.
elaine, Very much.
jerry, How's the...sexual chemistry?
elaine," Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping 
        today. &lt;Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.&gt;"
kramer, Are you still on the pill?
elaine," Uh, Kramer..."
kramer," I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an 
        open forum. "
elaine," The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge."
kramer, But wasn't that taken off the market?
elaine," Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves 
        the sponge."
kramer," I read it in <i>Wall Street Week</i>...Louis, uh, Rukeyser."
jerry," Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? 
        I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. 
        Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, 
        I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
susan," You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's 
        really thin."
george, Not as thin as you think.
susan, Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
george," The tag, huh?"
susan, Mmm-hmm.
george," Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's 
        just leave it at that."
susan, What are you talking about?
george, He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
susan," Oh, how could he be so vain?"
george," Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe 
        I just told you that."
george," Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
susan," Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell 
        me everything."
george, Where did you get that from?
susan," Well, we're a couple. It's understood."
george, I never heard of that.
susan," Well, you've never been a couple."
george, I've coupled! I've coupled! 
susan, Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
george," This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's 
        secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it 
        by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the 
        loop!"
george, Hey.
jerry, Hey. What's the matter?
george, I had a fight with Susan.
jerry, What about?
george," Oh...&lt;is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders&gt; ...clothing, 
        something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?"
jerry," I got a date with that girl, Lena."
george," Lena, how'd you meet her?"
jerry," I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... &lt;Jerry stops, and 
        mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number 
        from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica 
        on the phone at work.&gt;"
george," You met her a few weeks ago, but...?"
george," So, uh...wanna double?"
jerry, What?
george," Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic."
jerry, I dunno. &lt;Elaine enters.&gt; Hey.
elaine," Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off 
        the market."
jerry, So what are you gonna do?
elaine," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target 
        search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store 
        in a 25-block radius."
george, Just for these sponges?
elaine," Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. 
        What does Susan use?"
george, I dunno.
elaine, You don't know?
george," I, uh...figure it's something. &lt;Kramer enters.&gt;"
jerry, What are you all out of breath from?
jerry," And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, 
        you're in horrible shape."
kramer," Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!"
jerry," I got a 31 waist, mister!"
kramer," Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
pharmacist, Can I help you?
pharmacist," Actually, we have a case left."
pharmacist, Sixty.
elaine," Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three."
pharmacist, Three. 
elaine, Make it ten.
pharmacist, Ten?
elaine, Twenty sponges should be plenty.
pharmacist, Did you say twenty?
elaine," Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine."
pharmacist," Right. So, you're set with twenty-five."
elaine, Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
jerry," Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my 
        shirt."
jerry, It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
lena, I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
george," Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy."
jerry, They serve soup at 6 a.m.? 
lena, Yeah. That's all they have.
jerry," Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?"""
george, I'd get tired of it.
jerry, How could you not?
lena, Guess who volunteered last week? 
george, Mick Jagger.
lena, No. Maya Angelou.
susan," Oh, the poet!"
lena, I don't know.
lena, Talk to who?
jerry, Is it a lot of cream soups?
susan," Maya Angelou, the poet."
lena," No, I didn't get the chance."
george," Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does 
        a poet need an unlisted number for?"
susan, I'm going to the ladies room.
lena, I'll go with you. &lt;They leave.&gt;
george, What are you looking at me like that for?
jerry, Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
george, What are you talking about?
jerry," Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan."
susan," Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's 
        awful!"
george," I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell 
        you."
susan, But you told me anyway?
george," Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're 
        right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then 
        I'm gonna go by the rule."
susan," Thank you, honey."
george," So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?"
susan, Can we stop by a drug store first?
george, What for?
susan, I'm out of birth control stuff.
george," Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? &lt;Pulls over.&gt;"
susan," Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in."
george, Me run in? Why don't you run in?
susan," You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?"
george, Of course I do.
susan, You do? What?
george," You know. You use the, uh...&lt;mutters something unintelligible 
        under his breath.&gt;"
susan, The what?
george," You know, the uh...&lt;mutters it again.&gt;"
susan," Just get me some sponges, please."
george," Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found 
        out, they just took them off the market."
susan, Off the market? The sponge?
george," Yeah, so you gotta use something else."
susan, I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
george, O.k....&lt;thinks&gt; I think I know where we can get one.
jerry," Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?"
kramer," It's a poker game...&lt;yells to the crowd&gt; And I'm kickin' 
        some serious butt!"
jerry, Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
kramer," Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? 
        Do they look scared?! "
jerry, You're never gonna make it!
billy," You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?"
elaine," O.k. Hold on just a second. &lt;Gets up and heads to the bathroom. 
        George knocks at the door.&gt;"
george," Elaine? It's me, George. &lt;Elaine opens the door.&gt; Hey, 
        sorry to bother you so late. &lt;To Billy&gt; Hey! How ya doin.' &lt;To 
        Elaine&gt; Uh, did you get any of those sponges?"
elaine, Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
george, Well...Susan.
elaine," Ah, Susan uses the sponge."
george, Susan loves the sponge.
elaine," Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out."
george, What?
elaine," I can't do it. No way, there's no how. &lt;Tries to push George 
        out the door. George resists.&gt;"
george," Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not 
        just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know 
        about make-up sex?"
elaine," Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. 
        &lt;Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks 
        the door with his foot.&gt;"
george," Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? 
        Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between 
        you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is 
        all that I have left."
elaine," I'm <i>sure</i> you'll have another fight, George. &lt;Stamps 
        on George's foot and closes the door.&gt;  Hold that thought! 
      "
susan," So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He 
        got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list."
monica, He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
lena, He <i>what?</i>
jerry, How'd you find out?
lena, A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
jerry, George!
lena, Pardon?
jerry," Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just - "
lena, It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
jerry, You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
lena," No, not at all. No problem. &lt;Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. 
        Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of 
        Kramer's apartment.&gt;"
kramer," Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants 
        on!"
jerry, You went all night?
jerry," Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, 
        three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
kramer, AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. &lt;George enters.&gt; Hey!
jerry," So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number."
george, Really? How'd she do that?
jerry, A friend of a friend of Susan's.
george, My Susan?
jerry, Why'd you tell her?!
george," Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other 
        everything!"
jerry," Well you know what this means, don't you? "
george, What?
jerry," You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
george," You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!"
jerry, You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
george," C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again."
jerry," If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed 
        someone?"
george," Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story."
jerry," I don't know, George."
george," So, Lena was upset, huh?"
jerry, You know what? That was the amazing thing. 
george," What, it didn't bother her?"
jerry," No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about 
        this girl."
george, What?
jerry, She's too good.
george, Too good...
jerry," I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about 
        the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!"
george, I see what you mean.
jerry," I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with 
        someone you admire."
george, Where's the depravity?
jerry," No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even 
        has sex. "
elaine, What?
elaine," Hey, I didn't even use one. "
jerry, I thought you said it was imminent.
elaine," Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really 
        sponge-worthy."
jerry, Sponge-worthy?
elaine," Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
jerry," But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
elaine," Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've 
        got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste 
        any of 'em."
george," You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!"
organizer," Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon."
kramer," Uh, no thanks."
organizer, You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
kramer, No.
organizer, But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
kramer, I have to?
organizer, Yes.
kramer," See, that's why I don't want to. "
organizer, But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
kramer, You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. &lt;Walks away.&gt;
organizer, Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
george," Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of 
        them."
susan," Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms."
george," Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got 
        engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever."
susan, Just once...for the make-up sex.
george," Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're 
        way past that."
susan," Come on, just once?"
george," No, no...I hate the condom."
susan, Why?
george, I can never get the package open in time.
susan," Well, you just tear it open."
george," It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's 
        a lot of pressure there."
kramer," Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
kramer," Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just 
        don't wear the ribbon."
bob, Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? &lt;Kramer is frightened.&gt;
elaine," So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
billy," Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy."
elaine, Run down your case for me again...?
billy," Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. 
        I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. 
        Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite 
        good at it."
elaine, You going to do something about your sideburns?
billy," Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns."
elaine, And the bathroom in your apartment?
billy, Cleaned it this morning.
elaine," The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?"
billy," Everything, yeah. It's spotless."
elaine," Alright, let's go. &lt;They head for the bedroom.&gt;"
jerry, Hi.
lena," Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my 
        work with shut-ins."
jerry," Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric 
        group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're 
        free to go at anytime."
lena," Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream 
        soups."
jerry," Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you 
        about something...you know, because you're such a good person - "
lena," Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the 
        water running. &lt;Goes into the bathroom.&gt; Hey, Jerry, can you get 
        me a towel out of my bedroom closet?"
jerry," Oh, o.k. &lt;Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens 
        of boxes of Today sponges.&gt; "
lena," Thanks. So, you were saying...?"
jerry, What? Nothing.
lena," No, you said I was a good person..."
jerry, Oh...
lena, You seem like you want to tell me something.
jerry, Tell you something...I do.
lena," What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything."
jerry," Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing? "
lena, Yeah.
jerry," I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, 
        you know. That's it. &lt;Lena is puzzled.&gt;"
susan," Come on, George, just tear it open."
george," I'm trying, dammit. "
susan, Tear it.
george," I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. 
        You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
susan, Here give it to me.
george, Would you wait a second? Just wait? &lt;They fight over it.&gt;
susan, Give it to me. &lt;She rips it open.&gt; Come on. Come on!
bob, So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
bob," But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all 
        wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?"
kramer," This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to 
        wear!"
cedric, What are we gonna do with him?
bob, I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
jerry, It completely turned her off.
george," Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares 
        about your pants size?"
jerry, I don't wanna be a 32.
george, I'd kill to be a 32.
jerry, She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
george," That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers 
        on those things so hard to open?"
jerry, It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
george," You never run out, do you? &lt;Jerry smiles.&gt; Where's Kramer? 
        Everything's finished here."
jerry," Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my 
        god...Kramer?"
jerry," Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. 
        &lt;Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks 
        at Kramer.&gt;"
george," Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?"
billy, How'd you sleep?
billy," Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?"
elaine, Yep. 
billy, No regrets?
elaine, Nope. &lt;Billy leans in to kiss her.&gt; What are you doing?
billy, What do you mean?
elaine, Oh...I don't think so.
billy, Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
elaine," I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. &lt;Pats 
        Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.&gt;"
jerry,"  I think gum is, is one of the weirdest 
        human"
george, You think she's happy?
jerry, Who?
george,  The cashier.
jerry, Ruthie Cohen?
george,  You know her name?
jerry, Sure.
george, I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
jerry, Maybe that's why she's happy.
kramer,"  Good morning, gentlemen."
jerry, What is this?
kramer,"  Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from 
        the Alex"
jerry, That stinky old movie-house?
kramer,"  Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up 
        the"

kramer," Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. 
        Some"
george," Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch 
        on TV?"
kramer," Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something 
        in"
george, Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
kramer," Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, 
        get the"

kramer," Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown?

george, Really?
kramer," Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my 
        wing."
jerry," Oh, then I'm not worried."
kramer," But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here 
        treat him"
george,"  Breakdown, huh?"
lloyd, Hey Kramer.
kramer," Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. "
lloyd, How you doing?
kramer,  Sit down. 
lloyd, Hi Jerry.
jerry, Lloyd.
lloyd, George.
george," Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?"
kramer," Yeah well, he's doing fine, George."
lloyd,  Gum?
jerry,  That's an interesting package.
lloyd," Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not 
        the most"
kramer," Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious 
        it is. (he"
lloyd, George?
george, I don't chew gum.
jerry,"  Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?"
lloyd," Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask 
        him"
jerry," Nah, don't bother."
lloyd," No, it's no problem."
jerry, I don't want it.
kramer," Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating 
        the"
jerry, Alright.
kramer," Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm."
george, You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.
elaine, Hey.
george, Hey.
jerry," I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. 
        It's a"
elaine, What kind is that?
jerry," It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me."
elaine, Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
george,"  After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete"
elaine," You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. 
        Y... you"
jerry," You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently"
elaine," Yeah? Well, I got news for you."
george," The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my 
        mother"
jerry, And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
george," Right, gotta get going."
jerry, Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
george," Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
jerry, I thought your parents were outta town?
george, Why d'you think I'm going now?
,
pop, Georgie!
george," Hey, Mr Lazzari."
pop," Back in the old neighborhood, ah?"
george," Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks."
pop," Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?"
george," Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight."
pop," The actor, right?"
george, Something like that.
pop, Mind if I look under the hood?
george," Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars."
pop," Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here."
deena," George Costanza, is that you?"
george," Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug.  Oh my gosh, you 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        look as"
deena," Boy, those were some crazy times."
george," Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?"
kramer," The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden 
        era of"
elaine," Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?"
kramer," Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark"
jerry," Oh, can Lloyd really do that?"
kramer," Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. 
        (to"
elaine,  What? Lloyd is here?
elaine," What? No, no, I'd rather..."
lloyd, Hi Elaine.
elaine,"  Lloyd, yes. Hello."
lloyd," Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all 
        sit"
elaine,"  Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have 
        to sit"
lloyd," That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?"
kramer,"  You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just 
        forgot"
jerry," We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the 
        special"
elaine," I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him 
        on again."
jerry," Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable."
,
deena, Poor Lloyd.
george, I know. Completely bonkers!
deena," Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after 
        what"
george, Pop? What happened to Pop?
deena," I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's 
        why I'm"
pop," Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more."
george,"  He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?"
deena," Uhn, it was too much for him."
george,"  Uhm, I, I gotta go."
deena, What?
george," I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. 
        Pop."
george, Pop! POP!!
lloyd," 's a great movie, huh?"
kramer, Yeah.
lloyd, Sorry you forgot those glasses.
jerry, I don't know what I was thinking.
lloyd, How'd you like that gum?
jerry,  Errh.
kramer,"  Ah, he loved it."
elaine," Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, 
        in the"
kramer," Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired."
elaine, Oh. Oh God.
lloyd, You alright?
elaine," Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out 
        in a hot"
elaine," Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always 
        be using a"
cop," Lady, you sold me.  Hey, you with the hose."
kramer," Yeah, put these glasses on."
jerry,"  Well, what's this for?"
kramer," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
jerry, So what?
kramer," Well, he thinks you wear those."
kramer, They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
jerry," Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these 
        on."
kramer," Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit 
        with him on"
george," 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe 
        I paid you"
cashier, I don't think so.
george," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on 
        the bill"
cashier, Not unless you buy something.
george," Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum."
lloyd, Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
george, I don't.
cashier, Take a look.
george, I know I gave it to you.
lloyd," George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry."
george,  Fine. Fine.  Excuse me. 
kramer," Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
jerry," Ah, Lloyd."
lloyd, Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
jerry,"  Oh, the gum."
kramer," Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?"
jerry,"  Uh, alright. "
kramer," Oh, boy."
kramer," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, 
        sitting"
jerry," Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish"
lloyd," Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you 
        to him,"
jerry, 's not necessary.
kramer," Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour."
jerry," I know that, Kramer."
lloyd," Well, if you don't want to..."
kramer," No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, 
        he"
jerry," Yes I do, Kramer."
lloyd, So...
kramer, Yeah?
lloyd," How about that Elaine today, huh?"
kramer," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
lloyd,"  She was practically undressing in front of me at the 
        theatre."
jerry, I didn't see anything.
kramer," Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,"
deena, You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
george," Well, you know.  It's understandable."
deena," I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown 
        I uh,"
george, Warning signs?
deena," Nervousness, irritability, paranoia."
george,"  What?  Wh... what're you talking about? I'm 
        not the"
deena," Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others."
george, All my friends do that.
deena," George, I'm only trying to help..."
deena," I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?"
george, You see that woman on the horse? 
george," She stole twenty dollars from me.  Yeah, I might've"
deena, So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
george,"  Hey! Hey, you!  Come 
        back"
jerry, So you say she was on a horse?
george," I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
jerry," Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. 
        See if"
elaine, Hey.
jerry," Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue."
elaine,  What?
jerry," I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about 
        the"
elaine,"  Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was 
        wide open."
jerry, Maybe it's in the lost and found.
elaine," Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button 
        too,"
jerry," You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you 
        ate it."
kramer," Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you 
        back at"
haarwood," Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles."
kramer," Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?"
haarwood, They're half-glasses.
kramer, Brown?
haarwood," Mmm, yes, yes."
kramer," Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll 
        turn up"
haarwood, Certainly.
haarwood, Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.
george,  Alright. Alright.
george,"  Hang on, it's warming up!"
george,  Oh you mother...
george, Hey! What is your problem?
george," Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left 
        on that"
cashier, Your car's on fire.
george, Aah! Fire!
cashier,  Merry Christmas!
george,  Fire!!
george, Your hose! Where's your hose?!
florist, Cop made me disconnect it.
kramer," Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?"
george, The Jon Voight car is no more.
kramer," Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you 
        want to."
george, No kidding?
kramer, No kidding.
george," Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one."
kramer," Yeah, merry Christmas."
george,  Whatever.
jerry," Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?"
kramer," What, he's not here yet?"
jerry," Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!"
kramer," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses."
jerry, Why?
kramer, They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
kramer,"  Here, try this pair."
jerry," Aw, these are really strong glasses."
lloyd, Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
jerry,"  Yeah, yeah."
kramer,"  Oh yeah, he's all ready to go."
lloyd, Anybody see Elaine today?
kramer," Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check 
        out"
lloyd," Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not 
        wearing,"
jerry, Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
lloyd," Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab 
        a hotdog"
kramer," Uh, yeah."
lloyd," I'd like a hotdog, please."
attendant, Are you outta your mind?
kramer, Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
attendant," This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to 
        be insane"
kramer," No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing 
        wrong"
lloyd," Kramer, maybe..."
kramer," No, no, no, no. I'll show you.  
        One"
attendant,  Okay.
kramer," Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?"
kramer," Yeah, here we go, yeah.  Mmm, oh. That's 
        delicious."
kramer," Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy.  
        I"
elaine," Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?"
florist, How would you happen to know that?
elaine," Well, uhm... I..."
florist,"  You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't 
        you?"
elaine, Uh... I...
elaine," No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!"
elaine, Hey. Hey everybody.
lloyd," Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon 
        Jerry,"
jerry, Lloyd?
jerry, Lloyd?
elaine,  What is Lloyd's problem?
kramer," Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, 
        but this"
elaine," Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose."
kramer," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not 
        one of your"
deena," So, you want my father to pay for this?"
george," You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what 
        he did"
deena, And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
george," No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier."
deena, What cashier?
george, You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
deena, To park her horse?
george," No, she wasn't on the horse."
deena," So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on 
        the horse?"
george, That's right.
george,  And him!
deena, The man with the flowers?
george," Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a 
        little"
george," I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld."
deena, Who?
george," Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls 
        to"
george, Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
george," Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're..."
deena,  That was your best friend?
george," Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses."
deena, That man was wearing glasses.
george," I know. Don't you see.  He was doing it to fool Lloyd 
        Braun!"
lloyd, I'll run in and get the gum.
jerry, Alright.
lloyd, Got any money?
jerry,  Here.
lloyd,  I'll be back.
george," Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is 
        just a"
deena," I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe."
george," Believe me, I am not crazy."
deena," Well, I guess it's possible."
lloyd, Here y'go.
jerry,  Got all this?
lloyd, Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
jerry,  I gave you a hundred dollars?!
lloyd," You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?"
jerry, It's a lotta gum!
kramer, Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
haarwood," Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation 
        of Motion"
kramer," Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W."
haarwood," Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute."
kramer, Is that from Henry the Eighth?
haarwood," Yes, yes, it is."
kramer," Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do 
        you think"
haarwood," Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would 
        fit a"
kramer,  You don't say.
kramer," You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna 
        be so"
george," Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick."
kramer," Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing."
george,"  Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait 
        a minute,"
george,"  Can I get a pack of gum, please?"
guy," I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with 
        lipstick on"
george," What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that?  
        I guess"
deena, Oh my God!
george," No, no. Deena, it's not what you think."
george, Th... this isn't mine.
george, I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
george,  Dee... Deena!
kramer," Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a 
        premiere."
haarwood," Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?"
kramer," Oh, he ran away."
lloyd, Hey Kramer.
kramer, I need to talk to you.
elaine," You know, that button looks very familiar."
haarwood," Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory."
elaine," I, I think that's my button.  You know, 
        I've"
haarwood," Yes, it was in the lost and found."
elaine, Shall I undo it?
haarwood," Oh yes, of course you can."
elaine," Oh, thank you."
haarwood, I'm a little ticklish.
elaine," Oh.  Tickle, tickle."
lloyd, We've really gotta get the Elaine a boyfriend.
kramer," Oh, tell me about it."
elaine,"  I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. 
              Wow! He's so "
elaine," Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific."
jerry, Maybe he'll write a song about you.
elaine, Yeah. Right.  Like that really matters.
jerry, So I take it he's spongeworthy?
elaine," Oh, yeah."
jerry," Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, 
              you know, "
elaine," Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all. "
jerry," Oh, no?"
elaine," Yeah. In fact, he...."

jerry, Oh.
elaine, Yeah. It's surprising.
jerry," Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?"
elaine," No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. 
              I'm not gonna "

kramer," Lindsay olives, Jerry."
jerry," A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue 
              sauce? Ten "
kramer, $17.50. You can't beat that.
jerry, Look...look at this can of tuna!
kramer," Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut."
jerry, This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
kramer," Hey, Clyde!"

kramer," Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here. "
clyde, How ya doin'?
jerry, Hi.

estelle, It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.

estelle," Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if 
              there's "
frank," Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue."
estelle," George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?"
frank, Huh?
george, I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
frank, We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
estelle," It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at 
              Lord's? "
frank," No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people

        so funny."

jerry,  I believe you.

        to the airport."
sally," Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I 
        guess because we're both wacko!  You know what, um..  You have to give this to 
        them for me. Okay? Here.  It's a wedding present."

        to Del Boca Vista, Florida."
george,  I am aware.
frank," So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into 
        a billiard parlor?"
george, A billiard parlor?
frank," Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.."
george," Well, that's.. Elaine!"
elaine," Oh, hi, Frank."
george,"  Sit down. Join us, please."
elaine,"  Actually, 
        I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing."
george,"  Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down."
elaine,"  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo?"
george,  What photo?
elaine," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front 
        of the sign that said ""Costanza""?"
frank,"  There's a Costanza in Tuscany?  Did 
        he look like me? Did you talk to him?"
elaine," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the 
        sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it."
frank," I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo."
elaine, Who is that?
george,"  
        When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind."
frank," I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we 
        separated."
elaine," So, you weren't born here?"
frank," No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. 
        That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse 
        to vote.  They don't want me, I don't want them!"
george," I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are 
        probably a million Costanzas-"
frank,"  Don't bring me down.  Do you have 
        another copy of that photo?"
elaine," No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might."
frank, The Maestro? What Maestro?
elaine," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, 
        but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him."
george, Really? Why?
elaine,"  Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. 
        I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera 
        stars."
george, Who?
elaine, You know the Three Tenors?
george," Yeah..  Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. 
        the other guy."
elaine,  The other guy.
stewardess,  Could I take that box for you?
jerry," Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it."
stewardess," Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head."
jerry," Oh, okay.."
stewardess, There we go.
jerry, Ohh.. look at this..
kramer, What?
jerry," I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess 
        broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because 
        of this  stupid thing."
kramer," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still 
        salvage some sauce.."
jerry," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, 
        and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin."
kramer,  I see..
jerry," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and 
        this was going to be my bit on the show."
kramer," Well, why don't you do your material?"
jerry, I'm out.
kramer,"  Well, you better get to work."
jerry,  Thanks for the tip.
george," Hey, buddies."
jerry," Hey. Hey, this is for you.  It's from.. uh, Susan's 
        roommate, Sally."
george," Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys 
        really hit it off."
jerry,"  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave 
        me the box.  What the hell are 
        you doing?"
kramer,"  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? 
        "
jerry,"  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
kramer,"  Jerry, why don't you do a bit 
        on Styrofoam?"
jerry, Like what?
kramer," Well, uh..  ""What is 
        this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"""
jerry,  Where's the punchline?
kramer, It's all attitude.. 
goerge,"  Well, this is certainly 
        a crappy gift.."
jerry, A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
george," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's 
        a big executive for Federal Express."
jerry," Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just 
        ship it?!"
kramer," Look, it's personalized.  ""The Costanzas"""
george," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it."
kramer," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that."
george," I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool 
        table in my old bedroom."
kramer,"  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock 
        a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.."
kramer," So, what's your game? What do you like to play?"
frank, Eight ball.
kramer," No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight 
        pool.. hmm?"
frank," You like to gamble, Cosmo?"
kramer," Yeah, now and then - you know how it is.."
frank," Five dollars a game, huh?"
kramer, I'll break.
frank, Okay.
george, What's all this?
susan," Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff."
george,  More stuff..
susan,"  Oh, I put up my doll collection.."
george, Oh my God! What is that?!
susan,  What? What is it?
george,  This doll  looks like my mother.
susan," George, it's a doll."
george," I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!"
susan,"  Oh, get outta here.."
estelle," What's going on in here?  Are you two still playing?! You've 
        been up here three hours!"
frank, We still haven't finished the first game.
estelle, The first game?!
kramer,"  Well, we're still, uh, 
        learning the subtleties of the table."
frank,  he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
estelle," Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin."
frank,"  You don't know that!  We're gonna go see him, huh?"
kramer,  As soon as the game is over..
frank,  Oh boy.
kramer," Eleven, corner pocket. "
george, What is this thing doing here?
susan," Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little 
        girl.."
george," Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this.."
susan, Why?
george, I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
susan," Oh, stop it."
jerry," Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush 
        I just got - the Ori-dent."
elaine,  Oh yeah?
jerry," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you 
        just came from the dentist!"
elaine,"  Oh, that's dynamite."
jerry," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the 
        Charles Grodin show?"
elaine, Who else is on the show?
jerry, Uh.. one of the three tenors.
elaine,  The Three Tenors?  Which one?!
jerry, Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
elaine,  The other guy?!
jerry,"  Yeah, the other guy."
elaine,"  My God! I can't believe the other guy's 
        going to be on the show!"
jerry, Why?
elaine," Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged 
        to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?"
jerry, Why not?
elaine,  Wow! The other guy!
jerry," Hey, you look awful."
george,"  I'm on no sleep, bro."
jerry, Problem in the bedroom?
george,"  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls 
        looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it."
jerry, Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
george,"  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty 
        spooky.  It's freakin' me out 
        man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat."
jerry, I thought you didn't want the doormat.
george, I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
jerry," Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New 
        York?"
george," Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited."
jerry," Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and 
        she made me carry that box?!"
elaine, Who's Sally?
george, Susan's college roommate.
jerry," It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to 
        give to Charles Grodin on his show."
george," So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll 
        be delighted to talk to you."
jerry,"  I will - don't worry.  
        In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really 
        heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her 
        lap!"
elaine, That's sounds pretty juvenile.
jerry,  Hey! A dinosaur!
frank," His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until 
        I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could 
        recognize him."
maestro, Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
kramer," Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you 
        in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room."
frank,"  Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do 
        you call it, Kramer?"
kramer, A billiard room.
frank," No, not billiard..  Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, 
        already. Come on.."
kramer,  What?
frank," We call it.. the, uh.."
kramer,  The Place To Be!
frank, The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
maestro,"  Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, 
         if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the 
        symphony."
kramer," Oh, yeah?"
maestro,"  Ohh, my pants.  It's an old conductor's trick I learned from 
        Leonard Bernstein."
kramer, Really?
maestro," You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the 
        performance."
kramer, That's good thinking.
george, You see?.. You see?!
jerry," Well, it doesn't look exactly like her."
george," Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly 
        what she's gonna look like in ten years!"
jerry, Why don't you just get rid of it?
george," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't 
        do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing."
jerry," Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home."
george," Hi, Elaine."
elaine, Did you see that?!
jerry," I'm just glad it's outta here.  What's that? 
        "
elaine," Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors."
jerry, Oh.  Yeah?
sally,  It's Sally.
jerry," Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?"
sally, A whole case.
jerry,"  Excellent.  So, did you buy that electric 
        toothbrush I was telling you about?"
elaine,  No.
jerry, How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
elaine," Eh, I like mine."
jerry," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. 
        Don't you believe me?"
elaine, I don't want it.
jerry,"  I don't understand this. Why 
        wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's 
        better? And it's not a little better - it's much better."
elaine,  It doesn't matter to me.
jerry, Come in.
sally,"  Well, here I am!"
jerry," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally."
elaine, Hi.
jerry, How was your flight?  Pretty uncomfortable?
sally,"  Actually, the seat next to 
        me was empty, so, there was no problem at all."
jerry,"  Oh..  Oh, wait..  This isn't the sauce that I asked for!"
sally," That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. ""The Pride of 
        Memphis!"""
jerry,"  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with 
        that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!"
sally," This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other 
        sauce as  kind of a joke."
jerry," I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going 
        on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing!"
sally, You could just do your material.
jerry,  I don't have any material!
elaine,  He's got nothin'!
doll," Georgie! Don't eat with your hands!  
        Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!"
george,  Don't tell me how to eat!
doll," You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! 
        Why don't you get a new shirt?!"
george,"  Because I like this one!  C'mon, let's go. Let's go!  Oh, hi.. "
woman,"  That man should really be in a sanitarium. 
        "
kramer," Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain 
        perfectly creased."
frank, It's him!  It's Carlo Costanza!
kramer, Come on. Are you sure?
frank, I'd know him anywhere.
maestro," I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation 
        of being kind of a village idiot."
frank, I still say we're related.
maestro,"  Ohh, I love this piece. 
        "
kramer," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot."
frank,  I can't make anything..
kramer,"  Well, that's because you don't know how 
        to follow through correctly."
frank, Follow through? What do you mean?
kramer," Right here, come on, I'll show you..  Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back 
        slowly.."
frank," It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it."
estelle," Oh, my God!"
jerry,"  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do 
        this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about."
elaine," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?"
jerry," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all 
        the time I'd be able to get some work done."
elaine,  Me? Are you talking about me?
jerry,  No. You're never here.
elaine,"  Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?"
jerry," Yeah. Really.  Hey, you know what? Maybe I could 
        talk about that on the show."
elaine, What?
jerry," Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty 
        funny.  I'm gonna call them."
sally, Hello?
jerry," Hello, Susan? It's Jerry."
sally," Hi Jerry, it's Sally!"
jerry,  Oh. Is George there?
sally," No, but he should be home soon."
jerry," Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio 
        with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her."
sally, Is this for your comedy routine?
jerry,  Yes.
sally,  Don't worry.  I'm on the case.
maestro,"  I, uh, think I'll get some air. "
kramer," Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch, 
        fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.  
        You know where it's going.."
elaine, Is George here?
jerry, Not yet.  The other guy.
elaine," It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. 
        Would you mind signing this poster for me?"
carreras, My pleasure. 
elaine,"  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Mr..  
        Camaro.  Mr. Casea?  Well, whatever.  I'm gonna take this to 
        the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center."
jerry,"  Well, that's one hell of a gig.  Hey, look, I got something 
        for you. The Ori-dent!"
elaine,  Ohh.. thank you.  Huh..  Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
jerry," Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of 
        packaging."
elaine,"  How am I supposed 
        to carry this thing?  
        What are you doing?"
jerry," Well, I want to sit down."
elaine, So?
jerry," It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in 
        the pants. "
maestro,"  Madame, 
        you have been an extremely gracious hostess. "
estelle,"  Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. "
frank,"  Here, take a look at this."
estelle,"  Yeah, what is it?"
frank, It's Carlo. I found him!
estelle,"  You've been cooped up in this room 
        too long."
frank,"  You never support me! Let's see what George says 
        about this.. Where're my pants? "
kramer,"  Aw, beautiful!"
sally," Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!"
jerry,  Where's George?
sally," Don't worry, I brought your doll..  Tada!"
jerry,  No! That's the wrong doll!
sally," Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This 
        doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. 
        I think it's a riot!"
jerry,  This is a nightmare.
sally," Oh well, I'll be watching.  Don't screw up. "
jerry, My pants!
stagehand," Mr. Seinfeld, you're on."
maestro, Elaine? What a surprise.
elaine," I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give 
        you this."
maestro," Ohh..  Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush 
        I've heard so much about.."
elaine," No, no, no. Not the toothbrush..  this."
maestro," Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite 
        tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!"
elaine," Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.."
stagehand,"  Maestro, you're on!"
maestro," Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate."
elaine," Oh, ok! "
susan, I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
george, I just wanted a second opinion.
frank,"  Take a look at this. Doesn't that look 
        like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- "
doll," Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!"
frank,"  Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! 
         Come here!"
susan,"  No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!"
frank,"  There! Now 
        what have you got to say for yourself?!"
george,  I told you it looked like her..
frank,"  Carlo! It's me, Frank!  I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?"
man, Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
frank,"  What do you know.. Alright.  
        I guess I was wrong. "

george," Really?  Well, you don't think it had anything 
              to do with what I said, do you?"
jerry, What'd you say?
george," You know, that, that thing about her being too good for 
              him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just 
              being folksy..?"
elaine," Yeah, I thought you were being folksy."
george, Totally folksy.

jerry," Sure, dinner would be fine."
elaine, And I could just be there.  For you.

kramer,"  Yeah, I already did it. 
              It won't come off. The zipper's suck.."

george," What's the difference you just read it and mail it right 
              back. These we'll do."
susan, Why don't they make'em anymore?
clerk," Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes 
              a lot of moisture to make them stick."
george, So we pick up some Elmers
susan, All right. You see what I do for you.

elaine, You don't ask.. You tell.
george,"  What about the letter, should I think about 
              the letter?"
jerry," Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you 
              . What could he do?"
elaine, Start smoking.
george, Smoking.
jerry, Does she hate cigarettes?
george," Yes, she hates cigarettes."

jerry," You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's 
              wedding."
elaine, Really?
jerry," Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably 
              get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester."
elaine, Yeah! You're probably right.

jerry," What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out 
              all the time."

              than a two ton cab."
jerry," No, cab's comin' in right here  Set of plastic 
              hips,"

jerry, So I didn't miss anything?
george," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. 
               Have you"
jerry, Elaine danced?
george, It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
jerry, Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
george," What, you mean you know about this?"
jerry," For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew 
              what to say to her"
george," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit 
              rock bottom."
jerry, And by then you've lost interest.
george," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my 
              father's car. '68"
jerry, What made him get that thing?
george," During that period when my folks were separated he went 
              a little crazy."
jerry, Not a very long trip. 
kramer, Brody's in.
jerry, I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
kramer," Well, you better get on the horn."
elaine," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know 
              better, I'd say"
jerry, How could that be?
elaine," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it 
              could have something"
jerry," No, George was there, he said he had a great time."
elaine," Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related."
jerry," Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
elaine," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host 
              company, and the"
jerry, Now you're talkin' crazy!
elaine," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. 
              What is it?"
jerry,"  Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'."
anna, You have a minute to approve some copy?
elaine," Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the 
              party last night?"
anna, It was a real... kick.
elaine," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?"
anna, As a matter of fact I did.
elaine," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance 
              from him."
anna, Why? He seems harmless.
elaine, Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
anna, Really?
elaine," Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's 
              one of the worst"
anna, And you two are friends?
elaine," Yeah, we're good friends."
george, So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
jerry, Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
george, With extreme prejudice.
jerry, Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
george," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine 
              said I was one of"
jerry," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, 
              suddenly a"
george, I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
jerry," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend..."
george," Yes, yes..."
jerry," The bad fianc, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit 
              risk..."
george," Okay, the point is made."
jerry," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at 
              table as George"
jerry, Half of show business is here.
kramer, There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
brody, Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
jerry, That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
brody, It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
kramer," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell 
              him, Jerry."
jerry, I'm a joke maker.
kramer," All right, here we go, Death Blow. "
jerry,"  Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?"
kramer," Relax, he does that all the time."
jerry, Does what?
kramer," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, 
              huh?"
jerry, May I see you outside for a moment please?
kramer, But I want to--
jerry, Outside!
elaine," Hey, have you seen Anna?"
worker," Uh, she just went to meet your friend George."
elaine, To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
worker," The park, why?"
elaine," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away 
              from him, too!"
jerry, What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
kramer," Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business."
jerry, It's not legitimate.
kramer, It's a business.
jerry, Where did you meet this guy?
kramer," He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 
              94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--"
jerry, Kramer. 
kramer," Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!"
jerry, I don't believe this. 
anna, You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
george," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?"
anna, No... a little. Nice car.
george," Yeah, she's a sweet ride."
anna, Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
george, Maybe.
anna, Well is it or isn't it?
george, Guess not.
elaine,  Stay away from her.
george, I didn't do nothin'.
elaine,  Get in the car.
anna, But...
elaine," You heard me young lady, get in the car.  And 
              you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff."
george, Lighten up.
kramer," Go get 'em, Death Blow!  You okay?"
brody," Uh, I got a cramp."
kramer," Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy."
brody," Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home."
jerry," Hey, what is going on over there?"
brody," Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me."
jerry, Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
kramer," Jerry, if the man is in pain..."
jerry," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he 
              reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right."
brody,  What are you some kind of tough guy?
kramer," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera."
jerry," All right, I'm takin' the camera."
kramer,"  C'mon, let's go."
jerry, Oh man...
kramer," Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?"
jerry, How was the rest of Death Blow?
kramer," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that 
              Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!"
jerry," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours 
              and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!"
kramer," He's quite a character, isn't he?"
jerry," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to 
              pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!"
kramer, I got it. Yep.
brody, Brody.
kramer, Come on up. It's Brody.
jerry," What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again."
kramer," Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up 
              and thank you."
jerry, What if I didn't do it right?
kramer, It's your first time. He'll understand.
jerry," People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. 
              Too many"
kramer," Hey, Brody!"
jerry, Hi.
brody," Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape."
jerry, Yeah.
brody," I've never seen such beautiful work. You're a genius. The 
              zoom-ins, the"
jerry," Well, I did the best I could."
brody," I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry 
              Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an 
              arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility."
brody, May I use your phone?
kramer, Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
kramer, Look at you! You've got another gig!
jerry, I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
kramer," But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy 
              act. We're"
jerry, We're talkin' federal crime here.
brody,"  I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. 
               May I borrow this?  "
kramer," Sure, do you need a glove?"
brody, Nah.
worker," I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers 
              whirled before me limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up 
              dust... "
elaine, What?
anna," Sorry, I got hung up."
elaine, At Yankee Stadium?
anna, This? It's mine.
elaine," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks 
              like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear."
anna, He's not stocky.
elaine, Who did that? Who did that?!?
kramer,"  The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's 
              precious. "
jerry," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when 
              you shot this?"
kramer, That's fine.
jerry, Do you even know what this scene is about?
kramer, It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
jerry," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of 
              his soul."
kramer, Wha? Where?
jerry," Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody 
              and telling him I shot it."
kramer," Nah, he's not going to know the difference."
jerry," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, 
              there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was 
              asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death 
              Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, 
              because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence 
              and strong sexual content you and I take for granted."
kramer, So you'll do the movie? 
jerry," I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. 
              Where are my magic markers?"
kramer, Right here. 
elaine," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did 
              I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. 
              We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.  What?"
kramer,  This umpf thing.
elaine, It's dancing.
kramer," No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally."
elaine, I dance fine.
kramer, You stink. 
elaine," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.  
              Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?"
jerry, I forgot to make my bed. 
elaine," Jerry, do I stink?"
jerry," All right, you're beyond stink."
elaine, But I really enjoy dancing.
jerry," And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' 
              trouble with your staff, not because of George."
elaine, It's that bad?
jerry," Have you ever seen yourself?  Ah, ah, 
              please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the 
              laundry. I'll be right back."
voice, I have George Costanza still holding.
elaine," George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna 
              say to both of you."
george," Yo, Anna."
anna," Hi, George. What're you up to?"
george,  You don't wanna know.
elaine," Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to 
              keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize."
george, What're you talkin' about?
elaine," Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that 
              you're a good and decent person."
george," Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!"
elaine, I never should have given Anna the impression--
george," Pick it up, pick it up!"
elaine," --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed."
george," Elaine, get off the speaker! "
elaine, What?
george, You are ruinin' everything.
elaine, I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
george," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. 
              I'm a"
elaine," George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna 
              talk to George?"
anna," Um, no, I don't think so."
elaine," No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya."
george, I'm a bad man!
brody, So where's the tape?
jerry," No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location."
brody, I need the tape.
jerry," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm 
              gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. 
              And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to 
              talk to 'em."
brody, Are you out of your mind?
jerry, Kramer...
kramer," I know, Jerry. It's okay.  Yeah, look, 
              Brody. Uh,"
brody, Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
jerry," All right. That's it, I can't work like this."
kramer, Jerry...
jerry, I'm off the project. 
kramer, Jerry!
brody, I want the tape.
kramer, Yeah.
george," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?"
jerry, They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
george, Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.
jerry," Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money 
              now. The sad thing"
kramer," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, 
              he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!"
jerry," Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I 
              was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous..."
george, Did you say dangerous?
george, I'm a bootlegger.
anna, You're a what?
george," I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!"
anna, Isn't that illegal?
george, I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
anna, Is this your FiberCon?
george,  Get outta my way!
kramer," Jerry, George got arrested."
jerry, What?
kramer," Yeah. He went at the   Beekman, he tried to land, but they 
              cheesed him."
jerry, Oh now I see.  Yeah.
brody," Brody, I'm comin' up."
jerry, What're we gonna do?
kramer," Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that 
              tape I shot?"
jerry," I think that's it.  
              Sweet fancy Moses!"
kramer," Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! "
brody, Where's the tape?
jerry," Uh, well. It, uh..."
brody, Is that it?
kramer," Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry 
              Again."
brody, How'd it turn out?
kramer, Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
jerry," Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears 
              to be injured."
kramer," Yeah, it's a disturbing image."
jerry," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry 
              again."
anna,"  It's all right, George. You'll just pay 
              a fine and"
george, Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? 
elaine, Anna...
anna," Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything."
elaine," All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. 
              (Mr. Costanza"
frank," Okay, where's my boy?"
george, Oh my God.
frank," I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the 
              call I get? My son is a bootlegger? "
george, Ow! Dad...
frank," Who put you up to this, was it her?"
elaine, All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
frank, My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
elaine, You got that right.
frank, What the hell does that mean?
elaine, It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
frank, You sayin' you want a piece of me?
elaine, I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
frank, You wanna piece of me? You got it! 
jerry," But he's an old man, Elaine."
elaine," Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it."
jerry,"  Hey, it's the bootlegged Death 
              Blow that I shot."
elaine," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that."
jerry, No you don't.
man, You shot Death Blow?
jerry, Yeah.
man, That was brilliant.
jerry, Thank you. 
elaine, You were big.
jerry," I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how 
              are things at the"
elaine," Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every 
              once in a while."
jerry, I wouldn't worry about it.

george," She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my 
              hat, I think "
kramer," Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right 
              out of your"

        auto show, I waited for you, you never came."
elaine," I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?"
jerry, Five minutes. 
elaine, Five minutes? That's it?
jerry, What's the difference? You never showed up.
elaine," I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's 
        for like, forty minutes."
jerry," Well, we barely knew the guy."
elaine," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em."
jerry, That's the way it works.
elaine, When did you tell George to be here?
jerry, I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
elaine, About five.
jerry, That's enough. &lt;They leave. George comes around the corner.&gt;
kramer," So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega."
jerry, How did you know about that?
kramer," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all 
        the other bad checks."
jerry, He can't do that.
george, Fantastic day! Fantastic! 
jerry, What happened?
george," Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, 
        that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose."
jerry, Fantastic.
george," Then, I'm at The Foundation..."
jerry, You're still doing that?
george," Sometimes, once in a while."
jerry, When you feel guilty.
george," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, 
        they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down 
        there and check it out."
kramer, That's caged heat.
george, Yeah-hah!
jerry, What are you gonna do there?
george," Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, 
        maybe take in a shower fight.  Hey, you know you got a bounced 
        check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"
jerry," Yes, I know, I know."
george," I noticed you chose the ""clowns with balloons"" check 
        design."
jerry," It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones."
elaine," Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and 
        Kramer."
kramer," Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs."
kurt," Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh."
kramer," Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. &lt;Kramer gets up to leave by 
        climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor, 
        then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked 
        in his collar.&gt;"
jerry, Is he from the future?
elaine," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy."
george," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about 
        guts. &lt;Points to his head.&gt; <i>This</i> is guts."
elaine, What? Clinging to some scraps?
george," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains 
        of a once great society of hair."
elaine," Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced 
        a clown check!"
jerry," Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino."
marcelino, People seem to like the clowns.
marcelino, 'Kay.
marcelino," Sorry, no. It's store policy."
jerry, But it's your bodega.
marcelino, Even <i>I</i> am not above the policy.
betsy, Those are our tennis courts.
george," Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang 
        fights?"
betsy," There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security 
        facility."
george," Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?"
betsy, No.
betsy," And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks 
        to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian."
celia, Nice to meet you.
betsy, I'll be in my office if you need me.
george," Thanks, Warden."
celia," So, are you the head of the foundation?"
george," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. &lt;Notices 
        another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.&gt; So uh, you 
        two shop at the same store?"
celia," No, it's standard issue."
george, Oh my God...you're in jail? &lt;Celia nods.&gt; That is so cool!
jerry, You asked her out?
george," Well...not ""out."" She's in prison."
jerry, How could you ask her out?
george, Why not?
jerry," I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens 
        because you didn't want to go over the bridge!"
george, That was different! 
jerry, I'll say.
george," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the 
        time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear 
        of the pop-in?"
george," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I 
        saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really 
        well..."
jerry, Conjugal visit?
kramer, Hey. What's up?
jerry, George is dating a convict.
kramer, Oh? What's she in for?
george, Embezzlement.
jerry," Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?"
kramer," Well, not here. &lt;Goes into the hallway, comes back in with 
        a huge bag of chicken feed.&gt;"
jerry," Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?"
kramer," Well, it's chicken feed. &lt;Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.&gt; 
      "
jerry, I sense something is afoot.
george, Allow me. Why?
kramer," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs."
jerry," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?"
kurt," Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch. &lt;Tosses his wallet to Elaine, 
        she pays the delivery guy.&gt;"
kurt, What? 
elaine," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was."
kurt," Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked 
        the way it looked, so I kept it."
elaine," Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under 
        it? &lt;Kurt shrugs.&gt;"
jerry," Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?"
kramer," Oh, Jerry loves the morning."
jerry, Who?
kramer, Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
jerry," Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is <i>not</i> a chicken."
kramer, Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
jerry," Well, you picked out a rooster."
kramer," Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production."
celia, This was fun.
george, Yeah. I had a great time.
guard," Five minutes, Mr. Costanza."
george, The whole hour just flew by. &lt;Begins cleaning up the table.&gt;
guard, I'll get that.
george," Oh, thanks, Bobby.  Well, I guess I'll see you in four 
        days."
celia," Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here 
        for you."
george, Of course you will. You're the best.
jerry, Hello?
jerry, I'm not having money problems.
helen," Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into 
        advertising."
morty, He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
jerry, I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! &lt;George enters.&gt;
helen, That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.
jerry, You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
helen," We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope."
morty, I don't see envelopes!
helen," They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... &lt;She 
        puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.&gt;"
jerry, Ma! Ma! MA! &lt;Hangs up the phone in disgust.&gt;
george, How're the folks?
jerry, Good.
george, So? Movie tonight?
jerry, I thought you were going out with Celia.
george," I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!"
jerry, Having her in jail.
george," The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with 
        this now."
jerry," Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it."
elaine," Here. &lt;Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.&gt; Take a 
        look at that."
jerry, Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
elaine," No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. &lt;George 
        overhears and stands up, concerned.&gt;"
jerry, So he just shaves his head for no reason?
george, That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
elaine," And he's growing it in just for me.  It's mine. It's 
        all mine."
jerry, It's just hair.
elaine, It's not just hair! Look! &lt;Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.&gt;
jerry, It's brown.
elaine, It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
jerry, So?
elaine," You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's 
        hair is. &lt;They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and 
        struggling to keep his composure.&gt; I'm sorry, George, but it's true."
marcelino," Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?"
kramer," Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld."
marcelino, Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? 
kramer," Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?"
marcelino," Sorry Kramer, can't help you."
elaine," Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little 
        seedlings here. Huh..."
kurt, What?
elaine," Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here."
kurt, What do you mean? &lt;Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.&gt;
elaine," Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head 
        for?"
elaine, Huh.
kurt, Oh my God! &lt;Steps into the doorway&gt; I'm going bald! 
celia, George! I'm so glad to see you!
george," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something 
        nice."
celia, Good news - I'm up for parole.
george, Parole! &lt;Feigning joy&gt; That's dynamite!
jerry, So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
kramer," Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight."
jerry, Great! &lt;realizing&gt; What?
kramer," Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store."
jerry, Ah ha...
kramer," So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down."
jerry," Kramer, cockfighting is illegal."
kramer, Only in The United States.
jerry, It's inhumane!
kramer," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is."
jerry, It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
kramer, What?
jerry, Yeah!
kramer," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like 
        ""American Gladiators."""
jerry," No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt."
kramer," Well, I left him with Marcelino!"
kramer, My Little Jerry! &lt;Runs out.&gt;
jerry," Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?"
kramer," Well, he's more than O.K., he won!"
jerry, You let him fight?
kramer," I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have 
        seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! 
        He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even 
        have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight 
        lasted two seconds."
jerry, How long do they usually last?
kramer," Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down 
        today."
jerry, Great!
kramer, Hey.
george, Celia's up for parole.
kramer," Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight."
george, What?
kramer, Who?
jerry, I'm too tired.
jerry, Alright. &lt;Kramer leaves.&gt;
jerry," Ah, I'm so sorry."
george," She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make 
        up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. &lt;Rubs his forehead.&gt; Talking..."
jerry," In other words, a normal relationship."
george," And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all 
        seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go."
jerry," Well, she'll still be an ex-con."
george, It's not the same. 
jerry," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll 
        pick her up on something."
elaine, Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
kurt, I don't care.
elaine," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt."
kurt, Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
elaine, You already ate?
kurt, It's from yesterday.
marcelino, Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
jerry, Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
marcelino, Now we have a new deal.
jerry, New deal?
marcelino," When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours."
jerry, This is outrageous!  Pack of Juicy Fruit.
jerry, 85 cents? <i>That</i> is outrageous!
jerry," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld. 
      "
kramer," Well, that's out of the question."
jerry," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity."
kramer," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!"
jerry," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the 
        cockfighter and be done with it!"
kramer," You know, I think you're jealous."
jerry, Of what?
jerry," Kramer, give me that rooster!"
kramer," Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than 
        you ever will! Yah-yah! &lt;Kramer leaves.&gt;"
betsy," George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever 
        you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled. "
george," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. 
        Very smart. Very...crafty. "
betsy, Does she have any plans after she's released?
george," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together 
        with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them, 
        you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. "
marcelino, Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
jerry, Kramer won't sell.
marcelino," Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your 
        check anyway."
jerry," Well, thank you, Marcelino."
marcelino," Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day 
        is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's 
        main event."
jerry, You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
marcelino," Shhh, not so loud."
jerry," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive."
marcelino," Can, too!"
jerry," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down 
        for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please 
        leave."
jerry," We'll see about that. &lt;Runs to the window and shouts up to 
        Kramer, who's on the roof.&gt; Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight 
        to win!"
kramer, O.K.!
kurt, Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
kurt," Oh, God."
george," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. "
kurt, Happy? Why should I be happy?
george," You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances 
        beyond this perimeter - &lt;points at Kurt's head with a pen&gt; - then 
        you won't be Kurt anymore."
kurt, Who will I be?
kurt, How long do I have?
kurt, Is there anything I can do?
george," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was 
        the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. &lt;There's 
        a knock at the door.&gt; Excuse me."
george, Celia? What are you doing here?
celia," Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out. "
elaine, Kurt!
kurt," Elaine...&lt;holds out a wedding ring&gt; Will you marry me? &lt;Elaine 
        is shocked.&gt;"
kramer," Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?"
jerry," Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. &lt;Kramer picks 
        up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.&gt; Little Jerry is lean, mean, 
        peckin' machine! &lt;Kramer starts filling a pot with water.&gt; What 
        are you doing with that?"
kramer," I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little 
        Jerry."
jerry," Hey, Kramer...?"
jerry," Be careful. &lt;George enters.&gt; Hey, guess what! Little Jerry 
        ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!"
george, Is that good?
jerry, I don't know. Where have you been?
george," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows 
        up at the door!"
jerry, Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
george," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even 
        better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime 
        -"
elaine," Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I 
        mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" 
        time..."
kurt," Plus, you want to get to know me."
elaine," Yeah, yeah, that too."
kurt," Well, how much time?"
elaine, I don't know...a year?
kurt," No, no, no...it has to be now."
elaine, Could I see the ring again?
elaine," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. 
        Those'll be good times."
jerry," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change."
elaine," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. 
        What am I clinging to? &lt;George comes over.&gt;"
george," Hey, sorry I'm late. "
jerry, Where's Celia?
george," She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. &lt;Kramer 
        comes over with Little Jerry.&gt;"
jerry," Hey, how's he doin'?"
kramer," He's got a big sweat going. &lt;Takes an envelope out of his 
        pocket.&gt; Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents."
kramer," There's Marcelino. &lt;Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge 
        white rooster.&gt;"
jerry, Look at the size of his bird!
kramer, That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
kurt," Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank 
        him, he changed my life."
celia," No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet."
kurt," Ah, damn. "
celia," Aw, man!"
jerry, He's a ringer!
george," Where's the tamale guy? &lt;The bell rings, and the cockfight 
        begins.&gt;"
kramer," Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him 
        outta there. "
jerry, Kramer!
elaine, Stop the fight!
elaine, Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
kurt," They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little 
        time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him."
elaine," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?"
kurt," Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?"
elaine," So, 10 to 14 months."
kurt, Yeah.
broadcasted," February 6, 1997 for the first time."
stars," Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, "
,
ellen," So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, 
              and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time 
              you have left to live."
jerry," So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're 
              pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you 
              this thing was good!"
ellen,  I can't believe this is our first date.
jerry, I know.. How about dessert?
ellen, I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..
jerry, Why?
ellen, Today's my birthday.
jerry, What? Today? Really?
ellen, Yeah.
,
george," So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was 
              her birthday?"
jerry, Yeah. And she picked the day!
george, Is she socially awkward?
jerry," No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
george," Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the 
              Monday after the weekend."
jerry, She's not Lincoln.
kramer, Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
jerry, I'll pass.
kramer," Oh, yeah? Huh.  Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, 
              yum!"
george," Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing 
              high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship."
jerry, Does it ever bother you that this organization-
george, Nope!
jerry, is beating the bushes-
george, Nope! 
jerry, to basically give this money away-
george, Noo!
jerry," to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?"
george,"  I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine 
              I say! "
,
george," Quick, what's your favorite animal?"
george,  A frog?
george,  Frog is wrong.
george,"  I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, 
              why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? 
              It'd save you a lot of trouble."
george,"  Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know."
george,  I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
george," so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club."
steven, State champs.
george, Who's your favorite chess player?
steven,  Nastercoff?
george," Right.  Nastercoff.. What country is he from, 
              again?"
steven,"  I don't know.. I made it up.  
              I'm never gonna get this thing."
george,"  Woah, woah, woah! What are you 
              telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. 
              "
steven, I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
,
elaine," So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do 
              some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. 
              He's gonna let me ghost write it."
jerry," Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone 
              to ghost read it."
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
elaine, Hey!
kramer," Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice 
              of the fixin's bar.. garlic,  and what-not.. mmm,"
jerry," The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President 
              Martin Van Buren?"
kramer," Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make 
              a move to the door, you know,  they block it! So, 
              I lunged for the bathroom."
elaine, What? What happened?
kramer," Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like 
              this  I'm only showing 
              eight fingers."
jerry," Well, what does that mean?"
kramer," That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth 
              President..  They thought I was a former Van 
              B. Boy!"
,
ellen,"  Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just 
              want to check my messages.. "
melissa, Ellen.
ellen," Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. "
melissa," Ohh, we've heard a lot about you!  It 
              is so sweet of you to take her out."
kim," Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this."
jerry,  She coming of a bad break-up?
kim,  No.
melissa, See ya!
jerry, Any messages?
ellen," Yeah, no one called."
,
jerry," They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out 
              with her."
george," So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone 
              that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. "
jerry, There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
george, Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
jerry," No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
george,"  Hey, I htink I may have found someone 
              for the scholarship."
jerry, Yeah?
george," I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. 
              finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes 
              sports.. watches T.V.."
jerry, Is he smart?
george,"  He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing 
              an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture."
jerry, Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
george," Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be 
              everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry."
jerry, I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
,
elaine," Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place 
              isn't quite what I imagined.. "
peterman, Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. 
elaine," Well,  what part of your life  
              do you want to start with? Foreign"
peterman," Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue 
              ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day 
              life."
elaine, Oh. 
peterman,"  
              Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally 
              memorized them."
elaine," Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.."
peterman,  2.. CBS..
elaine," get, um, started.."
peterman," 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview 
              channel?"

              ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book 
              here."
peterman," well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do 
              you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?"
elaine," You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place 
              by the Van Buren Boys?"
peterman,  You don't say.
elaine," Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally 
              flashed their secret gang sign."
peterman," Well, that's pretty exciting.  Let's put that 
              in the book."
elaine," But, that didn't happen to you."
peterman," So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman."
elaine," No, I - I really don't think you can do that."
peterman,"  Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy 
              plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. "
elaine, You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
,
jerry, Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
ellen," No, this is brand new. Do you like it?"
jerry," Actually, yeah.  Wait a second! Is that the fork 
              that fell on the floor?!  Are you using the fork that 
              fell on the floor?!"
ellen,"  No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one."
jerry, I guess that's all right.
ellen," Is something wrong, Jerry?"
jerry," No, absolutely nothing.  You're fantastic! 
               Hey guys!"
george, Hey.
jerry,"  Kramer, George, this is Ellen."
,
george," Ladies and gentlemen, this  is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that 
              meaty part of the curve -"
wyck," George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose 
              to be.. largely academic."
george," I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized 
              tests.."
wyck, These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
george," Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He 
              wants to be  an architect."
wyck, Is that right?
steven," Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher."
george,"  Steven, nothing is higher than an architect."
steven," I think I'd really like to be a city planner.  Why limit myself to just 
              one building, when I can design a"
wyck," Well, that's a good point."
george,"  No, it's not."
steven," Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with 
              a tilty desk, and a big ruler? "
george,  It's called a T-square.
wyck," You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect 
              - after he flunked out of dental school!  
              Contratulations,"
steven, Thank you.
wyck, Susan would be proud of what you're doing.
steven, Thank you.

kramer," And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th 
              President, was the man they most admired."
peterman,"  Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good 
              yarn.. "
kramer," You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you 
              looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? "
elaine," No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -"
peterman,"  How much would you take for the whole 
              lot?"
kramer, My whole lot?
peterman," Name your price, man!"
kramer,  1500 dollars.
peterman, I'll give you half that.
kramer,  Done!
peterman," Kramer, my friend,  consider Elaine 
              at your disposal."

              evenings.. "
,
elaine," Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano 
              story?!"
kramer," Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then 
              and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off 
              to the store."
elaine, What happened to Bob Saccamano?
kramer," Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.  
              So I'm waiting for the"
elaine," Alright, well, now that's something.."
kramer," Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but 
              the next think I knew.. "
elaine,  A train is bearing down on you?!
kramer," No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants 
              I was about to return."
elaine,"  I don't understand.. you were wearing 
              the pants you were returning?"
kramer," Well, I guess I was.."
elaine,  What were you gonna wear on the way back?
kramer," Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there!  
              All right, next story.."
elaine," Alright, I think I got enough for one day."
kramer," Yeah, yeah, chew on that."
elaine,"  Yeah, I'll chew on that."
kramer," Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together 
              tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.."
elaine," Oh, thanks. I've got plans."
kramer," Elaine, you should be there to document it."
elaine,"  Oh, you're getting together with 
              some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?"
kramer," Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple 
              a chance to loosen up."
,
jerry," So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants 
              to be a city planner?"
george," I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's 
              one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh 
              and blood. Like my"
jerry," You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.  Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. 
              we're all set for the weekend."
george, You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
jerry,"  Vermont!  
              With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if 
              we want to! (George is"
george,  You want to start?
kramer,"  Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get 
              my thoughts together."
george," Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough."
jerry, What?!
kramer,"  Jerry, she's a loser. "
jerry, Where is this coming from? She's great!
george,"  Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? 
              Things will pick up."
jerry, There's nothing wrong with my career!
kramer,"  Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive 
              training program for him."
george, I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
kramer," Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider."
george," Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!"
kramer," Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated."
jerry,"  Alright! Excuse me!  I'm not buying any 
              of this!"
kramer," All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, 
              everybody's wrong but you!"
jerry," You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy 
              wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!"
kramer, Which one?
jerry, They were all like that!
,
steven," Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?"
george," Well, Steven, I, uh.. "

              Real au jus sauce!"
elaine,  I'll make a note of it.
kramer, Yeah?
kramer," Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, 
              and I suddenly realized that I- "
elaine, You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
kramer, What do ya mean?
elaine, You signed the release.
kramer, Yeah.
elaine, He sat in mud. Not you.
kramer, But I did sit in mud.
elaine,  Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!

              but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind."

jerry, Is my toaster oven on there?
elaine, How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?

elaine, Yes! I'm a writer.
jerry, Make them interesting.
elaine, Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
jerry," Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents."
elaine, What? Wheren't they just here?
jerry," Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where 
              to turn! I gotta see what they think of her."
elaine, Maybe we could all have dinner later?
jerry," I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right 
              back tonight."
kramer," Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're 
              gonna love this story!  So, I line up my 
              cold cuts on the couch"

kramer, Damn!
jerry, What?
kramer," Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but 
              they all stink!"

kramer, Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! 
,
elaine," Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?"
peterman," Well, it started out nicely ""I'm returning some 
              pants."" A very identifiable problem..  ""I 
              set of down a train tunnel.""..  But that's"

              see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into 
              a side tunnel - and you run into a"
peterman," It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting 
              writing."

              from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall 
              in some mud, and.. ruin your"

              as a reference?"
peterman," Nonsense!  I have Benes' woderfully imaginative

george," Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy."
jerry, That's good stuff.
george, I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
jerry, Can you grab a nap at work.
george," Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd 
        love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. 
        I'll see ya'."
elaine, Bye.
jerry, So what are you doing now?
elaine, I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
jerry, With a gentleman caller?
elaine," Yes, his name is Hal."
jerry," The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right 
        at the other -person."
elaine, It's the next best thing to being alone.
jerry, Shower?
kramer," No, pool. I just swam 200 laps. "
elaine, You are kidding.
kramer," Look at hose babies . They're prunes. I saw Conrad going 
        up to oyur place."
elaine," Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that 
        coming?"
jerry," A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little 
        decision."
elaine," Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?"
elaine, What exactly was that kid?
kramer," Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid."
wilhelm," Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It 
        is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo."
hal, 
elaine, Well I don't care. It was delicious.
elaine, Wanna sit down?
hal," Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back."
elaine, Really?
hal," I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very 
        careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store. "
elaine," Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, ""Back 
        in "", or ""Good Vertibrations""."

        underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?"

george," It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work 
        after dinner, do you?"

        than my bed at home."

george, Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
kramer, got problems Jerry.
jerry, What happened?
kramer," Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real 
        grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics 
        Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through 
        a flabby armed spanking machine."
jerry, How long did that last?
kramer," A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a 
        little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't 
        hold me, Jerry."
jerry, How was the movie?
elaine," I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of 
        that guy. "
jerry," Why?<br/>
        ELAINE He's got a back problem."
jerry, So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
elaine, After one date!
kramer," What's that guy's last name again?<br/>
        ELAINE Kitzmiller."
kramer," Oh, that's right."
jerry, So what are you going to do with the mattress?
elaine, I don't know. Chuck it?
kramer," Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's 
        see if it will fit in my bedroom."
elaine," Oh, all right."
kramer, My old one sprung a leak.

conrad," Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working 
        all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways."
jerry, How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
conrad, Couple of questions for you.
jerry," No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get 
        it done."
conrad, All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.
jerry, Just . . . do it.

        seen Costanza?"
secretary, I've seen him around. 
steinbrenner," Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get 
        it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. ""She's a heart 
        breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh"" . . .very catchy. You know what? 
        I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful 
        people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?"
hal," Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Ii intended."
elaine," Well, what did you intend, Hal?"
hal," I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's 
        why I had the mattress custom designed for you."
elaine, Custom designed?
hal," They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. 
        I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?"
elaine," Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me."
hal, So you do like the mattress?
elaine," Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it."
father," Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives. "
son," Hey, there's a man swimming in the water."

        kills someone they through the body in the river."
kramer, Jer.
jerry, Hi.
kramer," Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself 
        miles and miles of open lanes."
jerry, What is that smell?
kramer, That's East River.
jerry," You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked 
        overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?"
kramer, Technically Norfolk  has more gross tonnage.
jerry, How could you swim in that water?
kramer, I saw a couple of other guys out there.
jerry, Swimming?
kramer," Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there."
elaine,"  Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress 
        back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All 
        right, bye."
elaine," Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh! "
steinbrenner," What is it with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half 
        hours. Should I go? No way Jack! , I'll tell you that."
seconrad, Mr. Steinbrenner?
steinbrenner, That's what they call me.
seconrad, Your grandchildren are here to see you.
steinbrenner," Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in.  
        little people .. pony express  wow, "

george," Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away."
xx," Hi, I'm Brady."
george, ?? get away??
jerry, Why don't you just have him paged?
george, Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
jerry, A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
george, Just CALL!
jerry, I should have some reason.
steinbrenner," Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER 
        a bell, ""Heartbreaker , . . . """
seconrad," Mr. Steinbrenner we just received a call. There's a bomb in 
        the building."
steinbrenner," A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under 
        the desk."
steinbrenner," Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw 
        there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies."
george, I'm sorry sir.
steinbrenner," You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb 
        ahead of time."
george, What?
steinbrenner," ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because 
        you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. 
        Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable 
        hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear."
elaine," Jerry, Jerry."
jerry, Yeah.
elaine, What the hell is this? Where are you?
jerry, Over here. You can see right through here.
elaine, What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
jerry, It's kind of cozy.
elaine," Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. 
        . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my 
        mattress."
jerry, Does it smell like the East River?
elaine, How did you know? 
jerry," Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough 
        bridge and the Brooklyn bridge."
elaine," Oh, GREAT! "
kramer," Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again."
elaine," Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks."
kramer," Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. 
        I think it might be polluted."
george," Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What 
        the hell happened here?"
elaine, Hi.
george, Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
elaine," It is obtrusive, isn't it?"
kramer, It is very obtrusive.
jerry, I don't think it's that bad.
kramer, You can't get a stool in here.
jerry, No the stools go over there.
kramer," No, that's no good. I'm leaving."
elaine, I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
george," Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?<br/>
        JERRY You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool."
george, Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
jerry, Hey look at you.
george," Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 
        DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT."
jerry, No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
george," ??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL 
        STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING."
jerry, Could you at least get a hat for me?
george, FINE? WHAT SIZE?
jerry, Seven and five eighths
george, SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
jerry, Why are you shouting?
george, I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
hal, So are you liking the mattress?
elaine," I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  
        get going."
hal, What is that smell?
elaine, What smell?
hal, I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
elaine," No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other 
        day and I forgot to hose off my boots. "
hal, Claming?
elaine," Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop."
steinbrenner," Yes, yes, come in."
george," Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call 
        back here."
steinbrenner," Just let me ask you something. Is it ""February"" 
        or "" February""? Because I prefer ""Febuary"" and what 
        is this ""ru""? "
george, Let me put that on speaker phone.
steinbrenner, Hello are you the bomber?
jerry, Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
steinbrenner, Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
jerry, think I've changed my mind.
steinbrenner," You don't want them, then goodbye."
george," Good thinking, sir."
steinbrenner, Well what do you want instead?
jerry, What?
steinbrenner," Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something."
jerry," I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders 
        if the game was going to be rained out."
steinbrenner," All right George, you can handle that."
steinbrenner, Costanza what the hell are you doing?
george," You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the 
        phone."
steinbrenner," When someone's unstable, you don't stir the fat, George! 
        You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around 
        the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And 
        I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous."
elaine, Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
hal, It's just more cheese.
elaine," I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places 
        to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!"
kramer," Oh, hey, "
elaine," Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal."
kramer," Hal, .. uh Langerhans."
hal, Kitzmiller.
kramer," Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right"
elaine, You feeling jiff?
kramer," Oh, I'm jiff."
hal, That smell
kramer," Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really 
        bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and 
        I'll get it back to you as soon as I can."
elaine," Oh, baby."
george, Lunch.
hal, Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
kramer," Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . . "
hal, Kitzmiller.
kramer, That's it.
hal, You and Elaine are pretty close.
kramer," Oh, we go back a ways."
hal," And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?"
kramer, That's right. 
hal, But this isn't still going on.
kramer," No, no. She put a stop to that. "
hal, That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
kramer," Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the 
        back."
hal, Great for the back. Right.
kramer," Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup. 
      "
steinbrenner," ""Heatbreaker, Brewbaker, "" Hey George, 
        I remember that tune. George? George? Um, what's that ticking. Oh oh. 
        Oh, oooh,wo wo wo wo .  fire in the hole!"
elaine," I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, 
        oh, okay, . . ."
conrad, You want it back the way it was?
jerry," Yeah, that's right."
conrad," You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. 
        The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision."
jerry, One second. Hello.
elaine, Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
jerry, Just lie down.
elaine," I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta 
        go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me."
jerry," All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go."
conrad," Stay, go whatever. "
hal," Hey, Kramer."
kramer, What's going on?
hal," I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. 
        He recommended it to all his patients. "
kramer, He just sunk like a stone.
george," Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter."
steinbrenner," Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing 
        with you. All right boys send it in"
steinbrenner," What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's 
        check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those 
        drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, 
        eh, Georgie? "
steinbrenner," Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay 
        boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more 
        desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER. "
kramer," Hey, watch where you're kicking!"
elaine, Kramer.
kramer, Elaine
elaine," I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
kramer, Yeah.
elaine, Yeah.
george," Hi Connie, Jerry around?"
conrad," No, and I prefer ""Conrad"". So I heard what happened 
        to the desk. "
george, There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
conrad," Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'"
jerry," Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't 
        believe I got the Low Fat!"
george," So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday."
marcy, Why?
george, I was naked.
marcy," Oh, George."
jerry, I saw it.
marcy, How'd he look?
jerry, Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
marcy," You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease 
              in the hot tub."
george, Really? What happened?
marcy," Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right 
              back. "
jerry," I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada."""
george," Is ""yada yada"" bad?"
jerry," No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct."
george, She is succinct.
jerry," Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. "
george, Hey.
jerry," Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley."
george," Yeah, dentist of the stars."
jerry, What's up?
tim, I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
jerry, Excuse me?
tim, I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
jerry, Well...  Welcome aboard.
tim, Thanks.
george," Hey, where you just at the health club?"
tim," Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, 
              it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. "
jerry," Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish 
              jokes."
elaine," So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get 
              drunk the first night."
jerry, Booze is not a religion.
elaine," Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner 
              called me."
jerry," Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage."
elaine," What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months 
              ago. She's already remarried."
jerry, I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
elaine," Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a 
              reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. 
              "
kramer," Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or 
              Mickey?"
mickey," We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt 
              we'll look like idiots."
elaine," Hmm, turn around.  Both so striking."
kramer, Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
elaine," How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? 
              "
marcy," So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada 
              yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial."
george, What a succinct story.
marcy, I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.
george," Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's."
marcy, Are you close with your parents?
george," Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada..."
marcy, Yada what?
george, Yada yada yada...
karen,"  
              I like your shirt."
mickey," Oh, thank you. It's 100% cotton, and some wool."
kramer," Well, you too seem to have the same taste."
julie," Well I like it, too."
kramer, Well I have the same shirt.
mickey," Yeah, well I'm wearin' it."
julie, I like your shirt too.
karen," Oh, so do I."
kramer, Oh. 
waiter," Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps."
mickey, I like Merlot.
karen, I love Merlot.
julie, I'm crazy about Merlot.
kramer, I live for Merlot.
waiter, We're out of Merlot.
agent," So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?"
elaine," Oh, yeah, yeah."
agent, Do you socialize with them often?
elaine," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well 
              sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff."
agent, Oh.
elaine," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. 
              Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've 
              seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, 
              and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" 
              I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're 
              nice people. "
george," Oh, you're in here."
jerry, What're you doing here?
george, I knew you had an appointment.
jerry, Well this is very awkward.
george," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am 
              loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole 
              life story. "
jerry," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth."
george," Hey, what this thing? Whew!"
jerry," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. 
              "
george," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to 
              make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?"
jerry, George...
tim, Um...
george," Fine, I'll make an appointment. "
tim," All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds 
              me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? 
              Huh?"
jerry, Hey.
tim, Those aren't mahtzah balls.
jerry," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?"
tim," Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?"
jerry," I know, but..."
tim," Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people 
              for 3000 years."
jerry, 5000.
tim," 5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of 
              flouride."
jerry, And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
elaine, Why are you so concerned about this?
jerry," I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to 
              Judaism just for the jokes. "
phone," Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York 
              Times?"
jerry, Yes. 
kramer, I don't believe that.
mickey," If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've 
              figured this whole thing out."
kramer, Why were you holding the door open for?
mickey, Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
kramer," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was 
              wrong!"
mickey, Let's just put they're names in a hat.
kramer," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just 
              take the one that was on the left?"
mickey, I'm not sure she was my type.
kramer," Oh, everybody's your type."
mickey, What the hell does that mean?
kramer, You've been married three times.
mickey," That's it, it's go time! "
jerry," All right, take it easy."
elaine," Hey, hey, hey!"
kramer," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!"
elaine," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. 
              Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across 
              from each other, and see who the girls sit next to."
mickey, That's not bad.
kramer," All right, so we let the girls decide."
mickey," Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?"
kramer," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time."
mickey," No, no one wears the shirt next time."
kramer," That's right, 'cause they already saw it."
mickey, We'll look like idiots. 
george," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the 
              wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single."
marcy, So what's she doing now?
george, Yada.
marcy," Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, 
              and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today."
elaine," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?"
arnie, Well our adoption application was denied.
elaine, Really.
beth," The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              temper."
elaine, Oh.
beth," So we're just asking our friends what they may have said 
              to the adoption agent."
elaine," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are 
              and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it."
jerry, How you doing?
father, I have a discomfort in my molar. 
tim," Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in?  Father 
              Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about 
              the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. 
              "
jerry, Whatley. 
kramer, What are they doing here?
mickey, I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
kramer," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?"
mickey," All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one 
              do you want?"
kramer," All right, I'll take Julie."
mickey, I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
kramer," All right, I'll take Karen."
mickey," No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen."
kramer," All right, which one is Julie?  Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. 
              "
jerry," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, 
              I used to be Catholic."""
elaine," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's 
              more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the 
              buoys.  Bouys!"
jerry," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling 
              immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he 
              ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him."
elaine, So what're you gonna do?
jerry," I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear 
              what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch."
elaine,"  Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought 
              you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye."
jerry," They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to 
              lunch?"
elaine, Thought it would be nice.
jerry, Poor Beth.
elaine," Hey, Arnie's just as upset."
jerry, Oh screw him! 
george," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend 
              was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired 
              today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex."
elaine,  I've yada yada'd sex.
george, Really?
elaine," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the 
              lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never 
              heard from him again."
jerry, But you yada yada'd over the best part.
elaine," No, I mentioned the bisk."
george," Well, I gotta do somethin'. "
kramer," Well, I gotta do somethin'."
jerry, George is already in there.
kramer,"  No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You 
              know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself."
jerry, I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
kramer," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be 
              Karen."
george, Well it was a helluva yada yada.
marcy," He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was 
              just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--"
george," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. 
              Just give me the full story."
marcy, Okay.
george, Tell me about the free facial.
marcy," Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped 
              by a large department store."
george, Which one?
marcy, Bloomingdale's.
george, Very good. Go on.
marcy," Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch."
george, What's that?
marcy," And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs 
              to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and 
              skipped out on the bill."
george, Shoplifting.
marcy," Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. 
              What was the rest of that? "
jerry," Excuse me, Mother?"
nun, Sister.
jerry," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office 
              hours?"
nun, Well not until tomorrow.
jerry," Hmm, I really need to speak with him."
father, That's a kneeler.
jerry, Oh. 
father," Tell me your sins, my son."
jerry, Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
father, That's no sin.
jerry," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. 
              I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes."
father, And this offends you as a Jewish person.
jerry," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you 
              that he's also telling Catholic jokes."
father, Well.
jerry," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch 
              in a lifeboat."
father, I haven't heard that one.
jerry," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada 
              yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys.""  Father..."
father," One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I 
              could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom 
              teeth removed."
jerry," You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't 
              you?"
father, Um...
jerry, Newer magazines.
father, Now if you'll excuse me. 
george," Jerry, I gotta talk to you."
kramer, Hi.
karen," Hi, Kramer."
kramer, Got a minute?
karen," Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to 
              meet them?"
kramer, Sure.
karen,"  Mom, Dad."
kramer, Hi.
arnie," Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened 
              down there?"
elaine," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah 
              blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, 
              bleh bleh bleh...."
arnie," All right, shut up!"
elaine, Again you are telling me to shut up?
arnie, What?
elaine," You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not 
              getting the baby."
arnie, Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?
elaine," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll 
              make sure that it all gets worked out."
arnie," All right, just don't screw it up this time! "
elaine," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling."
jerry,"  Oh, are you about done?"
tim," I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with 
              newer magazines."
jerry, Huh?
tim, Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
jerry, What about all your Jewish jokes?
tim," I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my 
              people have been through."
jerry, The Jews?
tim," No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate 
              of any profession?"
jerry, Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
kramer," So, I'll uh... all right. "
jerry, Date with Karen?
kramer," No, Julie. She's the one."
jerry, What happened to Karen?
kramer," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know 
              her parents are little people?"
jerry," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people 
              children?"
kramer," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, 
              Jerry."
jerry," So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It 
              got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got 
              all offended. Those people can be so touchy."
kramer," Those people, listen to yourself."
jerry, What?
kramer," You think that dentists are so different from me and you? 
              They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of 
              a dream."
jerry," Kramer, he's just a dentist."
kramer," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."
jerry, I am not an anti-dentite!
kramer," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes 
              and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're 
              saying they should have their own schools."
jerry, They do have their own schools!
kramer, Yeah!
elaine," One little baby, whatever you have in stock."
agent, Miss Benes...
elaine," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. 
              Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun 
              way."
beth," Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd 
              be there for me."
jerry," Well, what's wrong?"
beth, I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
jerry, Talk to me.
beth," He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he 
              yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?"
jerry," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody."
beth, But we just got married.
jerry," Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about 
              Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on."
beth, Why would Elaine do that to me?
jerry," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big 
              hug. "
mickey, Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
jerry, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
mickey, Karen and I are getting married.
jerry," Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart."
mickey,  How many is that for you?
beth, Two.
mickey," You're a lightweight. Come on, honey."
elaine, Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
jerry, Beth and Arnie broke up.
elaine, So they don't want a baby?
jerry,  Pff.
elaine,  I think I'm gonna be sick. 
jerry," Hey, where's Marcy?"
george," She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, 
              yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. "
jerry," Hey, Kramer, over here."
kramer, I just assume not sit next to you.
jerry," Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents."
elaine, Nice looking family.
jerry, Very handsome.
kramer,  How ya doing?
julie," Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. "
jerry," Hi, Mr. Abbott."
beth, What was that all about?
jerry," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all 
              out of proportion."
beth," Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?"
jerry, What?
beth, A dentist. 
jerry, That's a good one. Dentists.
beth," Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. 
              "
elaine, Where's Beth?
jerry, She went out to get her head shaved.
father," We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... 
              matrimony."
jerry, Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
father," Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... 
              Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. "
karen,  I really wanted you.
cast,
jerry, Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
man, Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
george, Yeah. No problem.
jerry, Let's go.
george," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag."
jerry, For how long?
george, I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
jerry, Come on.
george, Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
george, Where are you going?
jerry, I'm going to be this guy's friend.
jerry, New clothes?
george, Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping.  Can I borrow your menu?
jerry," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks 
              of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!"
george, The guy never came back.
jerry, He asked you to watch them not wear them.
george, I'm still watching them.
jerry, You look like a tourist.
george," All right, let me ask you something When do you start 
              to worry about ear hair?"
jerry, When you hear like a soft russeling.
george," It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, 
              knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do 
              you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting 
              there."
jerry," Oh right, the new job, how is it?"
george," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm."
jerry, So who's the new you?
george," They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name 
              is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school."
jerry, Oh hi Alex.
alex, I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?
jerry, No.
alex, I'll be right back.
george," Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the 
              bus at the port authority?"
jerry," Right here, George. In here.  Try 
              opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world."
george, Thanks. Thanks a lot.
kramer, Hey.
elaine, Hey.
kramer, Hi.
elaine, Where's Jerry?
kramer, Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
elaine, No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
kramer, Well let's sit down.
elaine," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling 
              Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to 
              you?"
kramer, Vaguely.
elaine," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, 
              I put them in the book anyway."
kramer, You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
elaine," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter."
kramer," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. 
              I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman."
elaine, He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
kramer, Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
kramer," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks."
jerry,  Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
kramer," All right, let's go."
elaine," Mr. Lippman, how are you?"
elaine, What are you doing here?
elaine, Oh.
kramer, Hey buddy. Remember me?
kramer," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?"
woman, Who are you?
kramer, I'm the real Peterman.
kramer," Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat 
              and giggley."
woman, I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
elaine, That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
elaine," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, 
              it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of  does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million 
              dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops."
kramer," I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're 
              hurting my elbow."
george, Well actually I'm...
george," Little Rock, Arkensas."
jerry, Hmm. That looks new.
kramer," So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject 
              me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac."
jerry,  Yeah that's too bad.
kramer, What's the matter with you?
jerry,  Nothing.
kramer," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's 
              wrong. What is it."
jerry, I did something stupid.
kramer, What did you do?
jerry," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest 
              hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew,  Gone."
kramer," Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down 
              there."
jerry, Well women do it.
kramer,"  ""Well women do it."" I'll 
              tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you 
              can just  sashey your pretty little self around 
              the town square."
jerry, Well what am I going to tell Alex?
kramer," Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. 
              You hear me?"
jerry, Um hum.
kramer," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest."
jerry, Hey!
kramer, I forgot. Wait. Never mind. 
alex, How about the beach this weekend?
jerry," You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. 
              I mean it's hard enough..."
alex," All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, 
              I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much 
              smoother and cleaner."
jerry, Really?
elaine," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?"
elaine, Mr Lippman?
jerry, So you're pretending to be a tourist?
george," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around 
              here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town 
              visiting so there's no messy breakup"
jerry, How do you explain your apartment?
george, I got a hotel room.
jerry, you moved into a hotel?
george," Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going 
              to stay?"
jerry," So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for 
              this hairless dog."
george, So?
jerry," So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not 
              another."
george, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
jerry," Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those 
              low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest."
kramer,  Hey Jerry.
kramer,"  I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check 
              it out. Hahaha."
george, Reality tour?
jerry," The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is 
              reality."
elaine, This was my idea you stole my idea.
elaine," Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is 
              my air and my idea."
elaine, Peach.
george, Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
george, Willie. Yeah.
george, Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
jerry," You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you 
              all the time now."
george," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* 
              town."
jerry, What is it she think you can't do?
george, Find a job. Get an apartment.
jerry, How did you do those things?
george," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. 
              You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life 
              and condense it down into one day, it looks decent."
jerry," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?"
kramer," Here you go, here you go, check it out."
jerry," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused."
kramer," Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the 
              stories behind the stories."
jerry," Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally 
              unknown person's life."
kramer," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and 
              desert."
george, What's desert?
kramer," Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman 
              eats."
george, He eats those?
kramer, No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
george," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography 
              is not. Now, you Kramer are real. "
kramer, Talk to me.
george," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is 
              real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real 
              in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman 
              which is you."
kramer, Understand?
jerry, Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
elaine, So? What do you want me to do about it?
elaine," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, 
              I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you 
              in that paper hat and that aprin..."
elaine," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin 
              tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the 
              top, toss the stump. Taste."
elaine, Yeah.
elaine," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen."
elaine," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation 
              point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"""
kramer, Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
jerry, What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
kramer, What are you doing to yourself?
jerry, I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. 
kramer," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to 
              happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and 
              fuller and darker."
jerry, Oh that's an old wives tale.
kramer, Is it? Look at this.
kramer,"  Look at it! Look at it! And it's all 
              me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard."
jerry," Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen 
              to me."
kramer, Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
elaine, Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
rebecca," Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter."
elaine," Oh, hi."
rebecca," Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our 
              shelter?"
elaine, You been enjoying them?
rebecca, They're just stumps.
elaine, Well they're perfectly edible.
rebecca," Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, 
              they'll eat anything? "
rebecca," I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't 
              have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky 
              to get the stumps."
elaine," If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have 
              to eat them."
rebecca, The homeless don't like them.
elaine, Fine.
rebecca," We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, 
              ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?"" 
            "
elaine, We were just trying to help.
rebecca," Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster 
              shells."
elaine, I think I might.
george, $2300.
george, Yeah.
george," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. 
              Wait till you see the plum job that I landed."
kramer," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just 
              make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken 
              wire."
woman," Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing 
              those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic."
kramer,  Well that's your opinion.
kramer, Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
kramer," Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left 
              on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at 
              the same time."
jerry, Why do I have to go on the tour?
kramer," Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, 
              it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and 
              I'll only charge to 60 bucks."
jerry," Hey, how's business?"
elaine," Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department 
              won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff 
              until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps."
kramer," All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the 
              bus."
elaine," Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?"
kramer, Yeah.
elaine, You got any room on that thing?
kramer, Yeah there are a few seats still available.
elaine," Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll 
              make it worth your while."
kramer," Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back."
elaine, No they don't.
kramer, Are they war veterans?
george, Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... 
george, Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
alex," You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't 
              use cinnimon rasin."
jerry, You also shouldn't use a donut.
kramer," All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman 
              Reality Tour..."
jerry, Can we just go?
kramer, And go we will.
man,"   What is this, a pizza-pound cake?"
kramer," We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling 
              muffin stumps to the local repository."
kramer, And we're off.
jerry," You know I never though he would be able to recreate the 
              experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close."
man, Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
kramer, I was going to dump this.
man, It doesn't look like garbage.
kramer, Well it's muffin stumps
man, Where are the muffin tops?
kramer, This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
man, Can't do it.
kramer, Is this a joke?
man, That's what I'd like to know about it.
alex," You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you? "
jerry, What's that?
alex, Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.
jerry, Oh. Yeah. 
kramer,"  Well maybe I will take 
              it up with Consumer Affairs."
man, Where are we going?
kramer,"  I don't know.  Uh, 
              no more questions."
waitress," So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler 
              chicken."
george," Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink."
man," Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?"
george, What clothes?
man, These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
jerry,"  Kramer how much longer? 
              My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I 
              can't let her see me scratch it."
kramer, Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
jerry," I'm telling you man, I'm losing it."
jerry," I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with 
              that dog."
kramer, I don't know where the tops are. 
kramer, Jerry what's the matter?
jerry,"  Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good."
bartender," Hey, you looking for George?"
bartender," He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to 
              check on him."
george,"  Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes 
              down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's 
              room on 43rd street in my underpants."
elaine, They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
newman, Hello Elaine. Where are they?
elaine, In the back.
newman," All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass."
newman," If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, 
              we have a situation here and time is of the essence."

regulars,
george, What is Holland?
george," No, that's the Netherlands."
jerry, Holland *is* the Netherlands.
george, Then who are the Dutch?
george," I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn 
              star."
jerry," I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation."
george, Well why didn't we?
jerry," Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation 
              from"

              job."
george," Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?"
jerry," No more crutches, that must be a relief."
george," Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions."
jerry, Not with a cane?
george," Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's 
              a sad story. "
jerry," Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight.

bania," Killed.  I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good looking 
              ones,"
george, Killed.
jerry," Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like 
              that fish"
george, And you're the shark?
jerry," Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs."
george, I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
jerry," Well, I'm glad I brought it up."
kramer, Got any shredded coconut?
kramer," Yeah, yeah, right. "
george, Oh my god.
jerry, What?
george, I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
jerry, So what's this job?
george," Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports."
jerry, Knicks? Rangers?
george, Playground equipment.
jerry, Welcome back to the show.
kramer," Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?"
jerry, No.
kramer, D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.
jerry, What kind do you use?
kramer, Whatever you get.
kramer, Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
jerry, Remember David Puddy?
kramer," She's dating him again, huh?"
jerry," Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the 
              top of the"
kramer," Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home 
              in a body"
puddy," Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a 
              twenty kroner. "
elaine, We have to break up.
puddy, What?
elaine," I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting 
              the"
puddy," Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has 
              that's not"
elaine," Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are 
              through!"
puddy, Fine!
elaine, Fine!
captain," Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, 
              will be"
kramer," Hey, what are you doing?"
jerry," Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched 
              the floor of a"
kramer," Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the 
              Internet he"
jerry," He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. 
              He's a time"
kramer," Well, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a 
              stick of"
jerry," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute."
kramer, What?
jerry, Do I have to ask?
kramer," I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything 
              else, Mr. Nosy?"
jerry, Why are you buttering your face?
kramer, I'm shaving with it.
jerry, Oh Moses smell the roses.
kramer," Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. 
              Now feel"
jerry, No.
kramer, Feel it.
jerry, I don't want to.
kramer, Feel it. Feel it.
george, I got the job?
george, Handicap?  I'm not handicapped.
george," Yeah, I didn't mean that."
george, When do I start?
george," Yeah, what the hell."
jerry, You got the job?
george," Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They 
              treat me so"
jerry," Hold on, they think you're handicapped?"
george," Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the 
              bathroom"
jerry, How can you do this?
george," Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm 
              just now"
jerry, He drove a car with no arms?
george," Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest 
              is true. He"
jerry," Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I 
              know you?"
george," I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. 
              I feel like a"
kramer, They hooked me up.
george, What's with all the butter?
kramer," I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?"
jerry, You can eat it?
kramer," No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my 
              body."
jerry," Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna."
george, Who?
jerry, The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
bania," Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?"
jenna, Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.
bania, Oh. This is awkward.
jenna," Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure."
jerry, I don't believe this.
george," You miss her, don't you?"
jerry," No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything 
              off me,"
george, You miss her.
elaine, You missed quite a performance.
jerry, Someone's cooking.
newman," Hello, Jerry."
jerry," Hello, Newman."
newman," You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf 
              between us and"
newman," Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's 
              got something"
jerry," No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter 
              - pause - Oh"
newman, Butter?
woman," David, you are so funny."
puddy," Yeah, I know."
puddy," It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life."
elaine, By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
puddy," Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with 
              you and, uh,"
elaine, This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
puddy," Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were 
              up to me, we'd"
elaine, Well maybe I feel the same way.
puddy, Ok.
elaine," Ok, so now what?"
puddy, Let's make out.
jerry, Kramer!
kramer," Oh, man. I think I cooked myself."
jerry, Look at your skin.
kramer," Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
kramer, I'm fried.
jerry," Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for 
              that?"
kramer," Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
jerry, Is that what the doctor said?
kramer," No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine."
jerry," Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with 
              you?"
george," No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because 
              I sprained my"
jerry, What happened?
george," Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --"
jerry," Oh no, not you too?"
george, I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
jerry, You know what's good for that? Relish.
jerry," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! 
              No!!! "
george," So what, he's got a couple of good jokes."
jerry," Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? 
              Shopping"
george," That's true, that always happens to me."
jerry, You think that's funny?
george," I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about 
              too much."
jerry, You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
george, maybe I am.
jerry," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
george," Puke! That's a funny word. Puke.  puke! Don't 
              have to"
elaine, I can't believe we broke up like that.
elaine, Do you want something to read?
puddy, Nah.
elaine," Well, are you going to take a nap or --"
puddy, Nah.
elaine," You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a 
              seat?"
puddy, Yeah.
elaine," That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing 
              has"
puddy," Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back."
elaine," Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable 
              lasagna"
elaine," Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and 
              we just ram"
passenger, Ow! Ow!!
newman," How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here."
kramer, Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
newman," The smell. It's still with you, huh?"
kramer," Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up 
              so it melts."
kramer," Ahh, now I'm simmering."
newman, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
george," Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up."
george," That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, 
              when we"
george," See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?"
george," Well, you're not gonna believe what happened."
jerry, You mugged Stephen Hawking?
george," Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal 
              Rascal,"
jerry," Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight 
              to hell at"
jerry, Hello?
elaine, Jerry.
jerry," Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?"
elaine, Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
jerry, Who's that?
elaine, It's Vegetable Lasagna.
jerry, Who?
elaine, Vegetable Lasagna!
elaine, Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
jerry, Get me some duty free Kahlua.
george, How's the trip?
jerry, Sounded good.
jerry," Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by 
              the big showcase"
george," Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?"
jerry," That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little 
              off."
george, What are you talking about? You're not!
jerry," That's right, I'm taking a dive."
george, You're throwing the set?
jerry," I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without 
              all the"
george," Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. 
              My"

newman, Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
kramer," What are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw 
              your set?"
jerry," That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without 
              the cushy"
jerry, If you'll excuse me.
jerry," What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, 
              why do you want"
jerry, And what's with people getting sick?
newman, Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
jerry," I mean, what's the deal with cancer?"
kramer," Oh, tough crowd."
man," Hey, hey! You dented my ride."
george," Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor."
man, How about I do you a favor upside your head?
george, Oh yeah?
man, Oh yeah.
man, Hey!
woman, Get the bikes.
bania, Ouch.
kramer, You didn't do so bad.
jerry, What are you talking about? I bombed!
kramer," No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, 
              it was not"
jerry, Like who?
kramer, Like that guy who yelled out.
jerry, He had cancer!
kramer, And laughter is the best medicine.
jerry," Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you."
kramer," Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big 
              turkey out"
kramer, A big fat turkey.
newman, I'm sorry I missed that.
kramer, He worked so hard and then he just--
kramer," What is this, oregano?"
kramer," Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and 
              it's sticking"
newman, Here. Hold this.
kramer," What is this, parsley?"
jerry," Ah, the sweet stench of failure."
kramer," Get off of me, get off of me!"

man, Eat hickory!!
bania," Hey Jerry, didja see it?"
jerry, Ouch.
stu," Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. 
              Listen,"
jerry, What?
jay," That thing you did having the two guys running through? I 
              love stuff you"
stu, Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
jay," By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky."
bania," How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now 
              I'll have"
jerry," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
bania, Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?

thomassoulo," George, 
              youre not really handicapped, are you? "
george," Ive 
              had my difficulties. "
thomassoulo," I 
              saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized 
              cart with one hand. "
george," Mr. Thomassoulo 
              during times of great stress, people are capable of super human 
              strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?"
thomassoulo," No 
              "
george," How about 
              the old Spider Man live action show?"
thomassoulo," George, 
              Ive realized weve signed a one-year contract with you, 
              but at this point I think its best that we both go our separate 
              ways. "
george," I dont 
              understand."
thomassoulo," We 
              dont like you. We want you to leave. "
george, Clearer
,
jerry," So youre 
              staying at Play Now?"
george," Why not? 
              Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped 
              toilets in the city."
jerry," But they 
              not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?"
george," Theyre 
              the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. 
              As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me."
elaine, Hey
george," Hello-o-o-o 
              Elaine!"
elaine," Whats 
              that?"
jerry," Oh, its 
              just this stupid thing. "
elaine," Well, 
              Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?"
jerry,  No-o-o-o.
george,  Not at all.
elaine, Tell me!
jerry," All right. 
              You know this girl Clare I am seeing? "
elaine, Yeah.
jerry," Well, he 
              and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays 
              awake all night and talks to me."
elaine," How is 
              it talking?"
jerry," Well, her 
              belly button is like a mouth.  Im bored. 
              Talk to me."
elaine," Oh I gotta 
              start taking these ""stupid"" warnings more seriously."
jerry," Hey, look 
              whose here - Puddy. "
elaine," My Puddy? 
              But we broke up."
jerry," And yet 
              he continues to live."
puddy," Hey Benes, 
              How are you?"
elaine," Im 
              doing great. "
puddy," Great. 
               See ya."
jerry," Well, thats 
              it. You two are back together."
elaine, What?
jerry," The bump 
              into. The bump into always leads to the backslide."
elaine," David 
              and I <i>will</i> not be getting back together. "
jerry," Elaine, 
              breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant 
              do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, 
              and then it goes over."
george," Thats 
              beautiful."
elaine," What about 
              you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that."
jerry," Thats 
              different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, 
              youll backslide"
elaine," You want 
              to bet?"
jerry, Stakes?

clare," So Ill 
              call you tonight?"
jerry, Yeah.
clare," Whats 
              wrong with the belt?"
jerry," I went 
              to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled 
              a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of 
              the urinal. So thats it!"
clare," So, youre 
              insane?"
jerry," Oh yes, 
              quite."
kramer, Hello!
jerry," Of course 
              its a sliding scale."
clare," Catch you 
              later."
jerry,  La la la.
kramer,  La la la.
kramer," Look at 
              this, they are redoing the Cloud Club."
jerry," Oh, that 
              restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a 
              good idea."
kramer," Of course 
              its a good idea, its <i>my</i> idea. I conceived this 
              whole project two years ago."
jerry," Which part? 
              The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending 
              the two hundred million you dont have part?"
kramer," You see 
              I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing 
              happens. You know why?"
jerry," No resources, 
              no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains."
kramer,"  
              No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, 
              grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any 
              idea how much time I waste in this apartment?"
jerry," I can ball 
              park it."
elaine,  Hello-o-o-o!
kramer," Here we 
              go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!"
jerry," Hey, I 
              called you last night, where were you?"
elaine,  I went out with a  a friend.
jerry, George?
elaine,"  No, nono."

              was here, thats everyone ."
elaine, .
jerry," Are those 
              the same shoes as yesterday?"
elaine," Oh, you 
              know I wear these shoes all the time. "
jerry," Your hair, 
              its somewhat de-poofed. "
elaine," Its 
              the new look. You know Heroin Cheek? "
jerry," Wait a 
              second, whats going on here?"
elaine," Nothing, 
              nothing. "
jerry, .
elaine, .
jerry," Youre 
              wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!!  You saw Puddy!"
kramer," Hoochie 
              moochie. "
jerry," Hand it 
              over. Pay up."
elaine," No! Its 
              an isolated, sexual incident. We are <i>not</i> back together!"
jerry," Then what 
              do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and 
              have sex. This isnt cinemax."
elaine," It was 
              no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed 
              a little dinner. "
jerry," Ah, dinner! 
              Thats it, youre all the way back!"
elaine, Ugh!
jerry," Sex, thats 
              meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. 
              Thats like an hour."
kramer,"  Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun 
              . That was my idea too!"

george, Good Morning!
co-worker," Go 
              to hell!"
george," Hi Allison,

kramer," So 
              thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, 
              you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead 
              and look through some of the drawers. "
jerry," And you 
              are?"
darren," Oh, hey, 
              Im Darren. Im new here."
kramer," Yeah, 
              thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont 
              you go across the hall and get started on that mail."
darren, Right!
kramer," Hes 
              a go getter!"
jerry," Whos 
              he? "
kramer," My intern 
              from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries."
jerry, Alright.
kramer," Well, 
              apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting 
              some real world corporate experience. "
jerry," But you 
              only provide fantasy world corporate experience."
kramer," Well, 
              this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important 
              things, like my bladder system."
jerry," Alright, 
              its time to go. "
kramer," Jerry, 
              its not for people, its for oil tankers."
jerry,"  
              I know!"
kramer," You see 
              the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, 
              the oil wont spill out."
jerry," Actually, 
              that is not a bad idea."
kramer,"  
              yeah."
jerry," Now, its 
              time to go."
jerry, Hello
george,  Hello-o-o-o. .
jerry,"  Hello-o-o-o.  So, whats going on?"
george,"   Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve 
              downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers 
           last days here."
jerry," So, are 
              you going to leave?"
george," Oh no! 
              Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like 
              a weed, Jerry."
jerry," I thought 
              youre like Hitler in the bunker?"
george," Im 
              a weed in Hitlers bunker."
jerry," Im 
              getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.  Im getting another call, see ya Hello!"
darren," Hi, this 
              is Darren from Kramers office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule 
              a lunch with you at Monks coffee shop."
jerry,  Really? When?
darren," In 10 
              minutes. Do you need directions?"
jerry," No, I dont."
darren," Well, 
              Ill call back in 5 minutes to confirm. "
kramer," Yeah, 
              5."
elaine, Hey!
jerry," Hey! So, 
              wheres my money?"
elaine," No money, 
              I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?"
jerry," Oh yeah, 
              hold on."
jerry," Hello Darren, 
              this is Jerry from Jerrys office. . 
              Were going to be three for lunch.  What do you mean hes already left?"
jerry," Hey, Elaine 
              is going to come with us, alright?"
kramer," What? 
              When did this happen?"
jerry," Well, just"
kramer,"  
              DARREN!"
,
elaine," I am <i>not</i> 
              calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them 
              over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, 
              I better not. Ill call.  Oh, look at that! 
              There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. 
              Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really 
              really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. ."
,
george," Well, 
              Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. 
              They tried to sweat me out."
jerry," Do you 
              have to write <i>all</i> this stuff down."
darren," Well, 
              Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnt want 
              to miss anything."
jerry," So, how 
              hot did it get?"
george," I dont 
              know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 
              hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. "
jerry," I guess 
              you can take anything, but actual work."
george," Bring 
              it on!"
george,  Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
jerry,  Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
george,  La la la.
kramer," Sorry 
              I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? "
darren," Well, 
              after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether 
              or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and 
              his iron suit"
kramer, Uh huh
george,"  
              And I still say hes naked under there!"
jerry," Oh that 
              makes a lot of sense."
george," Oh, shut 
              up!"
darren," Then 
              Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped 
              ice out of Mr. Seinfelds drink with his bare hands using it 
              to wash up  then 
              Mr. Costanza remarked to me, ""This never happened."" ."
,
jerry, 
clare," Whats 
              so funny?"
jerry," Oh, nothing. 
              "
clare," What are 
              you laughing about? Tell me."
jerry," Oh all 
              right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing 
              this silly, dumb voice."
clare," So is it 
              fun humiliating me?"
jerry," No, its 
              not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, 
              booming, jovial voice.  Hello-o-o-o."
clare," So you 
              think Im fat?"
jerry, No its
darren," Mr. Kramer 
              says, ""hey buddy!"""
jerry," Hey, were 
              kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back 
              later?"
darren," Oh yeah 
              sure, sure. Should we set something up now?"
jerry,"  
              GET OUT!"
clare," Im 
              leaving too."
jerry," No body 
              said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade 
              guy."
clare," <i>He</i> 
              is fat!"
jerry," No, hes 
              just a little bloated."
clare, Good-bye!
jerry," Its 
              mostly water weight."
kramer," Boysenberry, 
              the kid is still learning."
darren," Mr. KramerDean, 
              my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting."
kramer," Yeah, 
              well nothing before noon."
jerry, Line two?
kramer," Yeah, 
              your phone is line one."
jerry, Oh
,
puddy," So the 
              gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny."
elaine," See, this 
              is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. 
              We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are 
              back together."
puddy," I mean 
              I love just seeing you and having sex."
elaine, Yeah.
puddy," Not having 
              to do all thatyou knowwork."
elaine," Well, 
              either way"
puddy," All that 
              calling you, and buying you stuff"
elaine, David
puddy," Caring 
              about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its 
              brutal."
elaine," Alright 
              thats it! Were back together!"
puddy," Oh, no."
elaine," Oh, yeah."
puddy," Look Elaine, 
              be reasonable."
elaine," Get those 
              clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were 
              going to cuddle."
puddy, What?
elaine," You heard 
              me. Strip!"
,
george, ..AlrightOK.
george,"  Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are 
              you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message 
              for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him  IM IN 
              MY OFFICE! Thanks."
,
kramer," Dean Jones, 
              you wanting to talk to me?"
kramer, Yeah.
kramer," I know 
              it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica. 
              "
kramer," And with 
              Darrens help, well get that chicken."
kramer," Well, 
              I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary."
,
jerry," So youre 
              sure youre not still angry about last night?"
clare," No, Im 
              fine. Just as long as you dont ever do that voice again."
jerry, Never?
clare, Never.
jerry," What about 
              if youre not around?"
clare, No!
jerry," So I have 
              to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?"
clare," Thats 
              right."
jerry," I can do 
              that."
clare," So whats 
              your decision?"
jerry," I dont 
              know."
clare, JerryHI.
jerry,  Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. 
,
george," You broke 
              up with her? Why?"
jerry," So we could 
              do the voice.  La-la-la. Whats the matter?"
george," I think 
              Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? 
              La-la-la?"
jerry," No, it 
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              can do anything. It can be Spanish.  Hola. Hello-o-o-o."
george," I think 
              I like the girl better than the voice."
jerry, Really?
jerry,  Hello-o-o-o.
elaine, Still?
george," I told 
              you."
elaine," Alright, 
              here you go, choke on it ."
jerry," See, never 
              bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together."
elaine," Yeah, 
              well not for long. Im breaking up with him."
jerry," No, I dont 
              think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. 
              Its kismet."
elaine," Double 
              or nothing."
jerry, Done.
george,  Witness?
jerry," Youre 
              in there again. "
george," I think 
              Play Now is putting something in my food."
elaine," Alright, 
              Im out of here."
jerry," What is 
              this? ."
kramer," I dont 
              know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent 
              been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. 
              Im clueless.  Is that clock right?"
jerry," Yeah. Nine 
              oclock."
kramer," I was 
              supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago."
jerry,  Good-bye Kramer.
kramer," Jerry, 
              buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played."
jerry, Really?
kramer, So played.
george," I told 
              you."
,
kramer," Darren? 
              What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship."
darren," I dont 
              care about the internship. I care about Kramerica."
kramer," Kramerica 
              is no more."
darren," What about 
              the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime 
              oil spills."
kramer," Probably. 
              Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica."
kramer," Well, 
              youre still here?"
darren," I havent 
              had time to leave."
kramer," Well, 
              I havent changed my mind."
kramer," Well, 
              you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica 
              industries lives! Lets get back to work!"
kramer," Lets 
              see what Jerry has to eat."
,
thomassoulo," You 
              win George. Weve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now 
              will give you six months pay. Thats half of your entire contract. 
              Pleasejust go."
george," You see 
              if I stay the whole year, I get it all."
thomassoulo," Want 
              to play hand ball huh? Fine.  Attention Play 
              Now employees, George Costanzas handicapped bathroom is now 
              open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families."
george, Well played.
thomassoulo," Ill 
              see you in hell Costanza."
,
jerry,"  Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our 
              relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. 
              Hold on one second.  So 
              we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore?  Alright, were back together again, great. Bye 
              bye."
(scene," Hallway 
               Kramer &amp; Darren are pushing an oil tank."
kramer, Hey.
jerry," Trouble 
              down at the plant?"
kramer," Its 
              a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder 
              system."
george," You have 
              to drink that whole thing?"
kramer," No. No. 
              No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort 
              of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or 
              not it can restrain the impact."
jerry," I understand 
              ."
george," Would 
              a giant rubber ball work?"
kramer, Conceivably.
george," Well, 
              Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont 
              we test your bladder system at my office?"
jerry," Youre 
              not"
george," Oh, yes 
              I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing 
              dirtier than a giant ball of oil."
,
puddy," Hey, you 
              want to split a root beer ?"
elaine," I dont 
              think so David, were through."
puddy," OhThats 
              a nice sweater ."
,
elaine," Whew that 
              was a dozy."
,
jerry, Go again?
elaine, Book it.
george,  Witness.
,
elaine," David 
              I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be ."
,
jerry," Ha ha ha. 
              Ha ha ha ha. "
,
elaine," Im 
              going to get some popcorn. "
,
elaine," So, how 
              did it end?"
jerry," They got 
              away."
elaine, uh.
,
elaine," Listen 
              David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?"
,
jerry, Hey.
kramer," Did you 
              bring the video camera?"
jerry," Yeah, I 
              put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, 
              and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya."
george," Oh, you 
              might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong 
              man to hire because he was fake handicapped."
jerry," I cant. 
              I got to meet Clare."
kramer," You gave 
              up the voice?"
jerry," Yeah, I 
              thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again."
jerry, Darren?
darren," Sorry 
              Mr. Seinfeld."
jerry," Uh, bathroom."
george," Hey, use 
              mine. Ill let you in."
jerry," I thought 
              it was open to the public."
george," I uh, 
              took care of that."
jerry," Wow! Zanadu 
              . No wonder youre putting in so many hours.  
              May I?"
george," I insist. 
              Ill fix us a drink.  
              I got it."
kramer," Whew. 
              You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago 
              that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds 
              energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now 
              lets push this giant ball of oil out the window."
george," So, check 
              out my view."
jerry," Wow! Hey, 
              theres Clare. I better go down."
george," Hey, theres 
              Kramer &amp; Darren."
jerry," Theres 
              the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. 
              Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!"
clare," I dont 
              believe this. I am <i>not</i> looking up if youre going to 
              do that voice."
kramer," Bombs 
              away ."
jerry," This is 
              going to be a shame."
george, Hello.
kramer," Well, 
              that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard 
              in the same bottle? "
darren," Oh that 
              sounds interesting sir."
kramer, Yeah.
,
jerry," Clare won 
              her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. 
              I guess youre not going in anymore. "
george, Yeah.
jerry," So theyre 
              not paying you your"
george, No.
jerry," So youre 
              pretty much"
george, Yeah.
jerry," What ever 
              happened to Darren?"
kramer," Darren 
              is going away for a long long time. "
jerry," So Clare 
              sure looked real funny covered in oil like that  Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil"
george,  Im slippery as an eel
kramer,  La la la.
jerry," Im 
              just so glad its back."
,
elaine," See, this 
              is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling 
              ourselves. We belong together."
puddy," Elaine 
              I want to break up."
elaine, Ah nuts!
cast,
frank, I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward. 
estelle, That's as far as it goes. 
frank," There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body 
              weight. "
estelle, I pulled it. It doesn't go. 
frank," If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't 
              blame"
george," All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit"
frank," Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like 
              an animal!"
george, What is that? 
frank," Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure 
              gets"
george, Are you supposed to yell it? 
frank, The man on the tape wasn't specific. 
george, What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? 
estelle, I told you to fix that thing.

jerry, Miffed. 
patty, *Mad*. 
jerry, Irked? 
patty, I'd like to see you get *really* mad. 
george, Why does she want you to be mad? 
jerry, She says I suppress my emotions. 
george, So what do you care what she thinks. 
jerry, Good body. 
george, She probably gets that impression because you're cool.
jerry," But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell. "
george, Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic

estelle, I hate that old door. Throw it out!

jerry, 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass! 
patty," OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it. "
jerry, You're damn right you're not buying it! 
patty, You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open. 
jerry, I'm open. There's just nothing in there. 
patty, Sarcastically) Uh huh.

patty, I think you are.

adam, Are you free Friday night?

              I am"
adam, But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.

george, You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell
elaine," Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your"
adam,"  Well, that does me a lot of"

patty, How about La Caridad again? 
jerry, Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? 
patty," Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon. "
jerry," Well, I don't think more flan is the answer! "
patty, Maybe I should just leave. 
jerry, 'Maybe'!? 
patty, Good-bye! 
jerry," Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,"
kramer," Hey, buddy! "
elaine,  Hey. Happy New Year!

              talk about"
elaine," Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard"
jerry," That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there 
              also,"
elaine, Whoa. What is the matter? 
jerry, It's Patty. 
elaine," Jerry, you break up with a girl every week. "
jerry,  What--what is this salty discharge? 
elaine, Oh my God. You're crying. 
jerry, This is horrible! I care! 
jerry," Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without 
              her. "
kramer," She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? "
jerry, I don't know what's happening to me. 
kramer," Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come"
jerry, That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. 
kramer," Yeah, well, she... had one, too. "
george," Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's"

jerry," I love you, George. Come here. "
george," I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?"

kramer," Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn 
              this"
george, What signal? What-what signal? 
kramer," I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!' "
george," If I do it, will you buy a computer? "
kramer," On the signal, George. On the signal. "
george, Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. 
jerry," I love you, Costanza. "

elaine, So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. 
george," Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa. "
elaine, What? 
george, It means a non-Jewish woman. 
elaine," I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have 
              to"
george, You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of

george," I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get 
              you"
elaine, I am not buying a computer from you. 
george, There's porn. 
elaine,  Even so. 
george, Damn it! 
elaine," Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that"
lippman, That's simply not true. 
elaine," If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me. 
            "
lippman, You are wrong. I'll prove it. 
elaine," Oh, no. Don't! "
lippman, I renounce Judaism! 
elaine, Oy vey!

kramer, Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They
jerry, Are you all right? 
kramer," Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity 
              now."
jerry," So, you're using Frank's relaxation method? "
kramer, Serenity! 
elaine, Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is
jerry," Sit down, Elaine. "
elaine," Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing. "
jerry, I've been thinking about what it means to be complete. 
elaine, Do you have an apple or anything? 
jerry," Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble. 
            "
elaine, Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.

lloyd," You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing"
george, What do you know? You were in the nut house. 
lloyd, What do you think put me there? 
george, I heard they found a family in your freezer 
lloyd, Serenity now. Insanity later.

kramer," Serenity now, serenity now... "
jerry, Kramer! 
kramer," Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,"

kramer,  Serenity nooooowwwww! 
george, Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls
kramer,"  George, you listen to me. I owe ya one. "
jerry, He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it? 
george," Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't

jerry," George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've 
              ever done."
george, All right... here goes... 
elaine," Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this"

rabbi," You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in

        three times a week. "

        to go down, I don't back off until it's finished. "

vivian," Elaine, I'm so glad you came out. "

      "

        I can do to lend support to the mood. "
george," Um, cream soda? "
tara, Vanilla. 
elaine," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible? "
jerry," Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first 
        thing they ask is who's responsible for this? "
elaine," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around. 
      "
jerry," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? "
george," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell 
        drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. 
        We need some pudding here! Pudding! "
elaine, You just left? What did you tell her? 
george," I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another 
        hour. "
jerry, What? 
george," I don't know, I was starving Jerry! "
george," Oh, pudding! You want some? "
jerry," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? "
george," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding 
        needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it 
        on the stove. "
jerry," Elaine, what do you think? "
elaine," I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. 
      "
kramer," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your 
        hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood 
        elsewhere, yeah. "

        with...my money! "

tara, I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. 
george," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, 
        your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... "

        9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? "

      "

        meats? "
george," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, 
        it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's 
        only natural to combine them. "
jerry," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man 
        and a sandwich. "
george," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral. 
      "
jerry," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about 
        satisfying one of somebody else's. "
george," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin 
        from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto 
        knife. "
jerry," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification 
        program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. "
george," Well, I guess these would be out of the question.  "
jerry, What the hell is that? 
george, Pudding skin singles. 
kramer," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. "
jerry," Oh, why? "
kramer, I closed down my account at the blood bank. 
jerry," What, it...it's here in the building? "
kramer," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? "
jerry," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should 
        find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out. 
      "
kramer," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. "
elaine," Hey, working out? "
jerry, You know it and I ditched all my junk food. 
kramer, What the heck is going on here? 
jerry," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. "
kramer," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. "
elaine," Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her 
        mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other 
        someone. "
jerry, Is this about me? 
elaine, No. 
jerry," Oh, then I lost interest. "

        message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on... 
      "
kramer," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. 
         Well, somebody's baby-sitting. "
elaine, You? I'm more responsible than you are! 
kramer," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to 
        fill my freezer with my own blood. "
george," Oh, Tara! "
kramer," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. "
elaine, Kramer... 
kramer, Don't take my money! 
elaine," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, 
        I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. "
kramer," No, I'm the baby-sitter. "
elaine," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. "
vivian, Elaine? What are you doing here? 
elaine," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help 
        out... what's that, some raccoon or something... "
vivian," Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? 
        She's gonna watch you tonight. "
elaine, Hi Jimmy.  Ouch!  
jerry," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting 
        at Vivian's. "
kramer, There was an incident. 
jerry," Oh no, where's the blood?  It's in here isn't 
        it? "
kramer, Would you stop it. 
jerry, What is this? 
kramer, It's Jell-O. 
jerry, What about this? This is blood isn't it?! 
kramer," This is tomato juice, look... "
jerry," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! "
kramer," Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He 
        let me put it in his meat freezer. "
jerry," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? "
kramer," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding 
        skin singles. They're delicious. "
jerry," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here 
        anymore... "
kramer, Heads up! 
jerry, Aaah... 
jimmy," You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead! "
elaine, I wish I was dead. 
jimmy, Can I have your juice? 
elaine, As long as you don't put... 
elaine, Thanks for the re-fill. 
vivian," Hey, Elaine! How did it go? "
elaine," Oh, he's...he's a joy... "
vivian, Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful. 
elaine," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. "
vivian," Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health 
        problems lately. "
elaine," It's not serious, is it? "
vivian," Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice 
        to know there's somebody like you around. "
elaine," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.  "
jerry, Aah! 
kramer," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. "
jerry, I can see that! What happened? 
kramer," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody 
        yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. "
jerry, I'll remember that. 
kramer," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood. 
      "
jerry, What? 
kramer," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. "
george, Three pints of Kramer's blood? 
jerry," I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood. 
      "
george," Well, so much for purification week. "
jerry," So, how's the fornicating gourmet? "
george," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg 
        and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that 
        would really be the ultimate. "
jerry," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. "
elaine, Hey. 
jerry," Hey, how was baby-sitting? "
elaine," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical 
        problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. "
jerry," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. "
elaine," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors 
        mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world. 
      "
george," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on 
        a baby-sitting gig. "
jerry, Really? 
kramer," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all 
        bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave 
        it for me, huh? "
jerry, I'm not touching that thing. 
kramer," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood 
        brother. "
jerry," Oh, no... "
kramer," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... "
jerry," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. "
kramer," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because 
        I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table! 
      "
jerry," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. "
kramer," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, 
        we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? "
jerry, Hello? 
helen," Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital. "
jerry, Kramer called you? 
helen, He calls every week. Are you all right? 
jerry," Yes, I'm fine. "
helen, He says he's fine. 
morty, Tell him to eat a plum. 
helen," Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought 
        you some session with a personal trainer. "
jerry," I don't need a personal trainer.  all right I've 
        got to go, we'll talk about this later. "
morty, Plum... 
jerry, Why are you calling my parents? 
kramer," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, 
        is it all right if I watch a tape in here? "
jerry, Why here? 
kramer," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. "
jerry, Ok... 
kramer," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed 
        is really nice? "
jerry, Fine... 
kramer, Ok! 
jerry, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! 
kramer, Blood! 
jerry, All right. 
izzy," Hello, dough boy. "
jerry, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? 
izzy," I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need 
        one. It's go-time. "
vivian, Elaine? Elaine? 
elaine," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. "
vivian, Where's Jimmy? 
elaine," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then 
        eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running 
        around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you 
        I'm no good watching that kid. "
vivian," Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best. "
elaine," No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job 
        or keep a man! "
vivian," Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow? "
elaine," All right, but I'm running out of purses here.  "
jerry," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? "
izzy," Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball. "
jerry," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? "
izzy," Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready? "
jerry, For what? 
izzy, All aboard in the pain train! 
jerry, How many session did my parents paid for? 
izzy," Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil. "
george," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! "
tara," Oh, George! "
george, And now for the trifecta.  
tara, George? George? What are you doing?!  
george, Pleasuring you? 
jerry, What is this? 
kramer, We're making sausages. 
jerry, I thought you were gonna watch a video. 
kramer," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages. 
      "
jerry," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. "
kramer," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and 
        haul these beauties out of here. "
jerry," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter 
        house. "
izzy, Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae.  What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet? 
jerry, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... 
izzy," Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch. "
jerry," So, the free love buffet is over? "
george," I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami. 
      "
jerry," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session 
        with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. "
jerry, What's going on? 
george, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. 
jerry," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food 
        and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. "
george, I think you're right. You gonna eat that? 
jerry," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. "
elaine," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major 
        inconvenience. "
george, These fries are really really good... 
jerry," All right, that's enough of that.  "
elaine," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to 
        Jimmy's birthday party. "
george," Uuh, sleepy. "
elaine," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid. 
      "
jerry," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you. 
      "
elaine," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel. "
kramer, Why did you get rid of that sausage? 
jerry," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum. "
kramer," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. 
        Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car? 
      "
jerry, What's wrong with yours? 
kramer," I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad. 
      "
jerry," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even! 
      "
kramer," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to 
        your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your 
        bed. "
kramer," Oh, man... ""If 
        the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, 
        I can't do that. "
kramer," Oh, mama... "
kramer," Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry. 
         "
elaine, Vivian... 
vivian, Elaine! 
elaine, Hi! This is my friend George. 
vivian, Hi... 
elaine, I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy. 
vivian, Ok. 
vivian," Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic? "
george," Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her. 
      "
vivian," Really, why? "
george," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents 
        in Redding Pennsylvania. "
vivian, Her grandparent passed away five years ago. 
george," Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to 
        Scotland. "
vivian," She's American citizen, I have seen her passport. "
george," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the 
        Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. "
vivian, I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere. 
george, That's because it's underwater. 
vivian, This is insane. 
george, Is it? 
vivian, Yes it it. 
george," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference. "
vivian, You...very knowledgeable. 
george," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? "
vivian," Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all 
        the salted cured meats. Hungry? "
george, Very. 
vivian," Oh, wait... Oohh... "
george, Vivian!! 
jerry, Is this really necessary? 
izzy," If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a 
        piece of meat. "
jerry, What if I can't keep up? 
izzy," You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son. "
izzy," Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it! 
      "
jerry, What's going on? 
jerry," Oh my God, the blood! "
izzy," Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is 
        for real, you've got to want it... "
elaine, So how long did they drag you? 
jerry," Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just 
        doggin' it. "
elaine, Hi George. Hi Jimmy. 
george," Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something. 
      "
george, Ouch! 
jerry, What's the kid doing here? 
george," I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't 
        make it. "
jerry," Oh, that's a drag... "
kramer, That kid... 
jerry, You put blood in the car?! 
kramer," Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that 
        thing. "
jerry," Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you 
        again. "
kramer, You didn't get the blood from me. 
jerry, Then who? 
newman, Hello Jerry. 
jerry, Aaaaahhh...!!! 
jerry, Why were you making gravel?
kramer, Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.            
jerry, Of course. It's garbage.
kramer," No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, 
              this is the set from the old Merv Griffin "
jerry," Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian."
kramer," Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on 
              you and the next thing - "
jerry," Come on, Kramer, get out of there."
kramer," No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this 
              in."
jerry, &lt;moans&gt;
george," You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days 
              ago. Can't smell anything, can "
miranda, Banana?
george, Right.
miranda, George watch out for those pigeons.
george, Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
miranda, Oh my God. Oh.
george, So uh where are we eating?
jerry, And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
celia, You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
jerry, Wow! 
celia, Oh yeah the toys.
jerry, Where did you get all these?
celia," My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from 
              a long and painful bout ..."
jerry," Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman 
              suit. "
celia," Jerry, what are you doing?"
jerry, I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
celia, No Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with.
jerry, I just want to touch them a little.
celia, I said no. Now come here. 
lou, Hi I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here. 
elaine, Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy?
walter," Oh he's Lou Filerman. He's new here. Hey your coffee stain 
              looks like Fidel Castro."
elaine, You've been an enormous help.
jerry, You ran over some pigeons? How many?
george," What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's 
              not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?"
jerry," Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our 
              cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation. "
george," Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept 
              the blame for this."
jerry, So Maranda's cooled on y'a?
george, I'm getting nothing.
jerry," Yeah, me neither."
george, Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
jerry," Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection 
              and she won't let me near it!"
george, I don't understand women.
jerry, Here comes one.
elaine, Hey. What's going on?
george, Hey &lt;sees coffee marks&gt; Art Garfunkle?
elaine," No, Castro."
george, Right.
elaine," All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he 
              just comes out of nowhere and he's right "
jerry, So he just sidles up?
elaine, That's right! He's a real sidler.
jerry, Maybe you didn't see him.
elaine," You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was 
              sitting there making a cup of soup"
jerry, Hakuna Matata?
elaine, I thought I was alone.
jerry, That doesn't make it right.
jerry," See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing 
              as the cup of soup ..."
elaine, Would you just let it go?
kramer," Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!"
jerry, Oh my God!
kramer, It's the Merv Griffin set
jerry, How did you get this in here?
kramer," Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it."
jerry, So where are you gonna sleep?
kramer, Yeah ... backstage. 
elaine, Phew! This chair smells like garbage.
kramer," Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not 
              as hygienic as they appeared on TV"
jerry, I'm gonna get that. 
kramer," All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime&lt; 
              Jerry exits&gt; Well, Elaine Benes! "
elaine, &lt;giggles&gt;
george, We had a deal!
elaine," Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted."
peterman," One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article 
              on the most fascinating people of the "
elaine, What? 
jerry," So three dates and she still won't let me play with her 
              toys."
kramer," That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you 
              were not very happy with your toys growing up."
jerry," Yeah, that was me."
kramer," Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that 
              uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had."
jerry, An Army Pete.
kramer, Right.
jerry," He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and 
              then split."
kramer, And we all know how painful that can be.
elaine, Jerry
kramer," Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come 
              on sit down. Yes."
elaine," Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping 
              my hide."
kramer, Excuse me yeah. We're talking ... this way.
elaine," Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle 
              me right out of a job."
kramer," Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?"
elaine," Kramer, what is wrong with you?"
kramer, What do you mean?
elaine," Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards &lt;to 
              Jerry&gt; I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste "
jerry," You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!"
elaine, Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
kramer, Only in New York. ... ha ha 
george, Jerry? 
kramer," Oh! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George 
              Costanza! What a surprise! "
george," Well, it happened again."
jerry, What happened?
kramer," tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened?"
george," Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they 
              didn't move."
kramer," All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry 
              dated for a while. Tell us ... what "
george," I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's 
              like the pigeons decided to ignore me!"
jerry, So they're like everyone else.
kramer," &lt;laughs too loudly&gt; All right, let's take a short 
              break. .... Okay! We're back!"
george, Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off.
miranda, Then why don't you just run IT over too?
george, Zing.
miranda," George, what are you doing?"
george," Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to 
              swerve to get out of the way! I saved "
miranda," What pigeon? You drove right onto that squirrel. &lt;leaves 
              the car&gt;"
george," Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!"
celia, Jerry! Those hands! They never stop!
jerry, I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!
celia, No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
jerry," All right. &lt;Jerry checking in the medicine cabinet for 
              bottles that say ""cause drowsiness""&gt;"
lou, Here's the new copy you wanted. 
peterman," Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. 
              In record time. I'm very impressed ... "
elaine, &lt;quietly standing behind Lou&gt; Thank you. ha ha 
peterman," Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent 
              dribble! This is a total redo and I'm "
elaine," Well, I guess we'll just &lt;Lou has left&gt; Hey, just 
              gimme that. "
jerry," &lt;playing with the toys while Celia is sleeping&gt; Mission 
              accomplished! Back to base, Joe."
miranda," Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?"
doctor," There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to 
              save him but it would be costly, "
george," Well, uh, are there any other options?"
doctor, We could put him to sleep.
george, What might that cost?
doctor," Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents."
george," Well? &lt;Miranda hits George&gt; I was just - I'm curious, 
              that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do "
doctor," He, um. he's not going to be the same, you know?"
george, yeah. yeah. I know.
george, So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
kramer, El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
newman, &lt;laughs&gt;El Paso! 
jerry, What's he here for?
kramer," To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's 
              going on with you? I understand "
jerry," Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has 
              this amazing toy collection and last night"
kramer," Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear 
              wedding bells?"
newman, Are you married right now?
jerry," Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her 
              the wrong kind of medicine and "
kramer," What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?"
jerry, She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!
george," Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!"
kramer," Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you 
              drugged a woman so you could take "
newman, I told you he was a risk.
jerry," Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!"
newman," Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these 
              chairs!"
kramer," Smile, everyone! We're back! "
lou," You wanted to see me, Elaine?"
elaine," Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um 
              ... you're spontaneous. You're "
lou, My dead tooth?
elaine, No. Your. &lt;breathes&gt;
lou, My breath?
elaine, Eechh. 
lou, What can I do?
elaine," Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these. 
              &lt;Tic Tacs&gt;"
lou," Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! &lt;he clicks ans 
              clicks now when he walks&gt;"
george, More wine and turkey? &lt;Pours Celia more wine&gt;
jerry," So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey 
              and a giant box of wine, I thought "
celia, What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
jerry, ... I think. Have some more wine. 
celia, What video did you get?
jerry," Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan."
george, Four hours.
jerry, More heavy gravy?
george," &lt;playing with toys&gt; Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.            "
newman," Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic 
              brand of waxed beans. you know. "
kramer," Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?"
newman, We've got no one!
kramer, We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.            
newman, What about a guest-host?
kramer, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
miranda," Doctor, how's the squirrel?"
george, Is he dead?
doctor," No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just 
              in time. Would you like to visit him?"
miranda, Yes he would.
doctor, You have 30 minutes. &lt;exits&gt;
goerge," So ... uh, squirrel."
doctor," One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what 
              time you'll be picking him up "
george, What's that?
doctor," Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better 
              off at home."
george, He has no home. He's a squirrel.
doctor," Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his 
              medicine six times a day and keep his "
jerry, Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
george," It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that 
              I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's "
kramer," Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come 
              by the set."
jerry," What about my ""questionable material""?"
kramer," Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... 
              we got Jim Fowler!"
jerry," Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" 
              is coming to your apartment?"
kramer," Well, I practically raised his kids."
george," That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. 
              Can I bring the squirrel by?"
kramer," What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur 
              hour? Look, George, I'm "
george," I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel 
              off my hands. It's practically "
elaine," Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I 
              got that problem solved."
jerry, Tic-Tacs worked?
elaine, He's a human maraca.
george," Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game."
elaine, You took him over to Celia's?
jerry, What? It's a victimless crime.
elaine," What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage 
              of?"
jerry," Okay, one victim."
elaine, I think it's unconscionable.
george," Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind 
              the EZ Bake oven."
elaine, EZ Bake oven?
elaine, Who wants cupcake?
george," Oh, me, me, me, me, me!"
jerry," You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old."
frank, &lt;on TV&gt; You step on it and it flushes.
elaine, Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
estelle, &lt;on TV&gt; Stop squirming.
george," Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me."
jerry, You're like eight years old.
estelle, &lt;on TV&gt; Georgie.
george, I was seven and a half.
peterman, That noise. that's the noise. 
elaine, What?
peterman," That inferno rattling sound that has plagued me these 
              past two days - and I could not find the "
elaine," No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!"
peterman," That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! 
              You haven't gone over to their side"
elaine, No Mister Peterman.
peterman," Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your 
              out on your can And if you are undead - "
elaine, Lou! In here! We have to talk.
lou," Oh, right. "
elaine," &lt;Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou&gt; No, stop it! Bad 
              voodoo. You gotta stop using these."
lou, Why?
elaine, Because they're turning your teeth green?
lou, I only buy the white ones.
elaine," Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different 
              reason. Just stop carrying these, okay? "
lou, I can't. It burns my cankers.
elaine, Binacca?
lou, Again.
elaine," Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!"
lou," I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey 
              Mouse gumball machine. They stopped "
elaine," Well, stinky, this is your lucky day."
kramer," Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal 
              expert Jim Fowler."
fowler, Where are the cameras?
kramer," But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you 
              drugged a woman in order to play with "
jerry, It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
kramer, And she doesn't know anything about this?
jerry," No, not a thing. "
newman, laughs
kramer," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on 
              out, Celia!"
celia, What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
jerry, What is this? What is she doing here?
kramer, It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.
celia," If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you 
              got another thing coming, buddy!"
newman, Go girl!
jerry," Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?"
george," Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle 
              of modern science!"
kramer, George I told you we're booked!
fowler, Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
kramer," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be 
              spicy. Yeah, George bring him over."
fowler," No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!"
kramer, Are we getting this?
jerry, So the whole set was destroyed?
kramer," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing."
george," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work 
              ... sorry about the set."
kramer," I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. 
              I'm not sure I was ready to have my own "
miranda," I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. &lt;exits&gt;"
jerry, So the squirrel's gonna make it?
george," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch."
jerry, Sleeping on the couch? So you're...
george," Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. 
              I'm getting in my car now and the last "
celia," I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to 
              someone."
elaine," Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster 
              he can be. More wine and turkey?"
celia, Who's he? &lt;Lou&gt;
elaine," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for 
              y'a."
elaine, Hey. 
jerry, Morning. 
elaine," Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this. "
jerry, But why? 
elaine, I need some space. 
george, Does that mean I have to go too? 
jerry, You don't think she's just talking to me? 
george," Hey, shut up. "
jerry, You shut up. 
elaine, I hate this. 
kramer, You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub. 
elaine," No, I don't want this anymore. "
jerry, We'll come to work with you. 
george, And on your dates. 
jerry, And shopping. 
kramer, And to the bathroom. 
elaine," I can't breath...I'm sorry... You're killing 
        me! "
elaine,  Turn your alarm off!!  
kruger," Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to 
        what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing? "
george," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, 
        you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the 
        grind'. "
kruger, It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days? 
george," That should be 14, let me just... "
kruger," George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but 
        what the hell, we need someone, huh. "
george," You won't regret this, sir. "
kruger, I don't care. Let's find you an office. 
george,"...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; 
        the boom box incident. "
jerry, The boom box incident? 
george," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. 
        I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my 
        umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids 
        demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and 
        I chuck it in to the ocean. "
jerry, Seems reasonable. 
george," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them 
        out, not the kids. "
jerry, Even more reasonable. 
george," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I 
        pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the 
        hell out of there. "
jerry, And that guy is your new boss? 
george, Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. 
kramer," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? "
george, Yeah. 
kramer," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched 
        the Statue of Liberty job. "
jerry," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. "
george," It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. 
        I could go hog wild in there. "
kramer," You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple 
        of days and get it air brushed. "
george, Like retouched. 
kramer," You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. 
        Got that Ford right out of there. "
george," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to 
        work for him. "
kramer," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they 
        give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... "
kramer, I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years. 
jerry, Neither have I. 
kramer," Hey, our meat problems are solved. "
jerry, Where did you get this thing? 
kramer," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's 
        all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. "
elaine, Hey. 
kramer," Hey, spice.  Welcome to flavor 
        country. "
elaine," Yeah, that's pretty good. "
jerry," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met. "
elaine, Sara Sitarides? 
jerry, Mmhu. 
elaine, Oh... 
jerry, What's with you? 
elaine," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that 
        always smells like potatoes? "
jerry, Your whole building smells like potatoes. 
elaine," This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping 
        since 330 this morning. "
kramer," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit. 
      "
elaine, How do you do that? 
kramer," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and 
        I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser 
        rolls. "
jerry, I think we might have one left in the stock room. 
kramer, This hallway smells like potatoes. 
elaine," I know, I know, this is it.  "
kramer," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. 
        So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short 
        out the entire circuit. Here you go... "
elaine, I think I'll let you do it. 
kramer," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. "
elaine," No, I really don't want to. "
kramer," Well, I don't want to either. "
elaine, I thought you had done this before. 
kramer, It's just...it's no picnic. 
elaine," Well, how are we gonna do it? "
kramer," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it. "
kramer, Oh mama. 
elaine, Are you okay? 
kramer, I will lose that nail. 
sara," I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what 
        it's like to have someone's life depending on you. "
jerry," Well, I have this neighbor... "
sara," A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's 
        life? "
jerry, Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? 
sara, No. 
jerry, Cause I hit a whopper last week! 
clerk," Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky. "
george, What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. 
clerk, I thought you said you wanted to be out? 
george," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy! "
clerk, You've really lost a lot of hair. 
george, I am aware! 
elaine, The cat. 
jerry, He took out Kruger? 
george," I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this 
        guy can fix it up. "
kramer, This slicer is indomitable. 
jerry, Where did you get that butcher's coat? 
kramer," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything. "
elaine," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've 
        shut off the automatic feeder. "
kramer," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez. "
elaine, What did he do about it? 
kramer," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. "
elaine," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. "
kramer," Oh, that's a prickly one. "
elaine," Yeah, how's the doctor date? "
jerry," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, 
        if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. "
elaine," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life. "
jerry, Dermatology? 
elaine," Yes, she's a dermatologist. "
jerry," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe 
        on it. "
kramer," The slicer! Elaine, let's go. "
elaine, Where are we going? 
kramer, The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride. 
george, When are you going on your next date with her? 
jerry," Oh, what's the point? "
george," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that 
        aloe pusher in her place? "
jerry, Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. 
george," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away 
        working at the clinique counter! "
jerry, Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor! 
george," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on! "
jerry, You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off. 
george," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go 
        to a fancy dinner, flowers... "
jerry, Flowers? 
george," Yeah, you gotta do it classy  
      "
jerry," So, you've done this? "
george," Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time. 
      "
kramer, I think we are looking half a millimeter. 
elaine, Can it cut that thin? 
kramer," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. "
elaine, How did you know you cut it? 
kramer," Well, I guess I just assumed. "
elaine," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. "
kramer," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. "
elaine," Alright, let's do it. "
kramer," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide... "
elaine," Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that; 
        it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? "
kramer," Oh no, I don't think so. "
elaine, Why not? 
kramer," Well, you're not checked at on it. "
elaine, What do I have to know? 
kramer," Well, where the meat goes? "
elaine, Right there. 
kramer, Where do you turn it on? 
elaine, Right there. 
kramer," But where does the meat go? <br/>
<br/>
         "
sara," Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice. "
jerry," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? "
sara, It's fine. 
jerry," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! "
sara, What is with you? 
jerry, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! 
parry, Dr. Sitarides? 
sara," Mr. Parry, how are you? "
parry, I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. 
jerry, She saved your life? 
parry, I had skin cancer. 
jerry, Skin cancer! Damn. 
elaine," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, 
        yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye. <br/>
         "
elaine, These heals are so uneven.  
clerk, Here you Mr. Costanza. 
george, What is this? This is a drawing. 
clerk," Looks real, doesn't it? "
george, This is a cartoon! 
clerk," Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think 
        that's damn good. "
george," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! "
clerk, Then you better get a camera. 
jerry, He looks like a Peanuts character. 
george," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo 
        of Kruger. "
jerry, You can do that. 
george, Without his shirt on. 
jerry," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you. 
      "
george, It seemed so disorganized. 
jerry, I understand. 
george," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, 
        a lot of tradition. "
jerry," True. You mean, for you? "
george, I think. 
jerry, What about your sea sickness? 
george, Maybe I could be a land guy. 
jerry, I don't know if they have land guys. 
george," Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place! 
      "
elaine, Pliers? 
jerry, Drawer. 
elaine, Got it. 
jerry, What are they for? 
elaine, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. 
jerry, Come again? 
elaine," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, 
        okay? He has very strong feelings for it. "
george, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? 
jerry," Eh, it went okay. "
george," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? "
jerry," Yeah, I started out real classy... "
george," Yeah you did, you classed it up! "
jerry, But then I found out about the skin cancer. 
george," Oh, so it backfired? "
jerry, Yeah. 
george," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. "
elaine," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was 
        doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists 
        do. "
jerry," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. "
george," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? "
elaine, Aha. 
george, Could she do that at Kruger? 
elaine," I don't know, I guess. "
george," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, 
        I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. "
elaine, You have a little thing for this fella'? 
george," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. "
jerry, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! 
george," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. "
jerry, Must I? 
george," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do. "
jerry, How does that reflect me? 
kramer," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. "
elaine," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. "
kramer," Ok, I'll go with you. "
elaine," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first 
        stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns. "
kramer," Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...hate clowns...the 
        clowns. "
jerry," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life 
        saving doctor and I'm just a comedian... "
sara," Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because 
        I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off. "
jerry, Was it pimple popper MD? 
sara, That's the one.  
jerry, Still got it. 
elaine," Out, damn heal! "
kramer, Elaine? 
elaine, Kramer? 
kramer," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back. "
elaine, Just hold on! 
kramer," Hey, what's going on? "
elaine," Nothing... Here, 
        ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone... "
kramer," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine! "
elaine, Phone call! I'm in a big phone call! 
kramer," Come on, this is important!  "
neighbor," Hey, get the hell out of here! "
kramer," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. "
kramer," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing 
        it out for me. "
jerry, What the hell is this? 
kramer," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing 
        a fake beard? "
jerry, No. 
kramer," Well, what have you been doing? "
jerry," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office 
        and apologized... "
kramer," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there? "
jerry," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well... "
kramer," There, there's your hives. "
jerry," What, she gave me hives? "
kramer," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill. "
jerry, She did kind of touch my face. 
kramer," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell 
        her that you're not a test tube pin cushion. "
jerry," It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her. 
      "
kramer," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my 
        blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. "
elaine," Oh, that's fantastic. "
george," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted 
        me to take a photograph for the record. "
sara, What record? 
george," His personal file, I, I don't ask... "
sara, Jerry? What brings you here? 
jerry," I don't know, this?  "
sara, Looks like hives. 
jerry, Where do you suppose that could've come from? 
george," Jerry, what are you doing... "
kramer, He is just setting the record straight. 
jerry," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science 
        do you practice? "
sara, Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose? 
jerry," I want the antidote, pimple popper! "
sara," That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane. "
jerry, Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! 
george," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry! "
kruger," Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here? "
george," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. 
        Be right with you. "
kramer," Doc, huh? "
george," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're 
        a doctor and check this guy for moles. "
kramer," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin. "
george," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off. "
kramer," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you? "
george," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick... "
elaine, This is it. I can take this anymore. 
kramer," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh 
        indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. 
        So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not 
        that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, 
        so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my 
        on that. "
kruger, How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand? 
kramer," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their 
        own moles. Freckles that cover two men. "
kruger," So, how am I looking? "
kramer," Oh, so far, so good... yeuye... 
      "
george," Kramer, I really owe you one. "
kramer," George, we got a problem. "
george, What? 
kramer," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. "
george," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone 
        else. "
kramer," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send 
        him to another doctor? "
george," Because, you're not a dermatologist. "
kramer," He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what 
        I wanna do; I think I can get a section... "
george," Whoa, whoa, a section?! "
kramer," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... "
george," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss... "
kramer," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. "
george, No! Absolutely Not! 
kramer," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. 
        And it's going in my chart. "
elaine," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I 
        need someone to come over here right away! "
neighbor, Turn it off! Turn it off! 
elaine," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax! "
neighbor," Alright, that's it! "
elaine," Yeah, the address is 78th West... "
neighbor," Oh, oh mama... "
jerry," So, Kramer pulled it off? "
george," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks 
        to you. "
jerry," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks 
        like I had a beard of bees! "
george, Why don't you see someone about it? 
jerry," I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist 
        in this town?  A real dermatologist. "

      "
kramer," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now 
        we gotta came clean. "
george," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing. 
      "
kramer, I don't want this on my conscience. 
george," I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this. 
      "
kramer," Yeah, alright... "
jerry," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. "
kramer," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts. 
      "
jerry," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, 
        a common ingredient in metal cleaners. "
kramer," Well, that's weird. "
jerry, What are you doing? 
kramer," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. "
jerry," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! 
        That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's 
        from Dr. Van Nostrand! "
kramer," So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving 
        you. "
jerry," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you  "
kramer," Ohh, that's toxic.  
        Ououou.... "
kruger," George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy 
        did we take it on the chin last year. "
george," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand 
        and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. 
      "
kruger, I'm not too worried about it. 
george," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked 
        out. "
kruger," George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. 
        That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, 
        eh? "
george, Whatever. 
kruger," Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach 
        and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, 
        my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear 
        shaped loser. "
george," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, 
        until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out 
        of there! "
kruger," Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair. "
george, That's what they tell me! 
kramer, Do you want more pastrami? 
elaine," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good. 
      "
kramer," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? "
jerry, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. 
george," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have 
        you seen other dermatologist? "
jerry," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really 
        bad. "
george, What did he give you for it. 
jerry, Aloe. So where's that lock smith?

              now. Jerry or me?"
nina,  Alright.. Neither.

jerry, Just go back and ask him again. 
kramer, Yeah.. 
fdr, That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.
kramer," Well, why?"
fdr,  I have my reasons.

              gown will give her some support."
elaine, Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this  today.

elaine, What call?
jerry,"  He wants me to set him 
              up with this girl, Nina Stengal."

              girl.  The one you think can replace

george,  Told me the same thing.
jerry,"  Nina, Hi. It's Jerry."
george, You-you sure you never slept with her?  Perfect.

               Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?"
jerry, Are you?
george," Well, what's the reason?"
jerry, We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.
george, How engrossing?
jerry," If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in 
              Nina and not lose a step."
george," Wow! Heh.  You don't, huh, have a replacement 
              lined up for me, do ya?"
jerry," Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition 
              from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need 
              an awkward pause."

elaine,"  Oh, nothing for me.  I'm 
              going to ""Atomic Sub"" later."
jerry," ""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?"
elaine," I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 
              24 stamps, and I become a submarine  captain."
jerry, What does that mean?
elaine,  Free sub.
elaine, What?
george, Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
elaine," What is it?  ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" 
              What is Festivus?"
george," It's nothing, stop it.."
jerry, When George was growing up..
george,"  Jerry, No!"
jerry, His father..
george, No!
jerry," Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, 
              so he made up his own holiday."
elaine, Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
george,  Alright..
jerry," And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum 
              pole?"
george, Jerry! Stop it!
jerry," And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended 
              up with you crying?"

              now?! "

              card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it 
              when I gave it to denim vest!"
jerry, So?
elaine," I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a 
              long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!"
jerry," No, you walk out."
elaine," Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish 
              it."
jerry," No, you wait for the movie!"
elaine,"  I want that free 
              sub."
jerry," You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, 
              it's all computerized!  They're cloning sheep now."
kramer,"  No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same 
              sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a 
              handkerchief on the old Dean"
jerry," So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see 
              if he's called it?"
elaine, That's a good idea.
kramer,"  Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! 
              Bye.  Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm 
              going back to work."

kramer," Yeah, H&amp;H Bagels. That's where I worked."
jerry, You?
elaine, Worked?
jerry, Bagels?
kramer," Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.  Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years."
elaine," Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but 
              I haven't seen them in a long time."
kramer," Yeah, well, H&amp;H wouldn't let us use their bath room 
              while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity."
elaine, What were your.. demands?
kramer," Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now."
elaine, I believe that's the new minimum wage.
kramer," Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got 
              to go. "
jerry, Why didn't you ever mention this?
kramer," Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's 
              embarrassing!  "

manager, I could use someone for the holidays..
kramer," Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!  What are those?"

              to see that.."

              fake."
bookie," So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you 
              for 5 years."
elaine," So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give 
              him my real number.."
bookie,"  Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes."
charlie, Elaine Benes?!
bookie," You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie 
              here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man."

jerry,"  ""A donation has been made in your name 
              to the Human Fund."" - What is that?"
george,  Made it up.
jerry,"  ""The Human Fund. Money for people."""

george,  The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
jerry, ..Yeah.
kramer," Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!"
jerry, How was your first day?
kramer," Oh, fantastic!  
              It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough."

              them. (Jerry and George"
george," Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. "
jerry, Happy Festivus!
kramer, What's Festivus?
jerry, When George was growing up..
george,  No!
jerry, His father..
george," Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father 
              invented. It doesn't exist!"
elaine," Happy Festivus, Georgie."
kramer, Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
elaine," Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if 
              a guy calls H&amp;H and he's looking for me, you take a message."
jerry, You're still trying to gget that free sub?
elaine," Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot 
              of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all 
              away now."
jerry, Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
elaine, Maybe.
,
frank," Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus 
              in years! What is your interest?"
kramer," Well, just tell me everything, huh?"
frank," Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I 
              reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained 
              blows opon him, I realized"
kramer, What happened to the doll?
frank," It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. 
              ""A Festivus for the rest of us!"""
kramer, That musta been some kind of doll.

frank," And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, 
              and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the 
              past year."
kramer, Is there a tree?
frank," No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. 
              I find tinsel distracting."
kramer," Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right 
              where I itch."
frank," Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out 
              of the crawl space. "
elaine," Hello, Frank."
frank," Hello, woman. "
elaine, Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
kramer," No.  Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 
              23rd off."
manager," Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is 
              the holidays."
kramer, But it's Festivus.
manager, What?
kramer," You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new 
              holidays.."
manager, That's not a right.
kramer," Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. 
              Come on Elaine.  It's 
              a walk out!"
elaine," No, I got to stay here and wait for the call."

gwen, Hey.
jerry," Boy, am I glad to see you."
gwen, You were expecting someone else?
jerry, You never know.
gwen,"  You know, you might want to take the tunnel."
jerry," So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?"
gwen, I can go either way.
jerry,  You're telling me.
,
george," So, she was switching? Back and forth?"
jerry," Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that 
              back booth over there."
george," So, just bring her here. This is all you really need."
jerry," I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, 
              what if things, you know, progress?"
george, Lights out.
jerry," Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee 
              shop. Nice cuff links, by the way."
george,"  Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this 
              Human Fund is a gold mine!"
jerry," That's not a french cuff shirt, you know."
george," I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter 
              opener."
jerry," Oh, that's classy."
kramer," Well, Happy Festivus."
george, What is that? Is taht the pole?!
frank," George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you 
              are."
george,  That's why I hate it.
kramer," There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's 
              invited."
frank," George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to 
              us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, 
              George as a child celebrating"
frank, Read that poem.
george,  I can't read it. I need my glasses!
frank," You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!"
estelle, Leave him alone!
frank," Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength."
george, No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!  I hate Festivus!
frank, We had some good times.
gwen, Hey.
jerry," I there. This is Kramer, and Frank."
gwen, Hi.
kramer,  Hello.
gwen," So, you ready to go?"
jerry," Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.

manager,"  Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll 
              make you a sandwich."
elaine,"  I want the one that I earned.  I'll 
              get it. I'll get it!  H&amp;H, and Elaine."
kramer,"  Elaine, you 
              should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. 
              It's going down."
elaine, What did you do?
kramer, You've been warned.
elaine," Oh, hi! "
worker," Hey, the steam valve's broke."
manager, Can we still make bagels?
worker, Sure. It's just a little steamy.
kramer, Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
,
kruger," George, I got something for you.  I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's 
              money at it. They all"
george, 20 thousand dollars?
kruger," Made out to the Human Fund.  Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. 
              Oh well. I'm going home."
,
gwen," Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?"
jerry, Why? It's our place.
gwen, I just found a rubber band in my soup.
jerry, Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
george," Hey! Surprise, surprise!"
jerry," Hey, Georgie!"
gwen, I think I'm just gonna go.
jerry, I'll be here.
george,"  Hey, soup."
jerry, She didn't touch it.
george," Ohh.. Paco!  Hey, 
              take a look at this. "
jerry, 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
george, I don't know.
jerry, Excuse me?
george," I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance 
              to start giving something back."
jerry," You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand 
              dollars."
george, I'm serious.
jerry, You're going to start your own charity?
george," I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! 
              I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they 
              would come to me.. and"
,
elaine," Kramer, the vest just called."
kramer,"  Yama - Hama! It's fright 
              night!"
elaine," Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, 
              I'm gonna have my hands on that ""Atomic Sub"" card."
kramer, And?
elaine,  Free sub.  I'll see ya.
kramer, Yeah.
gwen," Kramer, Hi!"
kramer," Oh, hello."
gwen, It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.
kramer, Ah-huh.
gwen," I'm dating your friend, Jerry.."
kramer," Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's 
              girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and 
              like, a foot taller."
gwen," That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's 
              afraid of getting caught."
kramer," Oh, he's a tomcat."
elaine, Steve.
elaine, It's Elaine.
elaine, Yeah.
elaine, I see you're still sticking with the denim.  Do you have that card that I gave you?
elaine," No, no, no. You give me your number."
elaine, No.
elaine, No.
elaine, A fake number! Blimey!
,
kruger," George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting 
              telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund."
george," Well, there could be."
kruger, But there isn't.
george," Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. 
              "
kruger," George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those 
              donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why 
              you gave me a fake"
george," Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I 
              don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus."
kruger, Vemonous?
george," Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted 
              for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!"
kruger," Are you making all this up, too?"
george," Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove 
              it - if I had to."
kruger," Yeah, you probably should."
,
george, Happy Festivus!
frank," George? This is a surprise.  Who's the 
              suit?"
george," Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger."
frank," Have you seen the pole, Kruger?"
george," Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole."
frank, He's gonna see it.
george, Happy Festivus!  Yama - Hama!
elaine, I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
george, Embracing my roots.
jerry, They nailed you on the 20 G's?
george, Busted cold.
frank, It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
kruger, I find your belief system fascinating.
kramer," Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!  Hee, hee, hee!"
bookie," Hello again, Miss Benes."
elaine, What are you doing here?
bookie," Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you 
              out, and, uh, we got this bagel place.."
kramer,"  I told them I was just about to see 
              you.. It's a Festivus miracle!"
estelle, Dinner's ready!
frank, Let's begin.
kramer, Uh.. that's right.
frank," Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with 
              the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! 
              And now you're gonna hear"
george," Oh, God."
frank,"  Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, 
              you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. 
              I lost my train of thought."
gwen, Jerry!
jerry, Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
gwen, Kramer told me.
kramer, Another Festivus miracle!
gwen, I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.
elaine," Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break."
jerry," Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!  Bad lighting 
              on the porch."
elaine,"  Hey, how'd my horse do?"
bookie, He had to be shot.
frank," And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength."
george, Not the feats of strength..
frank," This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer."
kramer," Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to 
              work a double shift at H&amp;H."
jerry, I thought you were on strike?
kramer," Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. 
              Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little  out there."
george, Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
kruger,  How about George?
frank," Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus 
              is not over!"
george," Oh, please, somebody, stop this!"
frank,  Let's rumble!
estelle," I think you can take him, Georgie!"
george," Oh, come on! Be sensible."
frank," Stop crying, and fight your father!"
george," Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!"
frank, This is the best Festivus ever!

george," When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?"
jerry," Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.."
george," Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was 
              right around the corner."
jerry, I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
george, No. That's just electric.
jerry," What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. 
              That was a cool one."
george,"  What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang 
              Bang?"
jerry," Well, what do you think the big holdup is? "
george," The government is very touchy about us being in the air. 
              Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in 
              the air is a big production. "
jerry," Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? "
george, And the underwater bubble cities? 
jerry, It's like we're living in the '50s here. 
kramer, It's good suspension! 
jerry,"  Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time 
              to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. 
               "
george," What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the 
              car.  You're not sure what you want. You don't even know 
              why you're here. "
jerry,"  There's that 
              vein again. "
george, I'm starving. We should have had lunch first.. 
jerry,"  It'll be twenty minutes. I 
              told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. "
george," Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought 
              he was a mechanic. "
jerry, I guess he graduated. 
george," That's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back 
              to screwin' you right to your face. "
jerry,  Thank you. 
george," Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh?  
              Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, 
              dealer prep. Sudeenly, youre"
jerry, Alright. Calm down. 
george," My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him 
              up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of 
              in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All"
kramer," Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right. 
            "
jerry,"  Alright, were goin in. "
salesman," Youve got a good eye, there. I see youve 
              noticed the uni-body construction. Im Rick. Are you looking 
              to buy or lease? "
kramer," Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be 
              buying.. "
rick, Maybe I should talk to him. 
kramer," Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. 
              You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in. "
rick," I see. So, youre his manag-"
kramer," Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont 
              we take this boiler out for a shakedown? "
george," Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear 
              is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, ""Ill 
              walk out of here right now!"" "
salesman, Can I help you with something? 
george,"  Hold it! One more step and were walkin! 
            "
jerry,"  George.  Sorry, were just 
              waiting for David Puddy. "
george,"  He is. You dont know what Im 
              doin here. "
elaine, Hey. 
jerry, Hey. 
puddy, Sorry Im late. 
elaine,"  My new salesman boyfriend took me out to 
              celebrate his promotion. "
jerry, Ah. Whered you go? 
elaine,"  Uh, to a restaurant. "
puddy, Arbys. 
elaine, I had the roast beef.. 
jerry," So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 
              convertible. "
puddy, Alright. Classic.  High-five. 
elaine,"  David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine 
              is? "
puddy," Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room  right there. 
            "
elaine, Oh.  
puddy,"  Hey, come on, guys. Ill show 
              you the 900. "
george,"  Yeah, you show us the 900. "
rick," .. And look at these features, Mr. Kramer Anti-lock breaks, 
              automatic climate control. Uh,  make 
              a right at this corner, please."
kramer," No. No, I didnt. "
rick," Well, thats okay.  Well make this next 
              right, and swing around to get back to the dealership. "
kramer,"  Well, its a test drive, right? 
              I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, 
              I need to see that itll handle my daily"
rick, So where are we going? 
kramer," Just a little place I like to call, ""Youll see"".

 ,
george," Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you 
              use to soften people up? "
puddy,  By the service department.
george,"  Alright, remember no 
              rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble. 
            "
jerry,"  Au revoir, Le George. 
            "
george, Dont think it cant happen!  
jerry," So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 
              ""grease monkey"". "
puddy, I dont care for that term. 
jerry," Oh. Sorry, I didnt know.. "
puddy," No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart 
              a fuel injector. "
jerry, I saw one once that could do sign language. 
puddy," Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko. "
jerry," Yeah, Koko. "
puddy," Right, Koko. That chimps alright.  
              High-five. "
george," Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here?  
              You didnt agree to anything, did ya? "
jerry, No. We both just saw the same monkey. 
george,"  Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were 
              none left. "
puddy,"  Well, theres a vending machine. I could 
              show you where it is. "
george,"  Hey, gimme a dollar. "
jerry,  Wheres your money? 
george,  Im here helpin you.
elaine, Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken. 
george,"  Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want 
              you to think. "
jerry," Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed 
              an annoying little habit? "
elaine,  The squinting? 
jerry, No. 
elaine,  The staring? 
jerry, No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. 
elaine, I thought all guys do that. 
jerry," Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. 
              In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre using sign 
              language now. "
elaine, Is that bad? 
jerry, What do you think the Nazis were doin?  That was the heil-five. 
elaine,"  Isnt that from your act, like, ten 
              years ago? "
jerry,"  It was a good bit in the 80s, 
              and its still relatable today. "
puddy," Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. 
               High-five. "
elaine," Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the 
              copy machine? "
puddy,  You owe me five. 
 ,
george, Twix..  B-5. 
george," Ah, come on! "
george," Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar? "
mechanic,  No. 
george," Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar? "
mechanic,  Dont have one. 
george,"  Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet 
              was open, I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice 
              that you had several crisp dollar"
mechanic,  Youre incorrect. 
george,"  Perhaps you could look again, please? Im 
              very hungry. "
mechanic,  We had donuts earlier. 
george,"  I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old 
              screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job!  Ho,"
 ,
rick," Mr. Kramer, were really not allowed to use the cars 
              to run errands. "
kramer," No, look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, 
              that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement.  Oooh, Lets see if"
 ,
jerry,  I think the candy comes out over there. 
george," People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre 
              too lazy to pick it up. "
jerry," Either that, or theyve got a little hang-up about 
              lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier? 
            "
george," The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like 
              to be. "
jerry, How much was under there? 
george,"  I think somethin bit me. 
              I just need another nickel. "
jerry,"  Hey, Puddy 
              thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think?  "
george," Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling 
              his big fish in! "
jerry," Hey, can I have my dollar back? "
george,  Its wrinkled. Its worthless. 
george,"  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Come on!"
man, They just put out some more donuts. 
george, They did? 
man,  Last one. 
 ,
kramer," Well, just one more errand and we can head back. "
rick," Actually, it looks like were gonna need some gas. "
kramer," Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now? 
            "
rick,"  Well, its on ""E"". "
kramer," You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and 
              I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. 
              But, for a variety of reasons, I"
rick,"  So, you want to know how far you can drive 
              your friends car for free. "
kramer,"  Well, I make it 
              up to him in other ways. "
 ,
george," As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains 
              dangling in the machine.  Hey, its gone."
salesman," Well, how do you know that ones yours? "
george," Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! 
              He mustve bought one, and gotten both. "
salesman," Sir, are you gonna buy a car? "
george," No!  Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is 
              my Twix! (The mechanic eats"
puddy, Paper jam.. Got it!  High-five.  On the flip side. 
elaine," David, um, I.. "
puddy,  Dont leave me hangin
elaine," Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is.. its 
              very grease monkey. "
puddy, What did I tell you about that? 
elaine," Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid. "
puddy,"  Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats 
              stupid. You. Stupid. "
elaine," Well, that is really mature. "
puddy, Yeah? So are you. 
elaine, Huh? 
puddy, Youre the grease monkey. 
elaine,"  Uh.. 
              that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving. "

jerry,  Hey! Wh-where are you..? 
puddy, Lets finish this up. 
jerry, Did you two break up? 
puddy,"  That chicks 
              whacked. Were history.  I just left 
              out a couple of things"

puddy,"  
              Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finders 
              fee"
jerry," ""Finders fee""? It was on the lot! "
puddy," Yeah, thats right.  Floor mats, 
              keys.. "
jerry," Keys""?! "
puddy, How ya gonna start it? 
 ,
george," Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. 
              And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, 
              and you never bothered"
mechanic," First of all, it wasnt a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue 
              bar. "
george," Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. That was no 
              5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of 
              your lip! Now, that-that-that is a"
mechanic," Yeah, its just a little nougat. "
george," Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in 
              my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, lets 
              not just say things that are obvious"
mechanic,"  You know, youre 
              gettin a little vein there.. "
george,"  I know about the vein! I 
              cant believe this guy.. "
jerry," Hey, George! "
george," Hey, starving!  "
jerry," No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and 
              Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular 
              customer, now! "
george," I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, 
              ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres now laws in 
              this place. Anything goes! Its"
saleswoman, Is someone helping you? 
george, Stay back! 
 ,
rick,  Where is it now? 
kramer," Theres still some overlap between the needle and 
              the slash below the ""E"". "
rick, How long are you gonna go? 
kramer," Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. 
              Youll get used to it. Just,  get it 
              out of your mind. "
rick, Have you ever been completely below the slash? 
kramer," Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came 
              to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont 
              know who did it, and I never got to"

              this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you 
              want to play hard ball, I got my"
george," Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know 
              the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. 
              Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?! "
jerry," George! Can we focus on the car, here? "
george," Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against 
              my spine. "
puddy,"  Jerry, I just need your 
              signature, here, and well get you that yellow car ready to 
              go. "
jerry, Yellow? I wanted black. 
puddy, I cant give you black at that price.
jerry,"  George, could you help me, please? "
george,  Yes. This is wrong! 
jerry," Sing it, sister! "
george," Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..! 
            "
jerry,  Uhhh.. 
george,"  ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, 
              Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this! "
jerry,  Ill be right back.

kramer," No, Sir. We are down there. "
rick," Oh, this is amazing! Oh, Ive never felt so alive! "
kramer," Yeah, well, alright. Im satisfied. We better get 
              some gas. "
rick," What? Well, we cant stop now. "
kramer, What do you mean? 
rick," We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. 
              That was the plan. "
kramer, There was no plan. 
rick," Well, lets make it the plan! Lets just.. go for 
              it! Like Thelma and Louise. "
kramer," What, they drove to a dealership? "

              to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow 
              now! "

              deal. "
elaine,"  You know, just that you cared enough to call 
              means so much, Jerry. "

              flush my money down the toilet? "
willie," Sir, what, exactly, is the problem? "
george," One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix 
              candy bar! "
willie," Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you? 
            "
george," He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered 
              in chocolate and cookie crumbs. "
willie, I thought you said it was a Twix. 
george," Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar. "
willie, Maybe it was. 
george," Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. 
            "
willie," What about the $100,000 bar? "
george, No. Rice and caramel. 
willie, Nougat?

willie, Positive? 
george, Please.

              Grand? "
george," All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and 
              for him to be fired!"
man, Whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
george, They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! 
willie," Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you dont 
              talk. "
woman,"  You make your father sit here all 
              day? "
willie, He likes it! 
george," Alright! Do you mind? I have the window!  Now, 
              what are you gonna do about my Twix? "
man,  Twix has too much coconut.

              get us a couple of Twix bars. "
rick," No, no coconut for me. "
kramer," Alright, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine

rick, Ahh! 
kramer," No, man! Not the gas! "
rick," But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad! "
kramer," Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause 
              it wont! "
rick,"  Ah, you can just go on without me. "
kramer," Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, 
              and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone 
              says, ""Kramer and that"
rick, Maybe we better get moving. 
kramer," Its good to have you back, Stan. "
rick," Its Rick, by the way. "

              bar, as he claimed, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem 
              picking one out from a"

george," Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars 
              with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select 
              from. "
willie, It took you an hour? 
george," Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. 
              And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens 
              a door to a back room."
saleswoman," Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy! "
george," Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! 
              Theyre - theyre all on the floor! "
george," And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! 
              Like, 8 Twix?! "
mechanic, No. 
man," Hey, this Clark bar is good. "
george," Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! 
              A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed 
              me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix! "
mechanic, Theyre all gone.

              Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx! "
elaine, What was that? 
puddy, Theres a mental hospital right near here. 
jerry," Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in 
              principle Arbys - no more than once a month. In exchange, 
              Elaine comes to your softball game, and"
elaine,"  Yeah, 
              well, thats not bad. "
puddy, I can live with that. 
jerry," So, youre back together? "
puddy, Yeah. 
jerry," Alright, alright. Alright, thats enough! Lets 
              get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats just a rip-off, 
              isnt it, David? "
puddy," Oh, we dont even know what it is. "
jerry," So, Im gettin the insiders deal? "
puddy, Insiders deal.  High-five. 
 ,
rick,  Theres the dealer! 
kramer, Hey! 
rick," We did! We pulled it off! I cant believe it! Wheres 
              the needle? "
kramer," Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo! "
rick," Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things 
              are gonna be different for me now. "
kramer," Well, thats a weird thing to say.. "
rick, I wonder how much longer we could have lasted. 
kramer," Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm. "

cabbie, Caprice Classic. 
elaine,"  You couldnt just give him one high-five? 
            "
jerry," And where does it end? Then, everyones doin 
              it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase,

george,  This Arbys is good. 
elaine," So, George, I still dont understand - how was that 
              a setup? "
jerry," And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic 
              or the manager? "
george,"  I dont know. All of em. 
              Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different 
              candy bars, anyway. "
george, What was that? 
jerry, I think theres a mental hospital near here. 
elaine, Very near. 
kramer," Whew! Well, I think we stopped. "
rick, You - you can probably let go of my hand now.

waitress," Careful, this plate is extremely hot."
elaine, Thank you. Ow!
waitress, I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
elaine, I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
puddy," Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?"
elaine," I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing 
              that?"
puddy, It's my winter coat.
elaine, A fur?
puddy, Is there a problem?
elaine, A seemingly infinite supply.
elaine," Ow! Careful, it's hot."
puddy, Ow!
jerry," So, Puddy wear's a man fur?"
elaine, He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
jerry," And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible."
elaine," Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This 
              is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot."
george, And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
elaine, We never dated in winter.
jerry, You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
elaine," Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw 
              that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift."
george," An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people 
              for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like 
              one month off."
jerry," Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' 
              him."
george," All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I 
              will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have 
              a sixth sense."
jerry, Cheapness is not a sense.
elaine," I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second 
              you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a 
              favor? Can you keep an eye on the"
jerry," I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the 
              music. I turned that mother out."
kramer, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
kramer, You got any pliers?
jerry," What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?"
newman, Hilarious.
kramer," Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So 
              you can see in."
elaine, Why?
newman, To prevent an ambush.
kramer," Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to 
              jack me with a sock full of pennies."
jerry, But then anyone can just look in and see you.
kramer," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, 
              if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 
              'Enjoy the show.'"
elaine, I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
jerry," Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the 
              way."
kramert, Mmm... Nice wallet.
newman, Wallet.
jerry, What?
kramer," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with 
              powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of 
              cards and your bankroll."
jerry, That's a five.
kramer," I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio..."
silvio," Eh, what are you doing?"
kramer," Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole."
silvio," Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the 
              super. Who said you could do that?"
kramer," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?"
silvio, Like what?
kramer," Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back."
silvio," No, no, no, no. No, that's all right."
kramer," Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--"
silvio," Newman? He did this, too?"
kramer," Well, yeah."
silvio, I deal with him.
george," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're 
              gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper."
jerry, Except the store's in Delaware.
george, I'll have 'em overnight it.
jerry," Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without 
              this big wallet. It's more comfortable."
george, It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
jerry, Why?
george," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull 
              for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for 
              your money."
jerry," But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow 
              here than here."
george, I need everything in there.
jerry, Irish money?
george, I might go there.
jerry," Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to 
              get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster."
george," All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet 
              &amp; Lows."
kramer, Who is it?
newman, It's Newman.
kramer, What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
newman, I can't believe I'm being evicted.
kramer, What? What are you talking about?
newman," The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and 
              I'm out of the building."
kramer," No. No, he can't do that."
newman," I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing 
              for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out 
              of a bucket."
kramer," Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten 
              this thing out."
newman," Uh, you, uh, you better put something on."
jerry," George, I am loving this no wallet thing."
george, A man carries a wallet.
jerry," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think 
              I'm onto something."
jerry," Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place."
george, Love to.
jerry, Music?
jerry, But I could do that and the music.
jerry, I was ready to get jiggy with it.
puddy, Hey.
jerry," Hey, Elaine."
elaine, Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
jerry," So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?"
elaine," So, George... did you get the chair?"
george," No, I don't have it yet."
jerry," So, we're givin' him nothing?"
george," No, I brought a picture of the chair."
jerry, Did you at least get him a card?
george, I thought we'd all sign the picture.
elaine," Hey, Joe Mayo."
elaine," Oh, fantastic."
puddy," Sure thing, Joe Mayo."
jerry," Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?"
keri, Nice.
jerry,  It's working.  Don't tap on the glass.
george,  Joe Mayo's apartment?
puddy,"  Hey! 
              Cocktail off the speaker."
elaine," Goodbye, Dr. Zaius."
silvio, Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
kramer," Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. 
              Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, 
              and the furniture."
silvio," Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling."
kramer," Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?"
silvio, I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
kramer," Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, 
              and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, 
              but smart as a whip."
silvio," OK, on your word he can stay."
kramer, All right.
silvio, But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
kramer," Well, you won't regret it."
silvio, What's wrong?
elaine, Good working with you.
puddy," All right, let's hit the bricks."
elaine, What?
elaine, Oh. Uhhh...
elaine, So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
george, And you threw it out the window?
elaine, Mm-hmm.
george," God, you're like a rock star."
elaine, So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
jerry, Because you threw it out.
elaine," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane."
jerry, But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
elaine," But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody 
              stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible."
jerry, But that's you.
elaine," So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though 
              I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway."
george," Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me."
jerry," Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing 
              cabinet under half of your ass."
george," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
elaine, Look at you. You're on a slant.
george," Here, just give me a couple of napkins."
george," There, there I'm fine."
jerry, What was that?
george, I think I had some hard candy in there.
george," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment."
george, Ahhh. How does this thing work?
george,Ahhhhh...
george, Ahhhhh...
keri, Ready to go?
jerry, All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
keri, You don't go that often?
jerry," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?"
keri, Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
jerry," Compact, lipstick, all this?"
keri, And can you help to carry my keys?
jerry," What are you, a medieval dungeon master?"
keri, And a tin of altoids.
jerry, Ow! Sharp key.
kramer," So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?"
newman," Well, there's very little sleeping going on."
kramer," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
newman," Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business."
kramer," Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, 
              if he catches you, we're both out."
newman," Hey, what is that up that tree?"
kramer," Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear."
newman," No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost."
kramer," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
newman, The Pacific Northwest.
elaine," So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal."
jerry," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, 
              and I want to keep that weight off."
elaine," You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would 
              be perfect for you."
jerry, Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
elaine, No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
jerry, I'm not carrying a purse.
elaine, It's not a purse. It's European.
jerry, Oh.
elaine," Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
jerry, I don't know.
elaine," If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a 
              gift, too."
george, Yeah?
jerry," Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
george, Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
jerry, What?
george, It's in... transit.
elaine, Did he get it?
jerry, No.
elaine," Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out."
jerry," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split 
              it three ways."
george, Allllll right!
jerry, What is that noise?
jerry," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being 
              completely honest with me."
kramer," Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak 
              hinge."
elaine," Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats."
kramer," Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free."
elaine, What are you talking about?
kramer," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman 
              found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed 
              lemur!"
elaine, 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
jerry, What was that pop sound?
kramer," Well, I had some hard candy in there."
newman," So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?"
elaine," Come in, come in."
newman," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from 
              this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
elaine," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about 
              something."
newman, This isn't about my opening your mail?
elaine, What?
newman," Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already 
              open."
elaine," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a 
              fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of 
              mine, and I'd like to give it back to him."
newman," Sorry. Climbers, keepers."
elaine," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and 
              I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered."
newman, You are?
elaine," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the 
              only one who's held down a steady job for several years."
newman," Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it."
elaine, Ha ha ha ha.
newman," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?"
elaine," Uh, don't worry, he's cool."
newman, Cool?
elaine," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little 
              favor, Newmie?"
newman," Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart 
              belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her."
elaine," All right, we're done here."
newman," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the 
              whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of 
              the apartment, where I would be"
elaine," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
keril, Nice carryall.
jerry, It's European.
keri, Do you still have my lipstick?
jerry," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. 
              Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't 
              he? So what was your job?"
keri, My job was to keep you away from the music.
jerry," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?"
keri, Guess not.
jerry, You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
silvio," Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I 
              can see you through the reverse peephole."
kramer," Hey, Silvio!"
silvio, Look at this.
kramer, Huh?
silvio," Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think 
              it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?"
kramer," Relax, Silvio."
silvio," No, that's it. You're both out of the building!"
kramer," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, 
              that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!"
silvio, A man's?
kramer, Yeah.
silvio, What kind of a man would wear fur?
kramer," Oh, lots of 'em."
silvio, Would you?
kramer, No.
silvio, Then who?
kramer, What about Jerry?
silvio, Jerry?
kramer," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot 
              of furs. They're desperate, insecure people."
silvio," Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, 
              look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!"
kramer," Yeah, something like that."
jerry, I have to do what?
kramer," All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's 
              yours."
jerry, I'm not wearing the fur.
kramer," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building."
jerry, Is that right?
kramer," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at 
              what your life will be like if I'm not around?"
jerry," Newman, too?"
kramer," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, 
              I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about."
jerry, That's my walkman!
kramer, And you'll get it back.
jerry, All right.
kramer," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one."
george, Hey.
kramer," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when 
              you gave it to me."
jerry," George, did you get that chair yet?"
george, It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
jerry, You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
george, Excuse me?
jerry," Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' 
              a gift from me."
george," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer 
              and I have to pay for the entire gift?"
kramer," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking 
              about?"
george," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? 
              It was your suggestion."
kramer," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never 
              heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up."
george," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?"
jerry," No, you don't have to buy anything."
george," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, 
              and now you're all screwin' me!"
jerry, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
george, I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
jerry, Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
george," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, 
              and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend."
jerry, Your good friend is morbidly obese.
george," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse."
jerry, It's not a purse. It's European!
kramer," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. 
              Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, 
              you pick up a paper, and you come"
jerry, All right.
kramer, There you go.
jerry, How do I look?
kramer, Ahh....

newman,"  They do have an intimate 
              knowledge of the street.."
kramer," They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap 
              something to them?!"
jerry,"  Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard 
              all day."
,
leo," Jerry, hello! "
jerry," So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?"
leo, I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
jerry,"  Yeah, yeah. But what about 
              money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?"
leo," What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money!  But I'm not."
jerry,"  Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday."
leo, Why didn't ya say hello?
jerry, Because you were too busy stealing a book.
leo,  You still say hello.
jerry,"  Leo, I saw you steal."
leo," Oh, they don't care. We all do it."
jerry," Who, criminals?"
leo, Senior citizens. No big deal.
jerry, You could get arrested.
leo," Arrested? Come on!  I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. 
              What's my name? Will you take me"
jerry,  Leo..
leo," Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point."
jerry,  Thank you.
leo,"  Will somebody 
              answer that damn phone?!"
,
elaine,"  Of course Zach and I have been 
              dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?"
walter, Well..
elaine," ""Well""? We've been dating for three months. Between 
              you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell."
elaine,  Oh man. Ugh..
walter,  Isn't that Zach?
elaine, Yeah.
walter, Aren't you upset?
elaine,"  Yes. Oh, man! Oh!"
,
kramer," Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked 
              out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for 
              are motivated,"
kramer,"  Because to pull rickshaws 
              means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned 
              upper body."
newman," Alright, who's first?"
krmaer, Hey.
newman," Name, please."
newman,  Rusty.
kramer,"  You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No 
              offence."
newman,"  Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the 
              block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what 
              you've got! Ok? Ready, and"
kramer,"  Giddy up! Good 
              form."
newman,"  Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're 
              gonna have to do this all day for very little money."
kramer," Hey, what's he doin'?"
newman, I think he stealing our rickshaw!
kramer," Well, then, he's out!"
,
george," Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book."
cashier,"  I'm sorry, we 
              can't take this book back."
george, Why not?
cashier, It's been flagged.
george,  Flagged?
cashier, It's been in the bathroom.
george, It says that on the computer?
cashier, Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.
george,"  Well, you just lost a lot of business! 
              Because I love to read!"
jerry,"  I don't believe this!  Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's 
              having a little problem with"
guard, Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?
jerry,"  He's over there in the overcoat. If you could 
              just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight.."
gaurd,"  We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. 
              All units respond."
jerry," '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?"
guard," Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and 
              let us handle this.  Swarm! Swarm!"
leo, What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
guard, You're under arrest.
jerry,  I just wanted you to scare him.
leo," Jerry, you ratted me out?!"
jerry,"  
              Hello?"
leo, Hello.
,
jerry," Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard 
              to scare him straight."
helen," Jerry, he won't last a day in prison."
jerry,  Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
morty, She's got priors.
jerry,  Prior convictions? Leo?
helen, It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
morty," Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need."
jerry,  What does that mean?
helen, Nobody pays for everyting.
jerry,  You're stealing too?!
morty," Nothing. Batteries.  Well, they wear out so 
              quick."
jerry," Mom, you too?"
helen," Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them."
jerry," Alright, I'll talk to you later."
kramer,"  Well, 
              the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted."
jerry,"  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all 
              homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months."
kramer,"  See, we should've gotten some collateral from 
              him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans."
newman," We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. 
              I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords."
jerry, To the Idiotmobile!
,
jerry," So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, 
              he's cheating on you?"
elaine," That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand 
              up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and 
              I'm the office-"
jerry,  Tina Turner?
elaine,  Alright.
george," Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in 
              every database in town!"
jerry, Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
george," I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try 
              on pants."
jerry,  Not underpants.
elaine," Hey, that's your Uncle Leo."
jerry,  Uncle Leo. Hello!
leo,  Jerry.
jerry,"  Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know 
              about your.. past."
leo,"  You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays 
              me, I never forget!"
jerry,"  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!"
elaine," French impressionism. Oh, I love this.  
              Now, what is the problem with this book?"
george, Nothing.
elaine, How much do you want for it?
george," You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five."
jerry, Leo's furious.  What is that doing on the table?
george,"  Jerry, simmer down."
jerry,"  I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that 
              book."
elaine,  What is wrong with this book?
george, Simmer!
jerry," That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the 
              bathroom with him and-"
elaine,"  Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming 
              through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs"
george,"  
              May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?"
jerry, I don't read in the bathroom.
george," Well, aren't you something?"
,
peterman," Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover."
elaine,"  Oh yes. I know all about his little 
              performance in the break room."
peterman," Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room 
              to nibble on a love newton?"
elaine,  Love newton?
peterman," I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap."
elaine," An addict?  Well, it just keeps getting better!"
peterman," And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the 
              one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled 
              his head with pseudoerotic"
elaine," Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning 
              on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!"
peterman," Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. 
              Now, he is going cold turkey.  And you will be at his 
              side."
elaine," Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-"
peterman,"  No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you 
              of your 'associate' status.  Uh, P.S., the first 
              twenty-four hours are the worst."
,
helen, It was a crime of passion.
leo," If anyone betrays me, I never forget."
helen, He won't last a day in prison.
leo,"  
              Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right,"
jerry, Hello?
elaine," Hey, it's me."
jerry, Uncle Leo?
elaine,"  Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?"
jerry, Nightmares. You?
elaine, My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
zach,  I'm burning up! Elaine!
elaine, Eat your soup!
jerry," You're not feeding him, are you?"
elaine," Why?  I told you, 
              away from the curtains. Away.  Use your bucket. (He vomits 
              again - this time into the"
kramer," Hey, buddy."
jerry,  Ah! Kramer!
kramer, I thought I heard you.
jerry, Get out of here!
newman,  Kramer? Kramer?  There you are.
jerry, Will everybody please leave?!
newman," I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in 
              Battery Park."
kramer, Our rickshaw?
newman, It's entirely possible.
jerry, I want everyone out!
kramer,"  Let's talk in Jerry's 
              kitchen. I'll make some cocoa."
newman,  Good night.
jerry,"  Good night, Newman."
,
newman, There it is!
kramer, Rusty!
rusty," Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job?"
kramer,"  Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you.  Let's get this baby home."
newman, Uh..
kramer, What?
newman," You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for 
              us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after 
              all, it is a conveyance."
kramer," Yes, that's true."
newman," So, which one of us is gonna pull?"
kramer," Well, there's only one way to settle this.  
              One spot, two spot,"
newman,  Yeah.
kramer," Best two out of three?  One spot, two spot.."
nemwan," Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling!"
,
rebecca,"  So, you want to donate this 
              to charity?"
george," Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off."
rebecca, What's the value of the book?
george," Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney."
rebecca,  It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.
george, Oh.
rebecca,"  Oh, wait a second.  
              This book has been in the bathroom."
george,"  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's 
              rediculous."
rebecca," It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. 
              Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough 
              that we have some nut out"
george,"  Alright, I, I'll just 
              take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?"
rebecca," Yeah, and here it is You get your toilet book out of 
              here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!"
george, I could take it in merchandise..
rebecca,  Here I come..
,
elaine," So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?"
cashier, Yeah.
elaine, Great.
jerry,"  So, the worst is over?"
elaine," Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm 
              the office hero."
jerry," Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real 
              ones."
elaien," Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho."
elaine,  See ya.
jerry,"  I'd like to speak with the manager, please."
,
newman," Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!"
kramer,"  Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. "
newman," Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is."
kramer,  Oh..
newman,  Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
kramer, Woah! Wait!
newman, Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
zach,"  Well, this is the first day of the rest of my 
              life!"
newman, Waaaaahhhh!
,
jerry, George? What are you doin' here?
george, I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
jerry,  It certainly has.
george," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That 
              way, everything is even."
jerry,"  You defile one book, steal 
              another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?"
george, I'm goin' in!
manager, Did you want to speak with the manager?
jerry, Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
manager," Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy 
              is we prosecute all shoplifters."
jerry,"  Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All 
              old people steal."
manager," That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. 
              Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft 
              lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone."
jerry, So it could be anyone?
manager, I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
jerry, That guy!  Swarm! Swarm!
george, No! Jerry!
walter, Thanks.
elaine," Uh, no, thanks."
elaine," You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. 
              Every day is somebody's special day."
elaine, It's his birthday and it's his last day?
other-walter," Hey, what's going on here?"
all, Surprise! 
other-walter, Oh guys.
other-walter," Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece."
elaine," All right, pile it on."
jerry, What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
elaine," It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work 
              in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?"
jerry, Why aren't you there now?
elaine," I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. 
              By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her."
jerry," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee 
              messiness."
elaine," Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic 
              books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning.."
jerry," Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me 
              and George to Mario's Pizza?"
elaine, Your old high school hangout? Why?
jerry, They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
kramer," Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution 
              tape. Look at that. "
kramer," Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here."
jerry, Where did you get this?
kramer," Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug."
jerry," You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any 
              of these people?"
kramer, They want to know why they never see you.
kramer, I'm gonna eat that later.
jerry, So they just gave you this?
kramer," Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room 
              for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this 
              new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya."
elaine," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?"
kramer," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running 
              around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off."
jerry, How come I haven't read about this?
kramer," Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal 
              dissension about the name."
elaine, Really? What're the other titles?
kramer," Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad."
jerry, Son of dad?
kramer, Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
george, Mario's Pizza.
george," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?"
mario, No.
jerry, We used to come in every day.
mario, So where ya been? We're tanking here.
george, We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
mario," Oh, thanks. That'll save us."
jerry," All right, make it the large sodas."
george," Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this 
              game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life."
jerry," Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game."
george, Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
boy, Thanks a lot.
george," Ah, beat it, punk."
jerry," Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis 
              Costanza. That's not you, is it?"
george," Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one 
              has beaten me in like 10 years."
jerry, I remember that night.
george," The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just 
              the right amount of grease on the joy stick..."
mario, Here's your pizza pea brains.
jerry, I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
george, Yeah.
elaine, What is this?
elaine," Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating 
              a sick day?"
elaine," What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life 
              with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. 
              Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow 
              metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!"
becky, Can we still it eat?
jerry," I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--"
lisi, End under water?
jerry," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--"
lisi, So much more violent.
jerry, Not as long.
lisi," Well, I should probably--"
jerry, Get going.
lisi, Yeah.
jerry," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--"
lisi, Eight tomorrow?
jerry," Actually, that's--"
lisi, What you were thinking.
jerry, Right.
george," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--"
jerry, Sure.  How about this one?
george," Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. 
              Now the torch will burn forever."
jerry," Fabulous. See, now you're really do something."
george," So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and 
              help me pick up the Frogger?"
jerry," Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you 
              move it?"
george, What?
jerry," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased."
george," You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd 
              think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with 
              that score!"
kramer," Well, more bad news Jerry."
kramer," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper 
              in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you."
kramer, Not as many as there used to be.
george," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that 
              I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. 
              H-hello?"
kramer," You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician 
              like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can 
              do this."
jerry, Another friend?
kramer," Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't 
              even get along."
george," Well, is he good, Kramer?"
kramer," Oh, he's the best...and the worst."
george," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If 
              I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
kramer," Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete."
george, Slippery Pete?
kramer," Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's 
              one of the things that we argue about."
george," All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must 
              live on!"
jerry, Come on.
kramer, Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
jerry, Hello?
intercut,
elaine, So how's it going with my friend?
jerry, She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
jerry, What is that?
elaine," Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't 
              realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush."
jerry, So join in.
elaine," I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's 
              fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there."
jerry, All right.
jerry," Hey, wh-what--"
kramer, Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
elaine, Anybody here? Peterboy?
elaine," Ooh, it's a cake walk."
peterman," Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness."
elaine," Mr. Peterman, um--"
peterman," We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has 
              a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. 
              Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?"
elaine," No, sir, I can't."
peterman," Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest 
              acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII 
              to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000."
jerry," Well Lisi, that was another-"
lisi, Lovely evening.
jerry, Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
lisi, Go for a hansom cab ride?
jerry, Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
lisi," 84th street, right off Riverside Park."
jerry, Riverside Park.
lisi, I thought we were going--
jerry, Back to my place. That's right.
george, So you slept with her?
jerry," She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the 
              Lopper, So I let her stay over."
george, And you automatically sleep with her?
jerry," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--"
george, Finished your thought.
elaine, Guess what I ate.
george, An ostrich burger.
elaine," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke 
              Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
jerry, How'd it taste?
elaine, A little stale.
jerry, Yeah.
george," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more 
              of it."
elaine," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise 
              for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country."
jerry," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship 
              weekend place."
ealine, What is going on with you two?
jerry," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her 
              the wrong message."
george, What's that?
elaine, 400 sugar fix.
jerry," Well, I'm calling this off right now. "
elaine," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage."
jerry," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper 
              is."
elaine," Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make 
              a clean break."
elaine, Just a little off the side...
elaine," Well, no point in wasting $1,200."
george," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what 
              you do."
george," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue 
              electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver."
shlomo, I don't know If I'm the best.
george, Oh...you're very good.
shlomo," Let's say ""good."""
george," Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the 
              loading zone."
kramer, Lock and load.
kramer," All right, all right, come on, now."
kramer," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her."
kramer, You weren't even married yet.
george," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened 
              in the past is past."
george," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza."
shlomo, So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
george, What do you mean?
george, No. I--I paid for it.
kramer, Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
george, We're not stealing it.
shlomo, I definitely thought we're stealing it.
george," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?"
george," Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. 
              This is the front door, and this is the outlet."
george, The outlet?
george, That's where the electricity comes out.
shlomo, Which one's the bathroom?
george," Uh, here."
shlomo, They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
george, The Frogger is here.
kramer," George, I thought that was the door."
shlomo, I thought the bathroom was here.
george, All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
elaine,I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
elaine," Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around 
              for a while? Something prewar would be just great."
kramer," Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?"
elaine," Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake 
              that looks like this."
kramer," Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake."
elaine, Do any of these look close?
kramer," No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. 
              Yeah."
elaine, Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
kramer," Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, 
              they got their own case at the end of the aisle."
jerry," Hi, Lisi."
lisi," Hi, honey. Is that a bat? "
jerry," Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth 
              something."
lisi," So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?"
jerry," Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk."
montage,
jerry," Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. 
              I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?"
lisi, Then may I say something... without being interrupted?
jerry," Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what 
              I set out to do."
lisi, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...
lisi, Are you afraid to kiss me in public?
jerry, Have we even been in public?
lisi," So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go 
              ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know."
jerry, You are not dumb. Don't say that..
jerry, These beans are pretty good.
lisi, 20 minutes.
jerry," Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!"
jerry, Nice to meet ya!
lisi," Boy, did your mother do a number on you."
lisi, Fine. So it's over.
jerry," Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?"
lisi, 930.
jerry, We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
lisi," Good-bye, Jerry."
jerry," Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little 
              more time. See how it looks in the light of day."
lisi, Out!
jerry, Lopper.
jerry," Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, 
              you were right. I'll do anything!"
george," Jerry, you came for the big moment."
jerry, No. I'm waiting for...
george," Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery 
              Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will 
              be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone."
jerry, Oh. Sounds great.
george," Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play."
jerry," Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend."
george, Where?
lisi," Look what I found. I got one for you, too."
jerry," Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car 
              so I don't toss it in that dumpster?"
lisi," Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes."
jerry," A long, long weekend."
george, I hear thee.
peterman," Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, 
              Irwin Lubeck."
elaine," Oh, hello."
lubeck, Charmed.
peterman," All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be 
              launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing 
              and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family."
elaine, I guess I'll just--
peterman," Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost 
              appraiser of vintage pastry."
peterman," All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?"
lubeck, I'd say about 219.
peterman," Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. 
              You just made me a profit of $190,000."
lubeck," No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's."
peterman, Do they have a castle at Windsor?
lubeck, No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.
peterman," Oh, good lord."
lubeck," You all right, Peterman? You look ill."
george, What are you guys doing?
shlomo, Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
george, You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
george, Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
kramer," George, they closed up."
george, I need an outlet!
george, Holes! I need holes!
kramer, The pharmacy's still open.
george," All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk 
              the pharmacist."
kramer, Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
jerry," Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across."
george," Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of 
              something. I can do this."
jerry, By yourself?
george," Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life."
shlomo, He looks like a Frog.
jerry, Game over.
elaine," Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?"
peterman," Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I 
              was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the 
              books--The Entenmann's shim-sham."
ealine, Ohh...
peterman," Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system 
              that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it 
              also caught this."
ealine," Mr. Peterman, I, uh..."
peterman," Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with 
              you?"
elaine, Um...as far as I know.
peterman," Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after 
              six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?"
elaine," Uh, I guess I hadn't--"
peterman," Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go 
              through is punishment enough. Dismissed."
george, What happened to your voice?
jerry," I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open 
              for a rodeo."
george," Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can 
              go with George Costanza."
jerry, Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
george," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's 
              got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
jerry, You mean like...Liza!
george, But I was thinking...T-bone.
jerry," But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?"
george, There's no G-bone.
jerry, There's a g-spot.
george, That's a myth.
jerry," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
elaine, Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
jerry, They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
elaine," Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama 
              or--"
jerry," Oh, I had that comin' to me. "
elaine," You know, Kenny Rogers has a-"
jerry, You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
elaine, Where did you get her?
jerry, I hired her from a service!
maid, All done.
jerry, Thank you. Nice job.
maid, Is this mine?
jerry, Yeah.
jerry, What?
elaine," Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?"
jerry, Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
elaine, Oh.
jerry," She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or 
              a...news woman."
elaine, Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
kramer," Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's 
              movin' away."
jerry, You have a girlfriend?
kramer," Jerry, where have you been?"
jerry, At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
kramer, Downtown.
elaine, Downtown New York?
kramer," Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance 
              relationships."
jerry, It's like 10 minutes by subway.
kramer, I don't know.
kramer," Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different 
              world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's 
              a 646."
elaine, What? What is that?
jerry," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all 
              the new numbers are 646."
elaine, I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
kramer," Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later 
              and pick up a fax."
elaine, At work?
kramer, No. At your apartment.
elaine, I don't have a fax machine.
jerry, Here we go. 
kramer," Well, now what are we gonna do?  See? This is 
              why you should get a fax and a Xerox."
jerry, And a dead bolt.
elaine, Then maybe you have a fax machine.
kramer, You just blew my mind.
kruger, Let's order lunch.
kruger," Mary, I will have a chef's salad."
george, T-bone steak.
kruger, For lunch?
george," Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In 
              fact, you might as well call me--"
watkins," That sounds good. I'll have one, too."
kruger," Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?"
watkins, I love 'em.
kruger," Well, then we should call you T-bone."
george," Uh, no. No, we shouldn't."
kruger, T-bone!
elaine, Hello?
elaine, What?
machine, You have 57 messages. Message one...
machine, Message two...
machine, Message three...
george," Hey, it's George. Listen, I-"
machine, Message four...
ealine, Hello?
elaine, Aah!
jerry," Well Cindy, the place looks great."
cindy," Thanks Jerry, gotta run."
jerry," Ok, I'll see ya."
cindy," Hi, Elaine."
elaine," All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is 
              a wise decision."
jerry," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation 
              so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
elaine," You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep 
              with you."
jerry, No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
elaine, What? A health plan?
jerry," I was going to say, ""Being a good host."""
elaine, Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
jerry," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and 
              we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some 
              what sophisticated."
elaine, So you consider this a relationship?
jerry," Yes, I do. "
elaine, Oh. Have you been out?
jerry," Yes, we have."
elaine, Where did you go?
jerry, The store.
elaine, Mm! To get what?
jerry, Stuff.
elaine, Cleaning supplies?
jerry, And gum.
elaine," Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' 
              the maid and then chewin' some gum."
jerry, She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
kramer," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab 
              and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already."
elaine," Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house 
              every 30 seconds?"
kramer," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're 
              Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the 
              menus from some restaurants."
elaine, Which ones?
kramer," Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package."
elaine, So this is never gonna stop?
kramer," Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should 
              I pick those up later?"
elaine, You can pick 'em up right now.
kramer, Ah!
elaine, Ahem. 646? What is this?
elaine, I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
elaine," No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's 
              just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed."
elaine," You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
jerry," Kramer, you're still on the phone?"
kramer," Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you 
              know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
jerry, Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
jerry, Madeline stays here.
jerry," Hey, T-bone!"
george, No. No T-bone.
jerry, No T-bone?
jerry, No! There's no T-bone!
kramer," Well, why no T-bone?!"
jerry, Why no T-bone?
george, 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
kramer," Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?"
kramer," Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. 
              You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah."
george, Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
george, You're sleepin' with the maid?
jerry, Yes. 
george, I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
jerry, No.
man," You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give 
              out her number."
elaine," No, I'm not. Here you go."
man, 646?
elaine, It's a new area code.
man, What area? New Jersey?
elaine," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. 
              They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle 
              number. It's the same."
man, Do I have to dial a one first?
man, I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
elaine," Yeah? Well, so am I!"
george," Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
watkins, It's T-bone.
george, The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
watkins, Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
george," What? Now, you listen to me!"
kruger," Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' 
              up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of 
              that monkey that could read sign language?"
watkins," All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying."
george," Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From 
              now on, I will be known as-"
kruger, Koko the monkey.
george, What?
man, Thank you both for being here.
ealine," Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen 
              to Mrs. Krantz?"
man, She passed. 
elaine," Oh, I'm so sorry."
man, Thank you.
elaine," A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone 
              number?"
cindy," I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is."
kramer," Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?"
jerry, Yeah. It's in your closet.
kramer," No, no, no. I looked."
jerry, They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
kramer," Thanks, buddy."
jerry, Where you goin'?
kramer," Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline 
              for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What 
              happened to Cindy?"
jerry," Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it."
kramer, Oh.
cindy," Hi, Kramer."
cindy," Thanks, Jerry. Bye."
kramer," Well, what's the matter?"
jerry, What did I just pay for?
kramer, Uh-oh. You're a john.
jerry, Koko?
george, Koko.
jerry," Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is."
george," Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?"
jerry," Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' 
              for sex."
george," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. 
              First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
jerry," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like 
              I'm seein' a prostitute."
george, How much you pay this maid?
jerry, 40.
george," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and 
              I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't 
              know what that was."
jerry, I don't know what this is.
kramer," Hey, hey, hey. Look at that."
jerry, Ooh.
kramer," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. 
              Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry."
george," I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look 
              straight forward."
kramer," Well, now I can't see Jerry."
jerry, I look about the same.
george, What?
jerry, I was talking to him.
kramer, What?
jerry, Never mind.
kramer, Come on. What'd he say?
george, Never mind.
kramer," Jerry, come on. What'd you say?"
jerry, What?
kramer, Come on. Where'd you go?
jerry, Go back.
kramer, Eh! Come on. What did you say?
jerry," I said, never mind."
kramer," Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh."
jerry, I hate the counter.
elaine, Hey.
jerry, Hey.
elaine, I hate the counter.
kramer, Who's that?
jerry," Oh, she didn't mind?"
elaine, No. She died.
jerry," Hey, that's great."
george, What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
jerry, Elaine got a new number because she died.
kramer, Newman died?
elaine, What did he say?
jerry, Some new kind of pie.
george, I'll try a piece.
kramer," All right, who's down there?"
jerry," Hey, there's a booth."
kramer," Hey, Elaine."
elaine," Oh, hi."
kramer, Did you hear about Newman?
elaine, What?
george, Hey. 
jerry, So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
george," Oh, yeah."
jerry, Double zero?
george," It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah."" "
cindy," Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid 
              service is named Coco."
george, Really? Coco?
cindy, Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
george," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, 
              they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would 
              never allow 2 Kokos."
jerry, Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
george, Say good-bye to Koko.
jerry," Good-bye, Koko."
kramer," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. 
              The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't 
              realize it, but I'm a needy person."
jerry," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you."
kramer," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? 
              All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen 
              for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never 
              be like you! "
cindy, What was that?
jerry, I didn't hear anything.
cindy," All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?"
jerry," Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your 
              outfit."
cindy, No. My money.
jerry, For what?
cindy, For my maid services. You booked me for today.
jerry, But you didn't really do any work.
cindy, I made the bed.
jerry, But you took a nap in it.
cindy, So?
jerry, I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
cindy, No. That was the maid.
jerry," Well, who took the nap?"
cindy, The girlfriend.
jerry, $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
cindy," So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind 
              of a prostitute?"
jerry," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated."
cindy," You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or 
              your maid."
jerry, So is this a breakup/quitting?
cindy, Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
jerry," Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!"
elaine, Yes! 212.
elaine," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
elaine, All right! I am back in the game.
elaine, Hello?
boy, Gammy!
elaine," No. You got the wrong number, kid."
boy," Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?"
elaine, Oh...nuts. 
boy, Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
elaine, No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
jerry, So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
elaine, Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
jerry, Miss.
elaine," He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be 
              to have a real family."
jerry, I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
elaine, Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
jerry, Elaine...
intercut,
jerry, Hello?
kramer," Hey, buddy, don't say no!"
jerry, I accept.
kramer," I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta 
              move, or it's over."""
jerry," Well, what happened?"
kramer," I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, 
              I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. 
              I don't recognize anybody. I miss home,"
jerry, What's around you?
kramer, I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
jerry, Is it Famous Ray's?
kramer, No. It's Original Ray's.
jerry, Famous Original Ray's?
kramer," It's just Original, Jerry!"
jerry," Well, what street are you on?"
kramer," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect 
              with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
jerry," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive 
              no matter what occurs, I will find you!"
kramer, Aah!
man, You Steinfeld?
jerry, Yeah.
man," My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I 
              sent one of my girls over to your place."
jerry, Cindy.
man," She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay. 
            "
jerry," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to 
              do."
man," Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, 
              aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--"
jerry," Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here."
man, You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
jerry, What?
man," Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get 
              my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her. "
jerry," I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 
            "
man," Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent 
              contractor. Tax purposes."
elaine," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because 
              sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been 
              out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. 
              Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? 
               All right, here we go.  Gammy doesn't feel so 
              good. I think"
bobby, 9-1-1.
jerry," Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy."
cindy, What do you want?
jerry, Here. I got your money.
cindy, I don't want any money from you.
jerry, Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
police," Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the 
              car, sickie?"
jerry," Well, this is all very sophisticated."
fireman," All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it! "
elaine, Aah!
maxwell," Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?"
kramer," Uh, no."
maxwell, You know where you're going?
kramer," Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I 
              don't know where he is."
maxwell, Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
kramer," Uh, no."
maxwell, You wanna make some?
kramer, Ok.
maxwell, Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
kramer," Yeah, yeah."
maxwell, Why don't you get in the car?
kramer, Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
kruger," Hey, Koko, Who's this?"
george," This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir."
kruger," So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, 
              to hire people?"
george, Yes?
kruger," Ok, good enough for me, Koko."
kruger," Ahem. Now, what's your name?"
coco, My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.
george, Coco?
kruger," We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being 
              George."
george," Well, it was a hell of a ride."
kruger," All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the 
              front. How do we get it off?"
coco," When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to 
              take a wet rag and in a circ--"
george," Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about 
              your Gammy."
coco, What did you say about my Gammy?
george, Forget Gammy.
kruger, Who's Gammy?
george, There's no Gammy.
kruger, Maybe there should be a Gammy.
george," Oh, no."
kruger, George.
george, Gammy's gettin' upset!
george," Man, I'm starving."
elaine, How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
george, Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
jerry," Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with 
              the ball and the rubber band."
kramer," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of 
              those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before 
              that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. "
jerry," I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of 
              the game."
elaine," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting 
              shellacked."
george, Those nachos are killing me.
elaine, I thought you were hungry.
george, It's complicated.
kramer," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit."
jerry, Keep your shirt on. I got it.
elaine, Watch out for that maroon Golf.
kramer," Oh, boy."
jerry, Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
kramer," I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- 
              now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! 
              Jerry! Go--ahh..."
jerry," Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He 
              accelerated."
kramer," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your 
              window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass."
elaine," Oh, no, I couldn't do that."
kramer," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger."
elaine," Oh, all right."
kramer, Yeah.
george, So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
elaine," Oh, yeah. What's that called?"
george, Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
jerry, How was it?
george, I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
jerry," Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg 
              flights that made it."
george," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning 
              debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles 
              over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!"""
jerry, Heh.
george, The place went nuts.
jerry," Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled 
              that out at the actual disaster."
george, Yeah.
kramer, Why are we slowing down?
jerry, What is that music?
george, What's with all these flags?
jerry," Oh, no."
elaine," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let 
              anyone through."
kramer, All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
kramer," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think 
              every Puerto Rican in the world is out here."
kramer, Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
radio, And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.
jerry," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. "
george," I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have 
              calmed down the nachos."
elaine," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 
              60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down."
jerry," I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. 
              It makes me anxious."
kramer," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can 
              get out over there."
jerry," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how 
              am I gonna get all the way over there?"
george, Just inch over. You worm your way.
elaine," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up."
kramer," You know, you should make yourself throw up."
elaine, Huh?
kramer, You know you're going to.
jerry," All right, I'm worming."
kramer," Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? 
              None other than Miss Chita Rivera."
jerry, They're not letting me in.
george, My hand is out.
jerry," Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have 
              to see a human face."
elaine, You sure you want his face?
kramer," No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso."
george, This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
jerry, The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
george, Look at me! I am man! I am you!
george," All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep."
kramer, Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
jerry, One more lane to go.
george, All right! We're here!
lamar," Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab."
jerry, Maroon Golf.
lamar," Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew."
jerry, Could you move your car back a little?
lamar, Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
elaine," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am 
              going somewhere else."
jerry, You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
elaine," I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya 
              con dios."
kramer," Con dios? Well, that's rude."
jerry, Can you believe her?
george, Yeah. I'll see you later.
jerry, Where are you going?
george, The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
jerry," You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid 
              line?"
george," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do."
jerry, That's not what I do.
george, Isn't it?
jerry," Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is."
kramer," You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that 
              big in a while."
elaine," Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped 
              inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? "
elaine, Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
elaine," Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here. "
elaine," Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!"
elaine," That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. 
              Bye again."
elaine, Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
george," Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before."
george," Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?"
george," Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of 
              my own I wanted to try."
george," It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave 
              me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed 
              with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so..."
jerry," I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we 
              could get out of here."
lamar," This traffic's a killer, ain't it?"
kramer," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave 
              the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number 
              off the engine block, and we walk away."
jerry, Walk away?
kramer," You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, 
              and then you get another one free."
jerry, Isn't there a deductible?
kramer," All right, what is your deductible?"
jerry, I don't know.
kramer," Yes, because they've already deducted it."
jerry, From what?
kramer," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you 
              pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car."
jerry, We're not leaving the car!
kramer," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance 
              company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf."
jerry, Absolutely not. He sped up.
radio," Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in 
              the gap, that's a base hit."
jerry, I'm ready to talk.
george, That's gotta hurt!
george, It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
george," Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow 
              laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!"
kramer," Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you 
              cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave."
jerry, What's that?
kramer," You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm 
              sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand 
              it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift."
jerry, Ok!
lamar, Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
kramer," Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can 
              get out now."
george," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here."
jerry, What's that on your forehead?
george, It's probably chocolate.
jerry," Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?"
kramer," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!"
george," All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!"
jerry," See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an 
              ""I'm not sorry"" wave."
lamar, What was that?
jerry," I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, 
              jackass! "
jerry, Elaine?!
elaine, Jerry?!
lamar, Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
jerry," So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the 
              same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can 
              everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?"
jerry, Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
elaine," Uh, well, uh, here--here is good."
elaine," Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't 
              talk to me about hardship."
elaine," Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?"
jerry," Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! 
              We were almost out!"
lamar," So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's 
              real good."
elaine," I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, 
              but not anymore."
jerry," Elaine, he doesn't need-"
lamar, Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
jerry, 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
kramer, Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
george, Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
elaine," All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's 
              a sniper lookin' to pop ya."
george," This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. 
              What if it hits my eye?"
jerry, I don't know.
george," I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous."
kramer," You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the 
              pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. 
              Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom."
jerry," Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes."
george," Oh, my god. "
jerry," Hey, there's the soda guy."
lamar," Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!"
elaine," Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!"
elaine," Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through 
              here."
elaine," Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! 
              They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, 
              and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!"
priest, None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.
elaine, All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
elaine, Get in there!
kramer," Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment."
kramer, Ok.
kramer, Oh. Delicious to meet you.
kramer," Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm 
              a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. 
              And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with 
              my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. 
               Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?"
kramer," Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell 
              men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall 
              grotto?"
kramer, How about a bathroom?
kramer," Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?"
kramer," Oh, thank you."
elaine," Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real 
              soon."
elaine," Well, I, for one, really respect that."
elaine," Come on, father, you can make it."
priest," No, I can't. I've got a bad hip. Go on without me."
elaine, No! I won't!
priest, Leave me! you must.
elaine, All right. Take it easy.
elaine," All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy."
priest, I heard that!
lamar," You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab 
              convertible. Still haven't."
jerry," What seems to be the problem, officer?"
george," They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?"
jerry, At me?
george, No.
jerry, Oh. It's back.
george," Bring it on, baby "
jerry, What if it gets in the side?
george, The side?
jerry," Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your 
              cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more 
              intense, until finally-"
george, All right!
jerry, Oh. It's in your eye now.
kramer," Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! 
              The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!"
jerry," Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!"
kramer," Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game."
jerry, You were watchin'? Where?
jerry," Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?! "
jerry," Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues 
              me. Why is it called the TV room?"
jerry, Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
jerry, Not Pennypacker!
jerry," I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding 
              war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!"
george," Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! 
              Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak 
              up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter."
elaine, We should be able to get across right through here! 
elaine," Oh, no! I thought--"
elaine, Get a hold of yourself!
elaine, Sorry. Somebody...help us!
man, !Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
elaine, We're down here! Help!
man, There's people down there! Hold on!
elaine, Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
elaine, Help us up so we can cross the street?
elaine, But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
elaine," Oh, god! Let us out!"
george, That wasn't a laser pen.
george," Oh, that's funny "
kramer," Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling 
              like this only happens once a year. "
kramer," Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
kramer," See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?"
kramer, Ooh! !Dios mio!
man, Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
bob, Who! Who is burning the flag?!
kramer," Oh, no."
bob, Him?!
cedric, That's not very nice.
kramer, It was an accident.
bob," Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this 
              is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what 
              day this is!"
cedric, Because it's Puerto Rican day.
bob," Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do 
              you think of that?"
kramer," Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!"
george," Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna 
              go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably 
              one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?"
jerry," Oh, hello..."
george, Art.
jerry," Mr. Vandelay, of course."
kramer," Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure 
              that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello."
kramer," Uh, Varnsen."
jerry, Pennypacker.
kramer, Vandelay.
george, Pennypacker. Varnsen.
jerry," Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
              and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?"
kramer, The factory?
jerry, The Saab factory?
kramer," Jerry, that's in Sweden."
jerry, My car!
kramer," Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
george," Jerry, the Mets lost."
jerry, I love a parade!
george, How do you suppose they did that?
kramer," Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, 
              shall we go home?"
jerry," Well, what about my car?"
kramer," Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now."
jerry," Hey, there's Elaine."
elaine, Hey.
jerry," Well, you look, uh...relaxed."
elaine," Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind."
lamar," Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha 
              ha ha! See ya around!"
jerry," Well, at least he didn't-"
lamar, Jackass!
jerry, Somebody remember where we parked.
kramer, This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
jerry," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
george," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
jerry, I know what you mean.
george, Do ya?
jerry, It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
george, Same thing!
jerry," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
george, Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
woman, What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
man, It's up to you.
woman, You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
jerry, So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
george, Nah - what for?
jerry, To see a movie.
george, I've been to the movies.
jerry, Not this movie.
george," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
jerry, Did you shower today?
george, Yeah.
jerry, That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
george," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
jerry," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
george," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
woman," All right, we're done. You can have it now."
george," Oh, very gracious."
man, Nice day
george, Yeah.
jerry, What is that?
kramer, Hey! JoJo!
jerry," Ey, ey!"
elaine," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
kramer," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
jerry, Nothing.
kramer," Come on, let's go to the beach."
george, What are you crazy?
kramer, What? It's a beautiful day.
jerry, Have a good time.
kramer," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
jerry, You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
kramer," Yeah, there's something in the air."
elaine," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
jerry, Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
elaine, What? No good?
jerry, Faux pas.
elaine, Faux pas?
george, Big hefty stinking faux pas.
elaine, Why?
jerry," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
george, On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
jerry, It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
george, It's dismissive.
jerry, It's pompous.
george, Why don't you think before you do something?
elaine, Here's a thought - Bye bye.
george, Too much?
george," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
jerry, Hey - hey - hey!
george, What?
jerry," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
george, You're so uptight.
jerry," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
jerry," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
george, Who's he?
jerry," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
george," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
jerry, Right.
george," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
jerry, Yeah!
george, When? 
jerry," Today, like right now."
george," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
jerry," ""Jerry""!"
george," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
jerry," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
george," ""Jerry""!"
jerry," ""Jerry""!"
george, Can I go like this?
jerry, Sure!
george, No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
jerry, Forget the sports jacket.
george, I won't feel like a writer.
jerry, You're not a writer.
george, Right!
george, Water. Need some water! Water here!
jerry," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
george," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
jerry, Don't blow this.
george, I will not blow this.
jerry," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
george," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
jerry, He might not want nothing.
george," Something, nothing, I could care less."
jerry, He might want a show about anything and everything.
george," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
jerry, All right.
receptionist, Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you 
george, Magic time.
jerry, What?
receptionist, Mr. Kimbrough.
stu," Hey, Jerry, good to see you."
george," Hey, hey, hey!"
stu, How you been?
jerry," Good, good. You remember George."
stu," George, good to see you."
george, Hello Stu.
stu, You remember Jay Crespi.
george," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
stu, This is James Kimbrough.
kimbrough," Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in."
george, Kimbrough.
jerry, Don't spell.
george, K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
kimbrough, That's right.
george, It's a talent I have.
kimbrough," Why don't we sit down, glad you're here."
george," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
jerry," Shut up, George."
kimbrough, Can I get you anything?
george, What do we have in the fruit department?
jerry, Oy.
stu , Pineapple.
george," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
kimbrough," Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I
        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old."
george," Been there, done that."
kimbrough," Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have
        people talking at the water coolers."
george, Water coolers?
crespi, We call it a water-cooler show.
jerry," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
george," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
jerry," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
george," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
jerry, But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
kimbrough," Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he
        developed five years ago."
stu, I have always loved it.
kimbrough," He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to
        tell you - I flipped out."
crespi, He totally flipped out.
kimbrough," What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off
        on Wednesday night, build up an"
jerry, He's a little off the wall.
crespi, Oh yeah.
stu, Kramer.
kimbrough, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
jerry, Definitely.
george," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
kimbrough," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?"
george, Or we could get them together. Woo!
george, Yeah!
jerry, Yeah!
elaine," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
jerry," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
elaine," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
jerry, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
elaine," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
jerry," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        California!"
elaine, That's the emergency?
jerry, Did you hear what I said?
elaine, I was on the other line talking to Jill.
jerry," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
elaine, You said it was an emergency.
jerry," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
helen," Congratulations, they're doing the show."
morty," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.
        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the
        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six."
helen, She's not six-six.
morty," Jerry, you ever watch that?"
jerry," Yeah, it's pretty good."
estelle, They picked up the show?
george, I'm moving to California.
frank," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you."
estelle, The NBC guy liked it?
george, Of course he liked it.
estelle, He told you he liked it?
george, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
estelle," Well, what are you doing?"
george, I'm writing.
estelle, You know how to write?
frank," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good."
estelle, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
george, Ma?!
estelle," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get
        all the ideas?"
frank, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
george, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
estelle," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty
        stupid to me."
jerry," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
kramer, Oh hey!
jerry, Hey - how was the beach?
kramer," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
jerry, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
kramer," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
jerry," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
kramer, You're moving to California?
jerry," Yeah, only for a while."
kramer," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
jerry," No, I'll be back."
kramer," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
jerry," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
kramer, Fling!
elaine, So we can go anywhere we want?
jerry, Anywhere.
elaine, Why are they doing this?
jerry," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
elaine, This is all very exciting.
george, So? Where are we going?
kramer, I say Japan.
elaine, Why Japan?
kramer," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
elaine, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
jerry," Russia, it's so bleak."
elaine, It's not bleak - it's springtime.
jerry, It's still bleak.
elaine, You can't be bleak in spring.
jerry, You can be bleak in spring.
george," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
elaine, What about Switzerland?
kramer," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
george, It's a bit hilly - no?
elaine, You're not going to do any walking.
george, What if I want to walk around a little?
elaine, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
george, What if I'm at the bottom?
elaine," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
jerry," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
elaine, I'll go to Paris.
george, Me too.
kramer, Oh yeah - oui oui.
jerry," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
group, Yeah!
elaine," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
jerry," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
elaine," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
jerry," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
elaine," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
newman," Hello, Jerry."
jerry," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
newman," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
jerry," Yeah, that's right."
newman," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
jerry, Really.
newman," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
jerry, That's a shame.
newman, Take me! Take me!
jerry," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
newman," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
captain," Ah, Jerry?"
jerry, Yeah.
captain," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?"
jerry, All set. We'll just grab the bags.
captain, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
jerry, Just keeps on getting better and better.
jerry, Not bad.
elaine, Wow!
kramer, The only way to fly.
george, This is it?
george," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."
jerry, You're complaining about a private jet?
george, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
jerry, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
george," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
elaine, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
george," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a
        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough."
jerry, You're not writing any letters!
elaine, Will you turn around?
george, Why?
elaine, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
george, It's effeminate to sit like this? 
elaine," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
george, How is this effeminate?
elaine, I don't know - it just is.
george," Kramer, what are you doing?"
jerry, Still got water in your ear?
kramer, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
george, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
kramer," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
george," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
george, Kramer!
captain," Hey, get the hell out of here!"
elaine, What is that?
george, Oh my God!
elaine, What is that noise? What is that noise?
jerry," Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
kramer, I lost my balance.
elaine, Oh my God!
elaine, What's going on?
jerry, Kramer!
kramer, It was an accident.
george, I told you to stop with the hopping.
elaine," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
george, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
jerry, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
kramer, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
george, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
jerry, Yeah.
george, There's something I have to tell you.
jerry, What? What is it?
george, I cheated in the contest.
elaine, What?
jerry, What?
george, The contest - I cheated.
jerry, Why?
george, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
jerry, Great - I won.
elaine," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
jerry," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
elaine, No no - me first.
jerry, Alright.
elaine," Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
george, Hey - What's going on?
kramer, We're straightening out!
elaine, We're straightening out?
jerry, We're straightening out!
george, We're straightening out!
group, Yeah!
captain," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything
        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems."
jerry, Where are we?
captain," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself
        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."
jerry, Okay.
elaine, Okay.
jerry, We'll see you later.
elaine," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get
        back on this plane?"
jerry," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
george," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private
        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane."
elaine," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
george," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
jerry," Alright, I'll feel him out."
george," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
stranger, Nice day.
jerry, Another one?
robber," Alright fatso, out of the car."
kramer, I want to capture this.
robber, Come on! Gimme your wallet.
victim, Don't shoot.
jerry," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
elaine," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?
        They can't really chase ya!"
george, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
robber," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on."
jerry," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
victim," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at
        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!"
jerry," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
kramer," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
elaine, Forget it.
jerry," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat
        in Sticksville."
officer," All right, hold it right there."
kramer, What?
officer, You're under arrest.
jerry, Under arrest? What for?
officer, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
elaine," What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
officer," That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger
        as long as it's reasonable todo so.George I never heard of that."
officer, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
elaine, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
george, Why would we want to help somebody?
elaine, I know.
george, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
kramer, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
elaine," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
deputy," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard
        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing
        around."
jerry," Oh, yeah."
elaine," Oh, yeah."
deputy," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country."
george," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and
        get the hell out of here."
deputy," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000
        and as much as five years in prison."
elaine, What?
george," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV
        show."
deputy," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be
        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer."
chiles," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I
        didn't tell you to put the cheese on."
secretary, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
chiles," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good
        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this
        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel
        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham,
        Massachusetts,right away."
prosecutor," So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?"
jerry," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
george," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
jerry, I know what you mean.
george, Do ya?
jerry, It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
george, Same thing!
jerry," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
george, Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
woman, What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
man, It's up to you.
woman, You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
jerry, So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
george, Nah - what for?
jerry, To see a movie.
george, I've been to the movies.
jerry, Not this movie.
george," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
jerry, Did you shower today?
george, Yeah.
jerry, That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
george," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
jerry," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
george," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
woman," All right, we're done. You can have it now."
george," Oh, very gracious."
man, Nice day
george, Yeah.
jerry, What is that?
kramer, Hey! JoJo!
jerry," Ey, ey!"
elaine," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
kramer," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
jerry, Nothing.
kramer," Come on, let's go to the beach."
george, What are you crazy?
kramer, What? It's a beautiful day.
jerry, Have a good time.
kramer," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
jerry, You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
kramer," Yeah, there's something in the air."
elaine," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
jerry, Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
elaine, What? No good?
jerry, Faux pas.
elaine, Faux pas?
george, Big hefty stinking faux pas.
elaine, Why?
jerry," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
george, On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
jerry, It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
george, It's dismissive.
jerry, It's pompous.
george, Why don't you think before you do something?
elaine, Here's a thought - Bye bye.
george, Too much?
george," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
jerry, Hey - hey - hey!
george, What?
jerry," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
george, You're so uptight.
jerry," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
jerry," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
george, Who's he?
jerry," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
george," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
jerry, Right.
george," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
jerry, Yeah!
george, When? 
jerry," Today, like right now."
george," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
jerry," ""Jerry""!"
george," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
jerry," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
george," ""Jerry""!"
jerry," ""Jerry""!"
george, Can I go like this?
jerry, Sure!
george, No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
jerry, Forget the sports jacket.
george, I won't feel like a writer.
jerry, You're not a writer.
george, Right!
george, Water. Need some water! Water here!
jerry," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
george," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
jerry, Don't blow this.
george, I will not blow this.
jerry," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
george," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
jerry, He might not want nothing.
george," Something, nothing, I could care less."
jerry, He might want a show about anything and everything.
george," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
jerry, All right.
receptionist, Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you 
george, Magic time.
jerry, What?
receptionist, Mr. Kimbrough.
stu," Hey, Jerry, good to see you."
george," Hey, hey, hey!"
stu, How you been?
jerry," Good, good. You remember George."
stu," George, good to see you."
george, Hello Stu.
stu, You remember Jay Crespi.
george," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
stu, This is James Kimbrough.
kimbrough," Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in."
george, Kimbrough.
jerry, Don't spell.
george, K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
kimbrough, That's right.
george, It's a talent I have.
kimbrough," Why don't we sit down, glad you're here."
george," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
jerry," Shut up, George."
kimbrough, Can I get you anything?
george, What do we have in the fruit department?
jerry, Oy.
stu , Pineapple.
george," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
kimbrough," Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I
        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old."
george," Been there, done that."
kimbrough," Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have
        people talking at the water coolers."
george, Water coolers?
crespi, We call it a water-cooler show.
jerry," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
george," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
jerry," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
george," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
jerry, But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
kimbrough," Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he
        developed five years ago."
stu, I have always loved it.
kimbrough," He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to
        tell you - I flipped out."
crespi, He totally flipped out.
kimbrough," What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off
        on Wednesday night, build up an"
jerry, He's a little off the wall.
crespi, Oh yeah.
stu, Kramer.
kimbrough, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
jerry, Definitely.
george," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
kimbrough," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?"
george, Or we could get them together. Woo!
george, Yeah!
jerry, Yeah!
elaine," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
jerry," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
elaine," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
jerry, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
elaine," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
jerry," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        California!"
elaine, That's the emergency?
jerry, Did you hear what I said?
elaine, I was on the other line talking to Jill.
jerry," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
elaine, You said it was an emergency.
jerry," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
helen," Congratulations, they're doing the show."
morty," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.
        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the
        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six."
helen, She's not six-six.
morty," Jerry, you ever watch that?"
jerry," Yeah, it's pretty good."
estelle, They picked up the show?
george, I'm moving to California.
frank," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you."
estelle, The NBC guy liked it?
george, Of course he liked it.
estelle, He told you he liked it?
george, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
estelle," Well, what are you doing?"
george, I'm writing.
estelle, You know how to write?
frank," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good."
estelle, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
george, Ma?!
estelle," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get
        all the ideas?"
frank, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
george, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
estelle," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty
        stupid to me."
jerry," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
kramer, Oh hey!
jerry, Hey - how was the beach?
kramer," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
jerry, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
kramer," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
jerry," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
kramer, You're moving to California?
jerry," Yeah, only for a while."
kramer," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
jerry," No, I'll be back."
kramer," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
jerry," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
kramer, Fling!
elaine, So we can go anywhere we want?
jerry, Anywhere.
elaine, Why are they doing this?
jerry," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
elaine, This is all very exciting.
george, So? Where are we going?
kramer, I say Japan.
elaine, Why Japan?
kramer," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
elaine, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
jerry," Russia, it's so bleak."
elaine, It's not bleak - it's springtime.
jerry, It's still bleak.
elaine, You can't be bleak in spring.
jerry, You can be bleak in spring.
george," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
elaine, What about Switzerland?
kramer," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
george, It's a bit hilly - no?
elaine, You're not going to do any walking.
george, What if I want to walk around a little?
elaine, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
george, What if I'm at the bottom?
elaine," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
jerry," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
elaine, I'll go to Paris.
george, Me too.
kramer, Oh yeah - oui oui.
jerry," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
group, Yeah!
elaine," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
jerry," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
elaine," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
jerry," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
elaine," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
newman," Hello, Jerry."
jerry," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
newman," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
jerry," Yeah, that's right."
newman," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
jerry, Really.
newman," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
jerry, That's a shame.
newman, Take me! Take me!
jerry," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
newman," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
captain," Ah, Jerry?"
jerry, Yeah.
captain," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?"
jerry, All set. We'll just grab the bags.
captain, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
jerry, Just keeps on getting better and better.
jerry, Not bad.
elaine, Wow!
kramer, The only way to fly.
george, This is it?
george," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."
jerry, You're complaining about a private jet?
george, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
jerry, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
george," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
elaine, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
george," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a
        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough."
jerry, You're not writing any letters!
elaine, Will you turn around?
george, Why?
elaine, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
george, It's effeminate to sit like this? 
elaine," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
george, How is this effeminate?
elaine, I don't know - it just is.
george," Kramer, what are you doing?"
jerry, Still got water in your ear?
kramer, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
george, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
kramer," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
george," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
george, Kramer!
captain," Hey, get the hell out of here!"
elaine, What is that?
george, Oh my God!
elaine, What is that noise? What is that noise?
jerry," Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
kramer, I lost my balance.
elaine, Oh my God!
elaine, What's going on?
jerry, Kramer!
kramer, It was an accident.
george, I told you to stop with the hopping.
elaine," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
george, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
jerry, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
kramer, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
george, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
jerry, Yeah.
george, There's something I have to tell you.
jerry, What? What is it?
george, I cheated in the contest.
elaine, What?
jerry, What?
george, The contest - I cheated.
jerry, Why?
george, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
jerry, Great - I won.
elaine," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
jerry," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
elaine, No no - me first.
jerry, Alright.
elaine," Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
george, Hey - What's going on?
kramer, We're straightening out!
elaine, We're straightening out?
jerry, We're straightening out!
george, We're straightening out!
group, Yeah!
captain," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything
        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems."
jerry, Where are we?
captain," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself
        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."
jerry, Okay.
elaine, Okay.
jerry, We'll see you later.
elaine," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get
        back on this plane?"
jerry," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
george," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private
        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane."
elaine," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
george," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
jerry," Alright, I'll feel him out."
george," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
stranger, Nice day.
jerry, Another one?
robber," Alright fatso, out of the car."
kramer, I want to capture this.
robber, Come on! Gimme your wallet.
victim, Don't shoot.
jerry," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
elaine," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?
        They can't really chase ya!"
george, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
robber," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on."
jerry," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
victim," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at
        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!"
jerry," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
kramer," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
elaine, Forget it.
jerry," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat
        in Sticksville."
officer," All right, hold it right there."
kramer, What?
officer, You're under arrest.
jerry, Under arrest? What for?
officer, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
elaine," What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
officer," That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger
        as long as it's reasonable todo so.George I never heard of that."
officer, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
elaine, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
george, Why would we want to help somebody?
elaine, I know.
george, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
kramer, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
elaine," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
deputy," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard
        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing
        around."
jerry," Oh, yeah."
elaine," Oh, yeah."
deputy," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country."
george," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and
        get the hell out of here."
deputy," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000
        and as much as five years in prison."
elaine, What?
george," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV
        show."
deputy," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be
        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer."
chiles," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I
        didn't tell you to put the cheese on."
secretary, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
chiles," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good
        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this
        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel
        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham,
        Massachusetts,right away."
prosecutor," So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?"
