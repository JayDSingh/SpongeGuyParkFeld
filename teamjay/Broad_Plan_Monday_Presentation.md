# Introduction

As humans we are well equipped to deduce meaning from words. It usually doesn't take long for us to realize if someone means something in a kind or a not-so-kind way. Or we can usually tell who is friends with who based on how they speak to each other. And with your human intuition you can probably tell through my words that I am 'going somewhere' with this.

The million-dollar question here is can we define exactly how to reach these conclusions? Can we train a computer to --using just the words said-- learn meaning?

# The Project

### Overview
Our project will be an analysis of the language from transcripts of popular TV shows. Namely, we intend to look at SpongeBob, Family Guy, South Park, and Seinfeld. These are intentionally chosen to represent children's, teens', and adult audiences. 

### Metrics
We intend to collect metrics such as:
* Vocabulary size and richness.  (Depth and breadth of vocabulary)
* Word length.
* Word frequency.  
* Profanity frequency.  
* Sentiment analysis.
* Syntax.

### Deliverables
From this we will produce:

###### Analysis Report
We intend to use the metrics to see how the different shows compare. We will make an analysis and intend to publish our finding in UCSB's Daily Nexus 'Labyrinth' section which is a new feature dedicated to data journalism.

###### Speech Generator
With all the data we collect we believe we will be able to generate phrases that a character is likely to say. As humans we can find a way to mimic SpongeBob or Cartman or Seinfeld but it would be pretty cool if a computer could do the same.

###### Character Relations
We will try to define and quantify the web of relationships between different characters in a TV show

###### Change in Writers
People can often tell one writer's style from another. Can a computer?
