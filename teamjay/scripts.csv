"Season Episode Character Dialogue"
"JERRY: You know, why we're here? [he means: here in the ""Comedy 
 club""] To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single 
 most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people 
 talking about ""We should go out""? This is what they're 
 talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. 
 Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' 
 to find us, they don't know where we are. [imitates one of these 
 people ""tryin' to find us""; pretends his hand is a phone] 
 ""Did you ring?, I can't find him."" [imitates other person 
 on phone] ""Where did he go?""  
 ""He didn't tell me where he was going"". He must have gone 
 out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, 
 right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get 
 your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're 
 staring around, whatta you do? You go: ""We gotta be getting 
 back"". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to 
 sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? 
 Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go."
"[Scene: Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a 
 table.]"
"JERRY: Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. 
  The second button literally makes 
 or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, 
 you look like you live with your mother."
"GEORGE: Are you through? "
"JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?"
"GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall 
 considering the buttons."
"JERRY: Oh, you don't recall?"
"GEORGE:  Uh, no, not at 
 this time."
"JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when 
 you knew it. "
"WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld.  Mister 
 Costanza. "
"GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?"
"WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, 
 regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging 
 work. "
"JERRY: Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional 
 waitress."
"WAITRESS: Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you 
 on caffeine. "
"GEORGE: How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?"
"JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in."
"GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
 is coming in?"
"JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
"GEORGE: No, you didn't!"
"JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political 
 science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks 
 in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what..."
"GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry 
 and puts it on the table] what is she like?"
"JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth 
 about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the 
 conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking 
 with you, but, ya know, obviously much better."
"GEORGE:  So, ya know, what, what happened?"
"JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
"GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: This is great!"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
 you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
"JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
 called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
 maybe we'll get together. "
"GEORGE:  Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had 
 to come in""?"
"JERRY: Yeah, but..."
"GEORGE: ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? 
 ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?"
"JERRY: Yeah!"
"GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna 
 see this woman."
"JERRY:  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
"GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 
 "
"JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!"
"GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you 
 wanna know why she called you?"
"JERRY: Yes!"
"GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
 a B-plan of contingency!"
"JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
"GEORGE:  passes the table; George stops her 
 and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a 
 woman, right?"
"CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?"
"GEORGE: Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical 
 phone call, ya know, from a female point of view."
"JERRY:  Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, 
 how is she gonna know?"
"GEORGE:  Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
 she has to  come 
 to New York on business..."
"JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!  "
"GEORGE: and, and maybe  she'll see me when 
 she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
"CLAIRE: I'd have to say: uuhh, no. [George shows his note-block 
 to Jerry, it says very largely: NO]"
"GEORGE:  So why did she call?"
"CLAIRE: To be polite."
"GEORGE: To be polite, I rest my case."
"JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking 
 about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get 
 my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
"GEORGE: I'm not gonna watch you do laundry."
"JERRY: Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy""."
"GEORGE: Come on, I'm tired."
"CLAIRE:  Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll 
 perk up."
"GEORGE:  Right, 
 I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away 
 with a smile]"
"[Scene: Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring 
 at one of the dryers]"
"GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest 
 moment I've ever experienced. [walks away from the dryer; a man 
 passes George and Jerry]"
"JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's 
 got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first 
 load."
"GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the 
 city, I feel so cramped..."
"JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded."
"GEORGE: What?!"
"JERRY: Laura."
"GEORGE: I can't believe:  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
 THIS!"
"JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
"GEORGE:  'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his 
 fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask 
 you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
"JERRY: No."
"GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? 
 What is that? It's Saturday night!"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: What is that? It's ridiculous!  
 You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call 
 her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers 
 again] Signal!"
"JERRY: Maybe you're right."
"GEORGE: Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right."
"JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's 
 staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
"GEORGE:  I know, I know. 
  Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
 you just see if it's dried?"
"JERRY: No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
 it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
"GEORGE: You're gonna ""overdry"" it."
"JERRY: You, you can't ""overdry""."
"GEORGE: Why not?"
"JERRY: Same as you can't ""overwet"".  
 You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: 
 like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and 
 I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You 
 can't ""overdie"", you can't ""overdry""."
"GEORGE: [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to 
 them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?"
"JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? [George 
 stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops 
 working and George closes the lid]"
"GEORGE:  Look at that: they're done! It's 
 a miracle! "
""
"JERRY: ""Laundry-day"" is the only exciting day in the 
 live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine 
 is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles 
 happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs 
 the underwear: ""C'mon babe, let's gather"". You come by, 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
 you open up the lid and they'll: [shows how clothes are acting when 
 you open the lid]...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. 
 They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the 
 boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they 
 all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in 
 the hamper, the night before:  ""Tomorrow, the 
 dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!"" The dryer-door swings open 
 and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you 
 don't see him and then he goes down the road [shows how the sock 
 is going down the road]. They got buttons sowed on their faces: 
 join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent 
 for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? 
 Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains 
 all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe 
 you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first."
""
"JERRY:  If you know 
 what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, 
 hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, 
 no  Yeah? [to the door, while still 
 at the phone]"
"KRAMER:  Are you up?"
"JERRY:  Yeah... Yeah, people do move! 
 Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem 
 ."
"KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? "
"JERRY:  Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! 
 [actually I can't understand the name; maybe ""Kramer"" 
 wasn't named ""Kramer"" in the pilot!] I taped the game, 
 it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night 
 to watch this."
"KRAMER: Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes 
 two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?"
"JERRY:  Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! 
  Well what, 
 what happened in the game anyway?"
"KRAMER:  What happened? 
 Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the 
 refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to 
 that game."
"JERRY:  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't 
 been out of the building in ten years!"
"KRAMER: Yeah. [Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next 
 to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly 
 he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him 
 with a ""what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look"" and Kramer asks:] 
 Are you done with this?"
"JERRY: No."
"KRAMER: [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the 
 magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know."
"JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
"KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend."
"JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I 
 misread the whole thing."
"KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?"
"JERRY: I don't think so."
"KRAMER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... 
 a lawyer. "
"JERRY: That close, huh?"
"KRAMER: You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it 
 up]"
"JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
"KRAMER: Give me it...let me talk to her ."
"JERRY:  No believe me, I'm always up 
 at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane 
 get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices 
 something in the Mets-game on TV]..."
"KRAMER: A SLIDE!...Wow!"
"JERRY: ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got 
 it  ten-fifteen...No, 
 don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, 
 it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. [hangs 
 up the phone; to Kramer:] I, I don't believe it...That, that was 
 her. She wants to stay here!"
"[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy 
 mattress]"
"JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette 
 in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette 
 in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down 
 first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to 
 come down."
"GEORGE: Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed 
 for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in 
 an extra guy too? "
"JERRY:  Look, it's a very awkward situation, 
 I, I don't wanna be presumptuous."
"GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What 
 was the EXACT phrasing of the request?"
"JERRY: All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room..."
"GEORGE: A decent hotel-room..."
"JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient 
 if she stayed at my place."
"GEORGE: You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must 
 be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? [waves 
 with his handkerchief] This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!"
"JERRY:  This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, 
 where were you yesterday?"
"GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog 
 enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO, 
 GOOD DOG "
"KRAMER:  He really 
 likes you, George."
"GEORGE:  Well, that's flattering. "
"KRAMER: [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking 
 from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress 
 on the floor] Is this for that girl?"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"KRAMER: Why even give her an option?"
"JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: ""How to score on 
 spring break""."
"GEORGE: Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
 a ticket."
"JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
 bathroom."
"GEORGE: So what? That's good."
"JERRY: Now, how could that be good?"
"GEORGE: Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have 
 sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a 
 woman comin' over: ""I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these 
 matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS 
 do the opposite."
"JERRY: This is how you operate?"
"GEORGE: Yeah, I wish."
"JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink."
"KRAMER:  WHY EVEN GIVE HER 
 AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; 
 to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable."
"GEORGE: Yeah."
"KRAMER: ...How's the real estate-business?"
"GEORGE:... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? 
 Did you need something."
"KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?"
"GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that."
"KRAMER:  You keep me posted!"
"GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom 
 door], let's go!  You're on stage in 
 25 minutes."
""
"JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, 
 it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if 
 a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 
 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what 
 they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they 
 need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one 
 I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no 
 cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never 
 had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been 
 in a situation, when I thought to myself: ""I could use a cotton-ball 
 right now""...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need 
 them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, 
 they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen 
 these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, 
 they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, 
 ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em 
 is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, 
 that look like they've been through some horrible experience... 
 tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once 
 went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls 
 over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, 
 I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought 
 maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: 
 ""Let's move on""... The dating world is a world of pressure. 
 Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. 
 The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many 
 job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end 
 of it...ya know: ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man 
 for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the 
 people you'll be workin' with?""."
""
"JERRY: Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's 
 thinking?"
"GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman 
 what she's thinkin'."
"JERRY: Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick 
 up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation."
"GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna 
 know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
"JERRY: Really? How?"
"GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting. "
"JERRY: Uh-huh."
"GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets 
 you, that's a good sign."
"JERRY: Right."
"GEORGE: Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is 
 good."
"JERRY: ""Lip-area""."
"GEORGE: Ya know a hug: definitely good."
"JERRY: Hug is definitely good."
"GEORGE: Sure."
"JERRY: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders 
 are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
"GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that."
"JERRY: Ya know how they do that?"
"GEORGE: That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
"JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
 The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
 eyes?"
"GEORGE: Hand-sandwich."
"JERRY: Right."
"GEORGE: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so 
 much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the 
 eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her 
 hands over Jerry's eyes]"
"LAURA: Guess who?"
"JERRY: Hey, hey."
"JERRY: It's good to see you."
"LAURA: Hi."
"JERRY: This is my friend George."
"LAURA:  Hi, how nice to meet you."
"GEORGE: Hi, how are you?"
"JERRY: This is Laura."
"GEORGE: Laura, sure."
"JERRY:  I can't believe you're here."
"LAURA: Oh, thank you."
"JERRY:  Now that was an interesting greeting, 
 did you notice that, George?"
"GEORGE: Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That 
 wasn't in the manual, I don't know."
""
"JERRY: So uh, what do ya think?"
"LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad."
"JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, 
 make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off 
 her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get 
 you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"
"LAURA:  Actually uhm, do you have any wine?"
"LAURA: Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? [points to the 
 lamp]"
"JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. "
"LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering: would it be possible, and 
 if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?"
"JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What 
 is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' 
 anything?"
"LAURA: No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the 
 morning, then after that I'm right open."
"JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?"
"LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love 
 to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan."
"JERRY:  Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. 
  I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone 
 rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. 
  Uhm, it's for you."
"LAURA:  Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, 
 right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's 
 fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not 
 gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, 
 bye . Never get engaged."
"JERRY: You're engaged?"
"LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually 
 do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster."
"JERRY: You're engaged? "
"LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to 
 start thinking in terms of ""we"", uh, it's a very stressful 
 situation."
"JERRY: You're engaged! "
"LAURA: Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy..."
"JERRY: Yeah."
"LAURA: You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on 
 that boat."
"JERRY: Me too!"
""
"JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. 
 I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. 
 I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything 
 they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know 
 what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want 
 women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really 
 is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, 
 we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is 
 why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. 
 These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is 
 that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man 
 is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks:
