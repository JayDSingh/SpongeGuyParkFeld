"Season Episode Character Dialogue"
"JERRY: You know, why we're here? [he means: here in the ""Comedy 
              club""] To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single 
              most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people 
              talking about ""We should go out""? This is what they're 
              talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. 
              Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' 
              to find us, they don't know where we are. [imitates one of these 
              people ""tryin' to find us""; pretends his hand is a phone] 
              ""Did you ring?, I can't find him."" [imitates other person 
              on phone] ""Where did he go?""  
              ""He didn't tell me where he was going"". He must have gone 
              out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, 
              right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get 
              your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're 
              staring around, whatta you do? You go: ""We gotta be getting 
              back"". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to 
              sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? 
              Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go."
"[Scene: Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a 
              table.]"
"JERRY: Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. 
               The second button literally makes 
              or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, 
              you look like you live with your mother."
"GEORGE: Are you through? "
"JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?"
"GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall 
              considering the buttons."
"JERRY: Oh, you don't recall?"
"GEORGE:  Uh, no, not at 
              this time."
"JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when 
              you knew it. "
"WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld.  Mister 
              Costanza. "
"GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?"
"WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, 
              regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging 
              work. "
"JERRY: Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional 
              waitress."
"WAITRESS: Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you 
              on caffeine. "
"GEORGE: How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?"
"JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in."
"GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
              is coming in?"
"JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
"GEORGE: No, you didn't!"
"JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political 
              science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks 
              in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what..."
"GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry 
              and puts it on the table] what is she like?"
"JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth 
              about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the 
              conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking 
              with you, but, ya know, obviously much better."
"GEORGE:  So, ya know, what, what happened?"
"JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
"GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: This is great!"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
              you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
"JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
              called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
              maybe we'll get together. "
"GEORGE:  Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had 
              to come in""?"
"JERRY: Yeah, but..."
"GEORGE: ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? 
              ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?"
"JERRY: Yeah!"
"GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna 
              see this woman."
"JERRY:  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
"GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 
            "
"JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!"
"GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you 
              wanna know why she called you?"
"JERRY: Yes!"
"GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
              a B-plan of contingency!"
"JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
"GEORGE:  passes the table; George stops her 
              and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a 
              woman, right?"
"CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?"
"GEORGE: Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical 
              phone call, ya know, from a female point of view."
"JERRY:  Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, 
              how is she gonna know?"
"GEORGE:  Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
              she has to  come 
              to New York on business..."
"JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!  "
"GEORGE: and, and maybe  she'll see me when 
              she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
"CLAIRE: I'd have to say: uuhh, no. [George shows his note-block 
              to Jerry, it says very largely: NO]"
"GEORGE:  So why did she call?"
"CLAIRE: To be polite."
"GEORGE: To be polite, I rest my case."
"JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking 
              about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get 
              my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
"GEORGE: I'm not gonna watch you do laundry."
"JERRY: Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy""."
"GEORGE: Come on, I'm tired."
"CLAIRE:  Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll 
              perk up."
"GEORGE:  Right, 
              I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away 
              with a smile]"
"[Scene: Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring 
              at one of the dryers]"
"GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest 
              moment I've ever experienced. [walks away from the dryer; a man 
              passes George and Jerry]"
"JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's 
              got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first 
              load."
"GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the 
              city, I feel so cramped..."
"JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded."
"GEORGE: What?!"
"JERRY: Laura."
"GEORGE: I can't believe:  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
              THIS!"
"JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
"GEORGE:  'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his 
              fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask 
              you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
"JERRY: No."
"GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? 
              What is that? It's Saturday night!"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"GEORGE: What is that? It's ridiculous!  
              You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call 
              her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers 
              again] Signal!"
"JERRY: Maybe you're right."
"GEORGE: Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right."
"JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's 
              staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
"GEORGE:  I know, I know. 
               Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
              you just see if it's dried?"
"JERRY: No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
              it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
"GEORGE: You're gonna ""overdry"" it."
"JERRY: You, you can't ""overdry""."
"GEORGE: Why not?"
"JERRY: Same as you can't ""overwet"".  
              You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: 
              like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and 
              I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You 
              can't ""overdie"", you can't ""overdry""."
"GEORGE: [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to 
              them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?"
"JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? [George 
              stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops 
              working and George closes the lid]"
"GEORGE:  Look at that: they're done! It's 
              a miracle! "

"JERRY: ""Laundry-day"" is the only exciting day in the 
              live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine 
              is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles 
              happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs 
              the underwear: ""C'mon babe, let's gather"". You come by, 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              you open up the lid and they'll: [shows how clothes are acting when 
              you open the lid]...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. 
              They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the 
              boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they 
              all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in 
              the hamper, the night before:  ""Tomorrow, the 
              dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!"" The dryer-door swings open 
              and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you 
              don't see him and then he goes down the road [shows how the sock 
              is going down the road]. They got buttons sowed on their faces: 
              join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent 
              for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? 
              Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains 
              all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe 
              you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first."

"JERRY:  If you know 
              what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, 
              hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, 
              no  Yeah? [to the door, while still 
              at the phone]"
"KRAMER:  Are you up?"
"JERRY:  Yeah... Yeah, people do move! 
              Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem 
              ."
"KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? "
"JERRY:  Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! 
              [actually I can't understand the name; maybe ""Kramer"" 
              wasn't named ""Kramer"" in the pilot!] I taped the game, 
              it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night 
              to watch this."
"KRAMER: Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes 
              two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?"
"JERRY:  Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! 
               Well what, 
              what happened in the game anyway?"
"KRAMER:  What happened? 
              Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the 
              refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to 
              that game."
"JERRY:  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't 
              been out of the building in ten years!"
"KRAMER: Yeah. [Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next 
              to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly 
              he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him 
              with a ""what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look"" and Kramer asks:] 
              Are you done with this?"
"JERRY: No."
"KRAMER: [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the 
              magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know."
"JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
"KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend."
"JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I 
              misread the whole thing."
"KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?"
"JERRY: I don't think so."
"KRAMER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... 
              a lawyer. "
"JERRY: That close, huh?"
"KRAMER: You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it 
              up]"
"JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
"KRAMER: Give me it...let me talk to her ."
"JERRY:  No believe me, I'm always up 
              at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane 
              get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices 
              something in the Mets-game on TV]..."
"KRAMER: A SLIDE!...Wow!"
"JERRY: ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got 
              it  ten-fifteen...No, 
              don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, 
              it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. [hangs 
              up the phone; to Kramer:] I, I don't believe it...That, that was 
              her. She wants to stay here!"
"[Scene: Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy 
              mattress]"
"JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette 
              in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette 
              in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down 
              first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to 
              come down."
"GEORGE: Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed 
              for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in 
              an extra guy too? "
"JERRY:  Look, it's a very awkward situation, 
              I, I don't wanna be presumptuous."
"GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What 
              was the EXACT phrasing of the request?"
"JERRY: All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room..."
"GEORGE: A decent hotel-room..."
"JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient 
              if she stayed at my place."
"GEORGE: You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must 
              be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? [waves 
              with his handkerchief] This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!"
"JERRY:  This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, 
              where were you yesterday?"
"GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog 
              enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO, 
              GOOD DOG "
"KRAMER:  He really 
              likes you, George."
"GEORGE:  Well, that's flattering. "
"KRAMER: [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking 
              from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress 
              on the floor] Is this for that girl?"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"KRAMER: Why even give her an option?"
"JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: ""How to score on 
              spring break""."
"GEORGE: Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
              a ticket."
"JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
              bathroom."
"GEORGE: So what? That's good."
"JERRY: Now, how could that be good?"
"GEORGE: Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have 
              sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a 
              woman comin' over: ""I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these 
              matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS 
              do the opposite."
"JERRY: This is how you operate?"
"GEORGE: Yeah, I wish."
"JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink."
"KRAMER:  WHY EVEN GIVE HER 
              AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; 
              to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable."
"GEORGE: Yeah."
"KRAMER: ...How's the real estate-business?"
"GEORGE:... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? 
              Did you need something."
"KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?"
"GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that."
"KRAMER:  You keep me posted!"
"GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom 
              door], let's go!  You're on stage in 
              25 minutes."

"JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, 
              it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if 
              a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 
              'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what 
              they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they 
              need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one 
              I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no 
              cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never 
              had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been 
              in a situation, when I thought to myself: ""I could use a cotton-ball 
              right now""...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need 
              them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, 
              they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen 
              these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, 
              they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, 
              ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em 
              is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, 
              that look like they've been through some horrible experience... 
              tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once 
              went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls 
              over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, 
              I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought 
              maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: 
              ""Let's move on""... The dating world is a world of pressure. 
              Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. 
              The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many 
              job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end 
              of it...ya know: ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man 
              for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the

              thinking?"
"GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman 
              what she's thinkin'."
"JERRY: Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick 
              up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation."
"GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna 
              know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
"JERRY: Really? How?"
"GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting. "
"JERRY: Uh-huh."
"GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets 
              you, that's a good sign."
"JERRY: Right."
"GEORGE: Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is 
              good."
"JERRY: ""Lip-area""."
"GEORGE: Ya know a hug: definitely good."
"JERRY: Hug is definitely good."
"GEORGE: Sure."
"JERRY: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders 
              are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
"GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that."
"JERRY: Ya know how they do that?"
"GEORGE: That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
"JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""?

              The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
              eyes?"
"GEORGE: Hand-sandwich."
"JERRY: Right."
"GEORGE: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so 
              much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the 
              eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her 
              hands over Jerry's eyes]"

"JERRY: This is Laura."
"GEORGE: Laura, sure."
"JERRY:  I can't believe you're here."
"LAURA: Oh, thank you."

              did you notice that, George?"

              her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get 
              you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"

              if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?"
"JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What 
              is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' 
              anything?"

              morning, then after that I'm right open."
"JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?"
"LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love 
              to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan."

              fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not 
              gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK,

"JERRY: You're engaged?"
"LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually 
              do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster."
"JERRY: You're engaged? "
"LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to 
              start thinking in terms of ""we"", uh, it's a very stressful 
              situation."

              they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know

              offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
"ELAINE: Unless you're married to a dictator.."

        so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that 
        I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable 
        prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very 
        nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know 
        I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am 
        among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what 
        annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with 
        that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes 
        company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the 
        truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!""

"JERRY: Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my 
        parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of 
        it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been 
        sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it.  Alright,

        same!"
"JERRY: What?"
"GEORGE: When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue 
        on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and 
        I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"", 
        and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,"" 
        and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like 
        I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was 
        the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father 
        naked."

"GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue."

        Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you 
        kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes 
        the rhyme) And you are it! "

        the shoes, and the hat."

"ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic."
"RAVA:  Or maybe he's dead."
"JERRY:  So what do you write, children's books?"
"RAVA: That's Ray."
"RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. 
        My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. 
        And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to 
        serve you. "
"JERRY:  ..Alright."
"RAVA: And we have to get back to work. "
"JERRY:  I gotta get to the airport."
"RAY: Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save 
        arrival, Sire."
"JERRY: The toilet brush is under the sink.. "
"JERRY: I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because 
        there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, 
        you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm 
        really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."" 
        And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. 
        I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you 
        couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you 
        couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"""
"JERRY: He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of 
        the dishwashing liquid.  He cleaned out the bottom 
        of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this.  He 
        cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. 
        How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!"
"ELAINE: There's no Rubber Man."
"JERRY: ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man 
        and Plastic Man."
"ELAINE: I'm leaving."
"JERRY: Where are you going?"
"ELAINE: To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript."
"JERRY: Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens 
        it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! "
"ELAINE:  So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! 
        I think because of your request.."
"RAVA: Demand.  There's 
        Ray.. late as usual."
"RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and 
        future king of comedy, ""Jerry the First,"" gracing our humble 
        abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty."
"JERRY: Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that 
        apartment."
"RAY: But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, 
        a celebration of life."
"JERRY:  Shouldn't you be out on a ledge 
        somewhere?"
"RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?"
"ELAINE: Jerry? ..Jerry!"
"JERRY:  What?"
"RAVA:  Ray, would you give me a hand?"
"RAY: Yeah, I'm coming!"
"JERRY:  I think that's the statue from my house. 
        That looks like the statue from my house!"
"ELAINE: What statue?"
"JERRY: I had a statue!"
"ELAINE: You have a statue? I never saw a statue."
"JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!"
"ELAINE: Since when?"
"JERRY: What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This 
        guy ripped me off!"
"RAY: Do you take sugar?"
"JERRY: I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!"
"ELAINE: Do you realize what you're saying?"
"JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of 
        my house!"
"RAY: Lemon?"
"ELAINE: Are you sure?"
"JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure."
"ELAINE: Ninety-nine percent sure?!"
"RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the 
        soul."
"RAY: The pastries!"
"ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence."
"JERRY: Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, 
        he has the same exact statue in his apartment."
"ELAINE: I never saw the statue."
"JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?"
"ELAINE: I don't know."
"JERRY: ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and 
        dials)"
"ELAINE: Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me."
"JERRY: Don't worry..  Kramer! Kramer!.. It's 
        Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry 
        Seinfeld!.. "
"Jerry: Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right 
        in the pan. Okay, bye.  My mother.. She forgot how to make French 
        Toast. You know how mothers are."
"RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He 
        ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere."
"JERRY: My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot 
        down there in the summer. You ever been down there?"
"RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the 
        pastries were the food of the gods."
"JERRY: ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial."
"ELAINE:  Oh, see you tomarrow morning."
"RAY: Oh, how about dinner?"
"JERRY: No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. "
"JERRY:  Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs 
        up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they 
        can do."
"KRAMER: Let's go get him."
"JERRY: Yeah, right."
"GEORGE: We can't just let him get away with this."
"JERRY: Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? 
        He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things 
        to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy."
"KRAMER: You wanta go get him?"
"ELAINE: Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it."
"GEORGE: Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect 
        the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!"
"ELAINE: George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?"
"GEORGE: Who is this Rava?"
"KRAMER: I say we get him."
"ELAINE: No!"
"GEORGE: Let me just call him."
"JERRY: I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and 
        Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on 
        the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, 
        Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King 
        of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one 
        with the blue lady?  Will you shut up?!  
        Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava 
        to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, 
        Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. "
"ELAINE:  Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it."
"GEORGE: Oh, he stole it?"
"ELAINE: C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. 
        What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?"
"GEORGE:  I thought you said one o' 
        clock."
"JERRY: Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his ""M.O."""
"GEORGE: Remember, don't take any crap."
"JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it."
"GEORGE: I'll be right here."
"JERRY:  That's comforting.. Shh. He's here.  
        Ray?"
"RAY:  Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked 
        me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me 
        into?"
"JERRY: ..Well, I didn't.."
"RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got 
        the statue."
"GEORGE:  I wonder why."
"JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything."
"RAY: Give it back?"
"JERRY: Yeah."
"RAY: What are you talking about?"
"JERRY: What are you talking about?"
"GEORGE:  What is he talking about.."
"RAY: I'm talking about the statue."
"JERRY: Yeah, me too."
"RAY: Give it back to whom?"
"JERRY: Me."
"GEORGE:  Yeah, him."
"RAY: You?"
"JERRY: Yeah. Me."
"RAY: I'm not getting this."
"GEORGE:  You already got it."
"JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then 
        I saw it in your house."
"RAY: What are you saying?"
"JERRY: What am I saying?"
"GEORGE:  Take a wild guess."
"RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?"
"GEORGE:  What a mind."
"JERRY: Well, I.."
"RAY: I can't believe what I'm hearing."
"JERRY: I can't believe what I'm hearing."
"GEORGE:  I can't believe what I'm hearing."
"RAY: For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop."
"GEORGE:  A pawn shop?"
"JERRY: A pawn shop?"
"RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments."
"GEORGE:  And cleaning them out."
"JERRY: Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house."
"RAY: What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?"
"GEORGE:  Again with the Rava."
"RAY: You want her."
"JERRY:  No, she's a little too cheery for me."
"RAY:  She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do 
        you understand?!"
"JERRY: I know Finland. They're neutral."
"RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?"
"JERRY: No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times."
"GEORGE:  ""Oh, I find you so charming"" ..You wuss."
"JERRY:  Did you call me a wuss?"
"RAY: What did you say?"
"JERRY: I said luss.. I'm at a luss.."
"RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it."
"JERRY: That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table 
        in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea."
"RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, 
        the guy retired and moved to Singapore."
"GEORGE:  Singapore?! Do you hear this?"
"RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand 
        have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over."
"GEORGGE: That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! 
         You stole the statue! You're 
        a theif! You're a liar!"
"JERRY:  George."
"RAY:  Who is this?"
"GEORGE: I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!"
"RAY: What's going on here?"
"GEORGE: GUILTY!"
"RAY: Your friend is crazy."
"GEORGE: Oh, I'm crazy!"
"JERRY:  George, george.."
"RAY: I've got to get going. I have a class."
"GEORGE: Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. 
        I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record 
        of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!"
"RAY: Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond 
        Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name."
"GEORGE: You mean alias."
"RAY: You are starting to make me angry."
"GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen!"
"RAY:  I hope you think about what you've done here today.. 
        and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes 
        to leave)"
"JERRY: Hey, Ray."
"RAY:  Yes?"
"JERRY: How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? 
        It was like a brand-new nozzle!"
"ELAINE: Nervous?"
"RAVA: Why should I be?"
"ELAINE: Yeah. Right."
"RAVA: Your notes are very insightful."
"ELAINE: The book is great. Did you go out last night?"
"RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable."
"ELAINE: They all are.."
"RAVA: Was Jerry?"
"ELAINE: I can't remember.."
"RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations."
"ELAINE: Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. 
        I am not getting involved."
"RAVA:  So you think he stole it?!"
"ELAINE: Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence."
"RAVA: I admit nothing!"
"MAN: Will you put that cigarette out, please?"
"ELAINE: Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and 
        it's in your apartment."
"RAVA: Maybe you think we're in cahoots."
"ELAINE: No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence."
"RAVA: Yes, that's all, a coincidence!"
"ELAINE: A big coincidence."
"RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!"
"ELAINE: No, that's a big coincidence."
"RAVA: That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and 
        big coincidences!"
"ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences."
"RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks 
        everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, 
        or just coincidences?  ..Well?! Well?!.."
"MAN: Will you put that cigarette out?!"
"RAVA:  Maybe I put it out on your face! 
         It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our 
        love. You're trying to destroy us."
"ELAINE: Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?"
"GEORGE:  Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is 
        it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, 
        fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs 
        up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me."
"KRAMER: I'm not happy about this."
"ELAINE: Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?"
"GEORGE: There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's 
        made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."
"JERRY: Really?"
"GEORGE:  Sure. Why not?"
"ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel 
        of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook."
"JERRY: Can't you talk to your boss?"
"ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think 
        you're funny at all."
"KRAMER: I'm not happy about this."
"JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the 
        next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh 
        brand of justice.."
"GEORGE: Yeah.. He'll have my parents!"
"KRAMER: Police! Open up!"
"RAY: Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's 
        wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the 
        wall - face first)"
"KRAMER: Freeze, mother!"
"RAY: Hey.."
"KRAMER: Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em!  You're 
        in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. 
        and uh, uh.. murder."
"RAY: Murder?!"
"KRAMER: Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!"
"RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else."
"KRAMER:  Is your name Ray?"
"RAY: Yeah."
"KRAMER:  Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue 
        from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)"
"RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?"
"KRAMER: Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's 
        your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any 
        more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?"
"RAY: Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about."
"KRAMER: Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. "
"JERRY: Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?"
"GEORGE: Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!"
"KRAMER: Yeah."
"JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?"
"KRAMER: Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court."
"GEORGE: I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders.  
        I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!"
"KRAMER: Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending 
        the statue crashing to the ground)"
"JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, 
        everybody has their own little personal security things - things that 
        they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You 
        go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's 
        gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? 
        I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the 
        toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move 
        on."
"LEVITAN: Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George.  
              Get"
"GEORGE: That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm 
              gone."
"KRAMER: Hey."
"JERRY: Hey."
"KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again 
              last"
"JERRY: Well, what'd you say?"
"KRAMER: I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to 
              do this for years. I"
"JERRY: What's his problem?"
"KRAMER: No job. No women."
"JERRY: He called the right guy."
"KRAMER: What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him 
              to live"
"JERRY: All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
"KRAMER: Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?"
"JERRY: Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers 
              in tune with"
"KRAMER: How 'bout if I put a few things --"
"JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --"
"KRAMER: Well, you're going over there."
"JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your 
              guys. You"
"KRAMER: Have you ever met my guys?"
"JERRY: No. I can't say as I have."
"KRAMER: Well!"
"JERRY: All right. Put 'em on top."
"KRAMER: Ah!"
"JERRY: Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I 
              get it done"
"VIC: I'll have to charge you for another machine."
"JERRY: Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines 
              are"
"GEORGE: Guess what."
"JERRY: How did you know I was here?"
"GEORGE: Kramer. Guess what."
"JERRY: I don't know."
"GEORGE: I quit my job."
"JERRY: Get outta here."
"GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore."
"VIC: You can have this on Monday."
"JERRY: What happened? Levitan?"
"GEORGE: I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, 
              and then I"
"JERRY: You and your toilets."
"GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw. "
"JERRY: So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something 
              else"
"GEORGE: Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. "
"JERRY: So what are you gonna do?"
"GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports."
"JERRY: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?"
"GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or 
              something."
"JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. "
"GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe 
              I could"
"JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments."
"GEORGE: What about that?"
"JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and 
              people that"
"GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair."
"JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
"GEORGE: Movies. I like to watch movies. "
"JERRY: Yeah. Yeah."
"GEORGE: Do they pay people to watch movies?"
"JERRY: Projectionists."
"GEORGE: That's true."
"JERRY: But you gotta know how to work the projector. "
"GEORGE: Right."
"JERRY: And it's probably a union thing."
"GEORGE:  Those unions.  Okay. Sports,...movies. 
              What about a"
"JERRY: Talk show host. That's good."
"GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. 
              Someone"
"JERRY: Really?"
"GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where 
              do you"
"JERRY: Well, that's where it gets tricky. "
"GEORGE: You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna 
              be a talk"
"JERRY: I wouldn't think so. "
"GEORGE: It's all politics."
"JERRY: All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
"GEORGE: This could have been a huge mistake."
"JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this 
              through."
"GEORGE:  What should I do?"
"JERRY: Maybe you can just go back."
"GEORGE: Go back?"
"JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened."
"GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning 
              like it"
"JERRY: Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you 
              seriously. "
"GEORGE: Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened."
"JERRY: Never happened."
"GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?"
"JERRY: So what? You're entitled."
"GEORGE: I'm emotional."
"JERRY: That's right. You're emotional."
"GEORGE: Never happened."
"JERRY: Never happened."
"GEORGE: How ya doin'?"
"GLENDA: What are you doing here?"
"GEORGE: What? I work here."
"GLENDA: I thought you quit."
"GEORGE: What quit?  Who quit? "
"DAN: Bill, how was your weekend?"
"BILL: Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?"
"DAN: Fine weekend. "
"GEORGE: Yeah. Good weekend."
"DAN: Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing.  Lisa 
              was a"
"GEORGE: Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor."
"LEVITAN: Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?"
"AVA: I got a little tied up."
"LEVITAN: I'll bet you did."
"LEVITAN: I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party 
              for Rick"
"GEORGE: What? "
"LEVITAN: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?"
"GEORGE: When?"
"LEVITAN: Friday. "
"GEORGE: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? 
              You"
"LEVITAN: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?"
"GEORGE: Come on. Will you stop it."
"LEVITAN: No brains? No ability?"
"GEORGE: Teasing."
"LEVITAN: Okay. I want you outta here."

"JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. 
        I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing 
        suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go 
        down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear 
        one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've 
        got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing 
        suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear 
        if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like 
        floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that 
        you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You 
        bump into somebody you know: ""No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for

"MORTY: So, what took you so long?"
"JERRY: We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place."
"HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you 
        up."
"JERRY: What's the difference?"
"HELEN: You could have used our car."
"JERRY: I don't wanna use your car."

        goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go 
        back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. 
        It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry

"JERRY: Yeah."

"JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?"
"HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do?

"JERRY: He could have said: ""Thank you, I like it too"" and put 
        it back in his pocket."
"HELEN: He loves that pen."
"MORTY: Oh come on!"
"HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he 
        goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use 
        it."
"JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
"HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet."
"JERRY: Well, he was wrong."
"HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone 
        in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about 
        it right now. "

        me the pen, but I don't really need it."
"JACK: You what?"
"JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he 
        tends the pen to Jack)"
"JACK: Well I mean..."
"JERRY: Take it."
"JACK: All right! "
"MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's 
        pen."
"JACK: Whose pen?"
"MORTY: His pen."
"JACK: This happens to be my pen."
"MORTY: You didn't give it to him."
"JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it."
"MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?"
"JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You 
        offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?"
"MORTY: You said you didn't want it!"
"JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!"
"MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the 
        hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?"
"JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch 
        tape!"
"MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over 
        for it!"
"JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!"
"MORTY: I don't want it!"
"JACK: I don't want it!"
"MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch 
        tape, and get the hell out of here!"
"JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?"
"MORTY: Aah!  The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. 
        Well that'it for them."
"JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's 
        happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is 
        it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?"
"HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there 
        tonight. "
"JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?"
"MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee."
"JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening."
"ELAINE:  Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?"
""
"PHOTOGRAPHER: Say astronaut."
"ELAINE: Say what?  Say what?"
"JERRY:  You took too many of those pills."
"MORTY: Astronaut?"
"HELEN: Say it."
"ELAINE:  Astro...naut!"
"MORTY: Good. O.K.  What about last year 
        when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?"
"JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering 
        with his wife Stella)"
"JERRY:  Uncle Leo."
"LEO: Hello!"
"STELLA: Morty are you nervous?"
"MORTY: What nervous?"
"LEO:  What's with the 
        sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?"
"JERRY: I've got a black eye."
"STELLA:  Hello."
"JERRY: Elaine, this is my aunt Stella."
"HELEN:  STELLA! STELLA!"
"JERRY:  Her back hurts."
"STELLA: Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week."
"LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk."
"JERRY: No, no."
"LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three 
        times already."
"ELAINE:  STELLA! STELLA!"
"LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material 
        for you."
"MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!"
"LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the 
        whole bunch of you!  Oh, here's Jack. We should 
        sit down."
"STELLA:  This better be good. 
        I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this."
"HELEN:  I hate her like 
        poison."
"JACK:  Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, 
        Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. 
        And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone 
        yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan."
"MORTY:  Slept on the job? "
"JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, 
        dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these 
        qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine 
        who's still druggy)"
"HELEN:  He's joking."
"JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents."
"MORTY:  That's what you say."
"JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the 
        crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. 
        "
"MORTY:  Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about 
        that! "
"JERRY: Dad!"
"MORTY:  He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. 
        Tell them about that!"
"JACK: He gave it to me!"
"MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!"
"JACK: I'm not sitting down!"
"JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate 
        while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my 
        dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table 
        and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the 
        microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is 
        over.)"
"HELEN: Jerry, do your act."
"JERRY:  I can't. Nobody's even listening."
"HELEN: They're all gonna leave."
"JERRY:  Oh God!  huh... Hey! How you folks 
        doing tonight? "
"JERRY:  Have you ever noticed how they always 
        give you the peanuts on the planes?"
"JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is 
        a peanut?"
"HELEN:  Do the dog routine."
"JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!"
"ELAINE:  STELLA!"
""
"CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least 
        five days."
"ELAINE: Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?"
"JERRY: There must be some mistake."
"CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not."
"ELAINE:  Five days. Here."
"HELEN:  So we have you for five more days!"
"JERRY:  Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean 
        you just gonna be..."
"ELAINE: Excuse me?"
"JERRY: Nothing."
"EVELYN: Good morning."
"JERRY: Hi Evelyn."
"EVELYN:  Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?"
"HELEN: I don't think so."
"EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. 
        He says Jack has no case."
"HELEN: I'll ask him when he gets up."
"EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the 
        bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out 
        for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to 
        suck up to."
"MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could 
        sleep on that thing?"
"HELEN: I was very comfortable."
"EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out."
"HELEN: It's in the constitution."
"MORTY:  Who are you?"
"CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor."
"MORTY: What are you kidding me?"
"ELAINE:  Five more days?"
"JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday 
        we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It 
        will go by like that. "

"Gavin: Would you take care of Farfel?"
"Jerry: Farfel?"
"Jerry: The dog? The dog??"

"Jerry: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg<br/>
              creams) You gotta put the syrup in first."
"Elaine: No, milk."
"Jerry: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."

"Jerry: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
"Elaine: I can't believe he hasn't called."
"Jerry: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his<br/>
              dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
"Kramer: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
"Jerry: Why?"
"Elaine: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
"Kramer: I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
"Jerry: You're breaking up?"
"Kramer: Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You<br/>
              know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their<br/>
              feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,<br/>
              watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah."
"Elaine: Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
"Kramer: Woah, you didn't like her?"
"Elaine: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant<br/>

"Kramer: How come you never said anything?"

              they stop seeing them."
"Kramer: I tell you."
"Jerry: You. I'm talking about people."
"Elaine: Are we still going to the movies tonight?"

"Elaine: Just me and George?"
"Jerry: Sure."
"Elaine: But we need you."
"Jerry: What do you need me for?"
"Elaine: Because... Yeah?"
"George: Prognosis Negative!"
"Elaine: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. <br/>
              Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just<br/>
              put some newspapers down or something?"
"Jerry: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's<br/>
              right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!"
"Elaine: Just me and George alone?"

              ha!!!"
"Jerry: I can't go."
"George: Can't go, Why not?"

"Jerry: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight."
"George: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
"Jerry: No, I don't want that smell in the house."
"George: You spritz a little Lysol on it."
"Jerry: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of<br/>

"George: So we're not going?"
"Jerry: Nah. You two go."
"George: Oh. You still wanna go?"
"Elaine: Do you?"
"George: If you want."
"Elaine: It's up to you."
"Jerry: Go ahead."
"Elaine: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,<br/>
              you wanna see Ponce de Leon?"
"George: Ponce de Leon? Okay.  You sure you don't wanna go?"
"Jerry: I want to but I can't."

              everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can<br/>
              switch apartments for the night."
"Jerry: No."
"George: What about this--"
"Jerry: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."

"George: So how long did you live there?"
"Elaine: About three years."
"George: That's pretty long."
"Elaine: Hmm."
"George: It's not that long, really."
"Elaine: Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same<br/>
              time, then stop. Another silence."
"George: And then you came here."
"Elaine: Yeah. So I've been here about six years."
"Jerry: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from<br/>
              me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!<br/>
"
"Kramer: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do<br/>
              something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to<br/>
              society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? <br/>
              Couldn't respect myself."
"George: I like herbal tea."
"George: Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure."
"Elaine: Jerry likes Morning Thunder."
"George: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?"
"Elaine: Yeah."
"George: Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
"Elaine: Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it."

"Elaine: No."

"George: Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
"Kramer: Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,<br/>

"Jerry: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on<br/>
              Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. <br/>
              Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.  That's it, Farfel! <br/>
              Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're<br/>
              checking out!<br/>
"
"Elaine: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many<br/>
              situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one."
"Jerry: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
"Elaine: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of<br/>
              you."
"Jerry: Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on<br/>
              down.  What?"
"Elaine: Do you have to?"
"Jerry: What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not<br/>
              sure this is a dog."
"Elaine: You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
"Jerry: I'm in the book and I have a machine."
"Elaine: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them<br/>
              there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them."
"Jerry: Really? How late are they open?"
"Jerry: What?"
"Elaine: What is it?"
"Kramer: I went back with Ellen."
"Elaine: Terrific."
"Jerry: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
"Elaine: Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
"Kramer: Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?"
"Jerry: I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
"Kramer: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you<br/>
              don't know me."
"Elaine: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
"Jerry: What are you doing?"
"Kramer: I'm getting my pot."
"Elaine: Kramer, we like her."
"Jerry: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?"
"Elaine: I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit."
"Jerry: I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said<br/>
              anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes.  <br/>
              Yeah?"
"George: Prognosis Negative!"
"Jerry: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
"Elaine: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
"Jerry: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
"Elaine: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the<br/>
              movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight."
"Jerry: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
"Elaine: We'll see it Sunday."
"George: Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
"Elaine: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
"George: What does this mean?"
"Jerry: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De<br/>
              Leon."
"George: What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
"Jerry: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go<br/>
              to the bathroom."
"George: Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
"Jerry: I don't know, regular human time?"
"George: Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?"
"Jerry: Why shouldn't I go here?"
"Elaine: Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure<br/>
              you get your seats and then go to the bathroom."
"George: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?"
"Elaine: Yeah."
"Jerry: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
"George: Hey, go."
"Elaine: Who's stopping you?"
"George: What, are you doing me a favor?"
"Elaine: Like we care if you go to the bathroom."
"George: How's it going?"
"Elaine: Good. Good. You?"
"George: Things are good."
"Elaine: Boy, he takes such a long time."
"George: I know."
"Elaine: You know what he does in there? He gargles."
"George: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?"
"Elaine: Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
"George: How come we never hear him?"
"Elaine: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,<br/>
              watch."
"George: Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
"Elaine: We talked about that already."
"George: Oh.<br/>
"
"George: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm<br/>
              out of conversation."
"Jerry: So what are calling me six times a day?"
"George: All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,<br/>
              I could always read the sports section."
"Jerry: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire."
"George: Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out."
"Jerry: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
"George: Nothing except Prognosis Negative."
"Jerry: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.<br/>
"
"Elaine: Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! <br/>
              When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!"
"Elaine: Shut up. Shut up!  Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my<br/>
              god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your<br/>
              dog tonight or he has humped his last leg."
"George: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but<br/>
              it's this or nothing."
"Jerry: I don't know what to do."
"George: What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
"Jerry: I know, I know."
"George: So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
"Jerry: It is kind of silly."
"George: Of course it is."
"Jerry: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
"George: Exactly."
"Jerry: It's not like she's *in* the movie."
"George: Right."
"Jerry: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I<br/>
              mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these<br/>
              circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies."
"George: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
"Jerry: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level<br/>
              of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,<br/>
              let's just go."
"George: Good."
"Jerry: Saving movies."
"George: Ridiculous!"
"Jerry: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble."
"George: Oh, you're dead.<br/>

"Gavin: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. <br/>

"Elaine: Yeah, that's what is is, a caper. "
"George: You'll do it? "
"Elaine: What the hey. "
"George: Yeaah, beautiful...[They try to hit a high five, but George hits 
        Elaine in the forehead.] Sorry... "
"Jerry: Well, I've been looking forward to it. "
"Babu: Oh, how did you hear about us? "
"Jerry: Eh, people, people are talking. "
"Babu: Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both. "
"Jerry: Non smoking would be great. "

        hot face cloth for your pleasure. "
"Jerry: Thank you.  "
"Babu: Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans. "

"George: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. "
"Monica: But why? "
"George: I can't concentrate in front of you. "
"Monica: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean 
        anything. "
"George: Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring 
        a persons intelligence. "
"Monica: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it. "
"George: Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse 
        me, I would like to get started please. "
"Monica: Good luck. "
"George: Don't need it. "
"Elaine: What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 
        minutes. "

"Elaine: All right, what time do you want me back here. "
"George: Eh, twenty to three. "
"Elaine: Ok. "
"George: Thanks again. "
"Elaine: All right. "
"George: And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. 
      "
"Jerry: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur 
        I must say. "
"Babu: It is in deed my pleasure. "
"Jerry: Oh, please... "
"Babu: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today... "
"Elaine: Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast. "
"Babu: Tea and toast. "
"Jerry: Eat something! Babu... "
"Elaine: Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni. "
"Babu: Oh, very good choice. Very good. "
"Jerry: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. "
"Elaine: I know. "
"Kramer: Hey. "
"Jerry: Hey. "
"Kramer: Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... "
"Elaine: Hey. "
"Kramer: This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. 
        Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket 
        back. "
"Jerry: So? "
"Kramer: Well, I'm not giving it back. "
"Jerry: Why not? "
"Kramer: Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're 
        attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him? "
"Kramer: Oh, gees... "
"Elaine: Yeah, ok... "
"Kramer: Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of 
        limitations on that? "
"Jerry: Statute. "
"Kramer: What? "
"Jerry: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. "
"Kramer: No, statue. "
"Jerry: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. "
"Kramer: Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it 
        statue or statute of limitations? "
"Elaine: Statute. "
"Kramer: Oh, I really think you're wrong. "
"Elaine: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long 
        of time. "
"Kramer: What test? "
"Elaine: An IQ test. "
"Kramer: Why do you take an IQ test? "
"Elaine: It's for George. "
"Kramer: George? "
"Elaine: Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later? "
"Kramer: Why are you taking an IQ test for George? "
"Elaine: Would you please?! "
"Kramer: What, is it for a job or something? "
"Elaine: Later! "
"Kramer: You're positive it's statute? "
"Elaine: Yes, yes! "
"Babu: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...[gives Kramer a hot 
        towel and Kramer screams and falls from his chair.] "
"Monica: George? "
"George: Yeah? "
"Monica: The door is locked. "
"George: Oh, it's locked? "
"Monica: I need to get something. "
"George: Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. "
"Monica: George! "
"George: Wish I could. "

"Babu: Please, forgive me, please... "
"Jerry: Go ahead, I'll take care of it. "
"Babu: I'm very sorry. Tell your friends! "
"Jerry: It's all right, she was cheating anyway. "
"Babu: You're a very kind man. "
"Jerry: Babu, you're Pakistani? "
"Babu: Yes, Pakistani, yes. "
"Jerry: Babu, may I say something? "
"Babu: Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen. "
"Jerry: I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that 
        perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed 
        to franks and beans for example. "
"Babu: But there are no Pakistani people here. "
"Jerry: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant 
        in the whole neighborhood. "
"Babu: Yes, you see everything, don't you? "
"Jerry: Well, not everything. I do what I can. "
"Babu: I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani 
        restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, 
        very special. "
"Elaine: It was an accident. "
"George: What did you go on a picnic? "
"Elaine: Babu Bhatt did it. "
"George: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? "
"Monica: Time's up George. "
"George: Ok.  Here you go. "
"Monica: How did you do? "
"George: Piece of cake. "
"Monica: What happened to the test? "
"George: What? I spilled some food on it. "
"Monica: Food? What food? "
"George: What are you talking about? "
"Monica: Where did you get food? "
"George: From my pocket. "
"Monica: What? "
"George: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. "
"Monica: And coffee? "
"George: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. "
"Monica: Where did you get the coffee? "
"George: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, 
        from the grocery store. "
"Monica: How did you get there? "
"George: I walked. "
"Monica: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave. 
      "
"George: I climbed out the window. "
"Monica: You climbed out the window? "
"George: Of course. "
"Monica: Why didn't you go out the door? "
"George: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here. 
      "
"Monica: You are a fascinating man, George Costanza. "
"Jerry: Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not 
        me. "
"Elaine: You're very special. "
"Kramer: Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell 
        him you don't know where I am. "
"Jerry: Of course, I always do. "
"Kramer: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 
      "
"Elaine: Just give it back to him. "
"Kramer: Oh, he'll have to kill me.  "
"Jerry: Hey Georgie! "

"George: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ ! "
"Elaine: 85? "
"Jerry: Well, well, well... "
"Elaine: He's coming up? "
"Jerry: Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should 
        be here in a few seconds. "
"Elaine: Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous. "
"Jerry: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions 
        about hunting and testicles... "
"George: Oh, hello professor. "
"Elaine: George, I cannot believe... "
"George: Please... "
"Elaine: No there has got be a mistake. "
"George: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father 
        gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. "
"Jerry: But an 85? "
"Elaine: There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's 
        name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate. "
"Elaine: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again. "
"George: Whow, forget it. "
"Elaine: Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose? 
      "
"George: You could do worst! "
"Elaine: No, no, I guarantee it. "
"George: All right, I'll ask her. "

        grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week. "
"Babu: You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money. 
      "
"Jerry: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm. "
"Babu: You wish to eat? "
"Jerry: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen 
        and tell your chef I want the works. "
"Babu: Very good. "
"Elaine: What are you doing? "
"Kramer: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. "
"Elaine: What's going on? "
"Elaine: Why did you come in here for? "
"Kramer: I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live. "
"Elaine: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out 
        of here. "
"Kramer: I thought you took the test. "
"Elaine: I had to take it again. "
"Kramer: How come? "
"Elaine: What's the difference?!! "
"Kramer: Well, you can't leave now. "

"Jerry: There.  So, how did it go?"
"George: I think he was impressed. "
"Elaine: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice. "
"Jerry: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours."
"Elaine: Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to 
              hold it."
"Jerry: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold 
              it."
"Elaine: One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon."
"George: Told you."
"Jerry: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel 
              like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress."
"George: Do I really have to buy her something?"
"Jerry: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy 
              her a gift. How about this?"
"George: What is that? Is that cashmere?"
"Jerry: Yeah. She would love cashmere."
"George: Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world 
              that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive."
"Jerry: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600."
"George: Wow. Excuse me, Miss?"
"Woman: Yes?"
"George: How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?"
"Woman:  Oh, here. This is why."
"George: What? I don't see anything."
"Woman: See this red dot?"
"George: Oh yeah."
"Jerry: Oh it's damaged. "
"George:  Well it's not really damaged. 
              85 dollars huh?"
"Woman: There's no exchanges on this."
"George: You think she would care about the red dot?"
"Jerry: It's hard to say. "
"George: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?"
"Jerry: Well I can see it."
"George: Yeah, but you know where it is."
"Jerry: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?"
"George: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?"
"Jerry: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is."
"George: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview? 
            "
"Jerry: You want me to take an overview?"
"George: Please."
"Jerry: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away 
              with something. That's my overview."
"Jerry: Yeah so?"
"Elaine: He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking 
              again."
"Jerry: Oh boy, can you smell it?"
"Elaine: No. I can't smell it."
"Jerry: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking."
"Elaine: You don't always smell someone from a drink."
"Jerry: Yes you do."
"Elaine: What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?"
"Jerry: Yes you would."
"Jerry: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor? "
"Kramer: Okay."
"Jerry: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?"
"Kramer: You can smell me without the drink."
"Elaine: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but 
              I can't smell it. "
"Kramer: Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?"
"Jerry: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. 
              It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner."
"Kramer: All right."
"Jerry: I don't smell anything."
"Elaine: Maybe we're too close to the bottle."
"Jerry: Yeah."
"George:  It's George."
"Jerry: Come on up."
"Kramer: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for 
              this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords 
              you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots 
              of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk 
              all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch."
"George: Hello everybody."
"Kramer: Hey.  I'm going to tell 
              you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going 
              to tell you. I think that you are terrific. "
"George:  Thank you."
"Elaine: Hey what's that?"
"George: It's an early Christmas present."
"Elaine: Christmas present? For who?"
"George: For you."
"Elaine: *gasp*  Get out of here. "
"Kramer: Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. 
              Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose 
              as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, 
              why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n..."
"Jerry: Kramer. Yeah that'll do."
"Elaine:  Oh George, this is beautiful. Is 
              this cashmere?"
"George: Of course it's cashmere."
"Elaine: Oh, I love cashmere. "
"George: Well who doesn't."
"Elaine: My, George this must have cost a fortune."
"George: Ahh, money."
"Elaine: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?"
"Jerry: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people 
              happy."
"Elaine: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever 
              given me."
"George: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out 
              already. It's for special occasions this thing."
"Kramer: What's that red dot on your sweater?"
"Elaine: What?"
"George: Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it."
"Elaine: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot."
"George: What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here 
              for a second. Do you see anything here?"
"Jerry:  Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know."
"Elaine: What don't you know?"
"Jerry: I don't know."
"Elaine: Well do you see it or don't you?"
"Jerry: Ahem. Say that again?"
"Elaine: Do you see it or don't you?"
"Jerry: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question."
"Jerry: Now what did you ask me again."
"Elaine: You're still here. You're a dynamo."
"George: I can't believe I get paid for this."
"Elaine: I'll see you tomorrow."
"George: How you doing?"
"Jerry: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are 
              you, how did you do that?"
"George: Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning 
              woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning 
              women, chambermaids."
"Jerry: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too."
"George: Why is that?"
"Jerry: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead."
"George: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, 
              her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... "
"Jerry: Convulsing?"
"George: Convulsing?"
"Jerry: I don't know, I'm trying to help you."
"George: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink."
"Jerry: You don't drink."
"George: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to 
              her."
"Jerry: So you started drinking."
"George: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know 
              if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew 
              she was mopping the floor with me."
"Jerry: So how was it?"
"George: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
"Jerry: Good thing the cleaning lady was there."
"Elaine: Dick was fired."
"Jerry: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over 
              to the right, and none of this would have happened."
"Elaine: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down 
              at all?"
"Jerry: What are you saying?"
"Elaine: I'm not saying anything."
"Jerry: You're saying something."
"Elaine: What could I be saying?"
"Jerry: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something."
"Elaine: If I was saying something I would have said it."
"Jerry: Well why don't you say it?"
"Elaine: I said it."
"Jerry: What did you say?"
"Elaine: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you."
"Jerry: Yeah?"
"George:  It's George."
"Jerry: Come on up."
"Elaine: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy 
              that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? 
               Ooookay, you just gave me the answer."
"Jerry: No I didn't."
"Elaine: Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression."
"Jerry: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I 
              have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe."
"Elaine: How much did he save?"
"Jerry: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question 
              (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of 
              it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could 
              even think of that. That's what you were seeing."
"George: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning 
              the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. 
              She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, 
              I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
"Jerry: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. 
              She's asking me all kinds of questions."
"George: Did you tell her anything?"
"Jerry: No."
"George: Do you swear?"
"Jerry: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear."
"George: Oh you told her didn't you."
"Jerry: No."
"Elaine: Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot 
              was on it because you could get it at a discount?"
"George: What? Did I what?"
"Elaine: You did didn't you."
"George: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in 
              the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a 
              word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful 
              Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you 
              at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas."
"Elaine: Well Jerry told me that you did."
"George: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to 
              say anything."
"Jerry: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you."
"George: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when 
              I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. 
              I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
              distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. 
              I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry 
              is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and 
              starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look 
              at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot."
"George: This is for you."
"Lady: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared 
              for me."
"George: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that 
              you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. 
              What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. "
"Lady: Okay, okay, can I open it now?"
"George: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like 
              this very much."
"Lady: Oh! Is that cashmere? "
"George: Of course it's cashemere."
"Lady: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!"
"George: Just a little something for Christmas."
"Lady: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came 
              to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. 
              I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", 
              and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words 
              ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and 
              he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. 
              But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater 
              and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with 
              the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want 
              the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere."
"George: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on 
              now, try it on later."
"Lady: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful."
"George: Take it off. You're going to ruin it."
"Lady:  What's this?"
"Jerry: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand 
              blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like 
              the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but 
              I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to 
              spend as much time as you can."
"Dick: The only stench is comming from you."
"Audience: Oooooh."
"Jerry: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and 
              gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not 
              my fault you're back on the wagon."
"Dick: It's off the wagon."
"Jerry: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from 
              town to town?"
"Dick: I don't know."
"Jerry: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of 
              those bottles along the way?"
"Dick: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy."
"Jerry: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?"
"Dick: What the hell do you know about wagons?"
"Jerry: I know enough not to get on them."
"Boss: I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention 
              that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse 
              on the desk in your office. Is that correct?"
"George: Who said that?"
"Boss: She did."
"George: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you 
              I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said 
              anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of 
              thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of 
              offices and I tell you peope do that all the time."
"Boss: You're fired."
"George: Well you didn't have to say it like that."
"Boss: I want you out of here by the end of the day."
"George: What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability 
              there?"
"Boss: Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this."
"Elaine: You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman."
"George: You never had sex in the office before?"
"Elaine: No. I once made out with someone but that was it."
"George: Alright so you made out with someone."
"Elaine: Well that's not sex."
"George: Kissing is sex."
"Elaine: Kissing is not sex."
"Jerry: George?"
"George: Jerry."
"Elaine: Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?"
"George: No."
"Jerry: George?"
"George: Over here."
"Elaine: What are you doing here?"
"Jerry: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up."
"Elaine: Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?"
"Jerry: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance."
"Elaine: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's 
              on purpose."
"Jerry: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night."
"Dick: Merry Christmas."
"Elaine: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear."
"George: Hide, hide under the desk."
"Elaine: Ow, ow move over."
"Jerry: Get off of me."
"Elaine: I've got no room."
"Dick: Is that cashmere?"
"George: Of course it's cashmere."
"Dick:  What's this?"
"Jerry: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into 
              an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either 
              telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And 
              those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think 
              he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's 
              finally off the wagon."
"Dick: You mean on the wagon."
"Jerry: Don't get smart.

"Jerry: Can we just go in already?"
"George: What are we gonna tell her?"
"ElainElaine: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed."
"George: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, 
              then "
"ElainElaine:  Oh, remind me to talk to you about something 
              later."
"Jerry: What about?"
"George: Hey, hey! We're discussing something!"
"Jerry: I know, but I'm distracted now."
"George: What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her."

"George: Uh, can we cut to the chase?"
"Jerry: ""Cut to the chase""?"
"George: Yeah..."
"Jerry: What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?"
"George: A lot of people say it."
"Jerry: I would lose that."
"George:  What's *that*?"
"Jerry: ""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!"
"George:  ...Yes it is."
"ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from"
"JERRY: Really, an intervention ..."
"George: Y'know people, we got a situation over here!"
"ELAINE: Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it."
"JERRY: Me? Why me?"
"ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to 
              you."
"Jerry: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load..."
"GEORGE: All right, OK, I'm goin' in."
"JERRY: We've got to talk about this "
"ELAINE: All right."
"GEORGE: Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful."
"NOEL: No.."
"GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
"Jerry: You play a *Hell* of a piano."
"Elaine: Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved."
"NOEL: Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. 
              I was"
"Elaine: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you."
"Noel: Well then, what was she laughing at?"
"Jerry: Pez?"
"NOEL: Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her? "
"GEORGE: Me, uh, uh, no, ..."
"JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort 
              of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that 
              rude and ignorant."
"ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her 
              leg."
"JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something 
              on her leg she's still the one who laughed."
"NOEL: I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. "
"ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody 
              is holding her back against every fibre in her being."
"GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being 
              she'll be very careful "
"GEORGE: All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something 
              to eat."
"NOEL: I don't feel like it tonight."
"JERRY: We'll be outside"
"ELAINE: Yeah"
"JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your 
              fingers before you play?"
"N: I just crack my knuckles."
"GEORGE: We'll have a good time"
"N: I don't feel like it"
"GEORGE: Ah, come on"
"N: I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!"
"GEORGE: Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and 
              we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is 
              fine ok, uh, fine, .. "
"JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for 
              getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place."
"ELAINE: What? How?"
"JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer 
              was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. 
            "
"ELAINE: So? What happened? "
"JERRY: What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing 
              out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, "
"ELAINE: Shut up! "
"JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners 
              nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same."
"ELAINE: Whar about Kramer?"
"JERRY: He's the same!"
"JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in 
              two years. I don't have a good apartment for "
"KRAMER:  Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade 
              that killed Marty Benson? "
"JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention 
              for him. We're having it here. "
"KRAMER: Can I get in on that?"
"JERRY: What do you think? It's like a poker game?"
"KRAMER: Is Elaine going?"
"JERRY: Yeah"
"KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did."
"JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her."
"KRAMER: So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"
"JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid 
              you might be interfering while we're intervening. "
"GEORGE: It's George"
"JERRY: Stop smelling your arm."
"KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You 
              spray it on and you smell like you just "
"JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe 
              I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
"KRAMER: Tell me about it!"
"JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing 
              department at Calvin Klein. "
"GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over. "
"JERRY: She broke up with you?"
"GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had 
              this terrible phone conversation. "
"JERRY: What was on the list?"
"GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my 
              car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink, "
"JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted, "
"GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted 
              to go out to dinner and she said "
"JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?"
"GEORGE: Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. 
              you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. "
"KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?"
"GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have 
              no hand."
"KRAMER: Break up with her "
"GEORGE: What?"
"KRAMER: You break up with her. You reverse everything that way."
"JERRY: A preemptive breakup. "
"GEORGE: A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got 
              nothing to lose. "
"GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you."
"NOEL: You're breaking up with me?"
"GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you."

"GEORGE: Never expected this did you?"
"NOEL: I thought everything was fine."
"GEORGE: Well, live and learn."
"NOEL: I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we 
              have fun doing the crossword puzzles?"
"GEORGE: Kind of."
"NOEL: I'm very confused."
"GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid."
"NOEL: I thought,..."
"GEORGE: Now, stop it ..."
"NOEL: What do you want, I can make you happy."
"GEORGE: When you're playing the piano do you think about me?"
"NOEL: I don't know."
"GEORGE: This is what I'm talking about."
"NOEL: OK, I'll think about you."
"GEORGE: All the time."
"NOEL: All the time? ... OK, All the time."
"GEORGE: I can't hear you."

"KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from 
              the beach?"
"STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard."
"KRAMER: Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
"STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell 
              like dead"

"Steve: What's the plan?"
"JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking."
"GUY: No, we all have to talk."
"ELAINE: What's the order?"

"GEORGE: It's George"
"JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him."
"GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender."
"ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
"GUY: Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?"
"ELAINE: You're getting warm."
