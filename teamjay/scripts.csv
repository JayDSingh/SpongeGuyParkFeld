"Morty: So, how did she find out?"
"Morty: So, what are you? Afraid of her?"
"Jerry: Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!"
"Jerry: What else did she say on the phone?"
"Helen: Whatever I wrote down."
"Jerry: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?"
"Helen: Who am I, Rich Little?"
"Morty: Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding."
"Jerry: Yeah, but now I'm nervous."
