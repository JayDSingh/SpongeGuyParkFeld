"<p>Jerry: Hey!</p>"
"<p>Morty: Ah, there he is!</p>"
"<p>Helen: Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...</p>"
"<p>Helen: Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Ma, will you stop?</p>"
"<p>Helen: No, why should we take over your apartment?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.</p>"
"<p>Helen: Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: No, he's making a bouillabaisse.</p>"
"<p>Morty: Depends on the firm.</p>"
"<p>Morty: What's the matter? You need a lawyer?</p>"
"<p>Morty: So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?</p>"
"<p>Helen: Why not?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.</p>"
"<p>Helen: He used to go with her...</p>"
"<p>Helen: Which one is she?</p>"
"<p>Morty: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Oh yeah, she's great.</p>"
"<p>Helen: So, how come nothing materialized there?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...</p>"
"<p>Helen: I know what it was...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: You don't know what it was...</p>"
"<p>Helen: So, what was it?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Well, we fight a lot for some reason...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...</p>"
"<p>Helen: Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.</p>"
"<p>Helen: I can see if there was a *weight* problem...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.</p>"
"<p>Helen: You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I know, I know...</p>"
"<p>Morty: Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.</p>"
"<p>Helen: Idiot... [To Jerry] So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: That's got *nothin'* to do with it.</p>"
"<p>Morty: How about Loni Anderson?</p>"
"<p>Helen: Where do you get Loni Anderson?</p>"
"<p>Morty: Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?</p>"
"<p>Helen: I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...</p>"
"<p>Helen: And this other one's ""the one""?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I dunno, maybe...</p>"
"<p>Morty: So ask Elaine there for the number.</p>"
"<p>Helen: How could you still see her if your not interested?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: We're *friends*.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Oh yeah...</p>"
"<p>Morty: Well, go up to the office.</p>"
"<p>Helen: Up to her office?</p>"
"<p>Morty: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I guess...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: You mean ""stakeout"" the lobby?</p>"
"<p>Helen: Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!</p>"
"<p>Morty: He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.</p>"
"<p>Morty: He pretends he *bumped* into her!</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...</p>"
"<p>George: What does she look like?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I dunno. Hard to say.</p>"
"<p>George: What actress does she remind you of?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Loni Anderson.</p>"
"<p>George: Loni Anderson?!</p>"
"<p>Jerry: What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I'm a little nervous.</p>"
"<p>George: Yeah, me too...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?</p>"
"<p>George: You came to see me; I work in the building.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: What do you do?</p>"
"<p>George: I'm an *architect*.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: You're an *architect*?</p>"
"<p>George: I'm not?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I don't see architecture comin from you...</p>"
"<p>George: I suppose *you* could be an architect...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!</p>"
"<p>George: We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: What is *his* name?</p>"
"<p>George: Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.</p>"
"<p>George: No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr..... </p>"
"<p>Jerry: Art Corr...</p>"

"<p>Jerry: Corvelay?</p>"
"<p>George: Yeah, right.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Well, what does *he* do?</p>"
"<p>George: He's an importer.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Just imports, no exports?</p>"
"<p>George: He's an importer/exporter, okay? </p>"
"<p>George: Say, did Elaine ever call you back?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: No, I guess she's still mad.</p>"
"<p>George: I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Never.</p>"
"<p>Jerry: Wait a second... That's her... on the right.</p>"
"<p>George: I forgot who I am! Who am I?!</p>"
"<p>Jerry: You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.</p>"

"<p>George: I'm, uh, I'm an architect.</p>"
"<p>Vanessa: Really. What do you design?</p>"
"<p>George: Uh, railroads, uh...</p>"
