Our plan for monday

1st checkpoint in this project: be able to store data as csv in a desired standard format, so that we can write functions that work for all 
three data sets of SpongeBob, Seinfeld, and South Park. Since the South Park data is cleaned, we should use that csv file as a guide. It 
has the layout of 

10,1,Stan,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away.
"
for each line. 

2nd checkpoint: think of measurements to take and write code to obtain statistics and establish an analysis based on these measurements.

3rd checkpoint: run the code on the data and obtain measurements, then look at the results.

Final task: report the most interesting and accurate conclusions to be drawn from the data in an article in The Labyrinth.
