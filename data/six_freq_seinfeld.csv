"jerry"," You know, why we're here?  To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single 
              most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people 
              talking about ""We should go out""? This is what they're 
              talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. 
              Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' 
              to find us, they don't know where we are.  
              ""Did you ring?, I can't find him.""  ""Where did he go?""  
              ""He didn't tell me where he was going"". He must have gone 
              out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, 
              right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get 
              your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're 
              staring around, whatta you do? You go ""We gotta be getting 
              back"". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to 
              sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? 
              Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go."
"jerry"," Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. 
               The second button literally makes 
              or breaks the shirt, look at it it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, 
              you look like you live with your mother."
"george"," Are you through? "
"jerry"," You do of course try on, when you buy?"
"george"," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall 
              considering the buttons."
"jerry"," Oh, you don't recall?"
"george","  Uh, no, not at 
              this time."
"jerry"," Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when 
              you knew it. "
"george"," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?"
"jerry"," Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional 
              waitress."
"george"," How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?"
"jerry"," Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in."
"george"," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
              is coming in?"
"jerry"," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
"george"," No, you didn't!"
"jerry"," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political 
              science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... There's no milk in here, what..."
"george"," Wait wait wait, what is she,  what is she like?"
"jerry"," Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth 
              about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the 
              conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking 
              with you, but, ya know, obviously much better."
"george","  So, ya know, what, what happened?"
"jerry"," Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
"george"," Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," This is great!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
              you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
"jerry"," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
              called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
              maybe we'll get together. "
"george","  Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had 
              to come in""?"
"jerry"," Yeah, but..."
"george"," ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? 
              ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"george"," No...no...no, I hate to tell you this you're not gonna 
              see this woman."
"jerry","  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
"george"," How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 
            "
"jerry"," To be polite? You are insane!"
"george"," All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you 
              wanna know why she called you?"
"jerry"," Yes!"
"george"," You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
              a B-plan of contingency!"
"jerry"," Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
"george","  passes the table; George stops her 
              and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a 
              woman, right?"
"george"," Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical 
              phone call, ya know, from a female point of view."
"jerry","  Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, 
              how is she gonna know?"
"george","  Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
              she has to  come 
              to New York on business..."
"jerry"," Oh you are beautiful!  "
"george"," and, and maybe  she'll see me when 
              she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
"george","  So why did she call?"
"george"," To be polite, I rest my case."
"jerry"," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking 
              about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get 
              my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
"george"," I'm not gonna watch you do laundry."
"jerry"," Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy""."
"george"," Come on, I'm tired."
"george","  Right, 
              I knew I felt something...! "
"george"," Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin'...this is the dullest 
              moment I've ever experienced. "
"jerry"," Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's 
              got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first 
              load."
"george"," I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the 
              city, I feel so cramped..."
"jerry"," And you didn't even hear how she sounded."
"george"," What?!"
"jerry"," Laura."
"george"," I can't believe  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED 
              THIS!"
"jerry"," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
"george","  'Cause it's signals, Jerry , it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask 
              you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
"jerry"," No."
"george"," She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? 
              What is that? It's Saturday night!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," What is that? It's ridiculous!  
              You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call 
              her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal!  Signal!"
"jerry"," Maybe you're right."
"george"," Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right."
"jerry"," This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's 
              staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
"george","  I know, I know. 
               Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
              you just see if it's dried?"
"jerry"," No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
              it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
"george"," You're gonna ""overdry"" it."
"jerry"," You, you can't ""overdry""."
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," Same as you can't ""overwet"".  
              You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead 
              like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and 
              I shoot you you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You 
              can't ""overdie"", you can't ""overdry""."
"george","  Any questions?"
"jerry"," How could she not tell me where she was staying? "
"george","  Look at that they're done! It's 
              a miracle! "
"jerry"," ""Laundry-day"" is the only exciting day in the 
              live of clothes. It is...no, think about it the washing machine 
              is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles 
              happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs 
              the underwear ""C'mon babe, let's gather"". You come by, 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              you open up the lid and they'll ...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. 
              They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the 
              boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they 
              all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in 
              the hamper, the night before  ""Tomorrow, the 
              dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!"" The dryer-door swings open 
              and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you 
              don't see him and then he goes down the road . They got buttons sowed on their faces 
              join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent 
              for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? 
              Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains 
              all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe 
              you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first."
"jerry","  If you know 
              what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, 
              hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, 
              no  Yeah? "
"kramer","  Are you up?"
"jerry","  Yeah... Yeah, people do move! 
              Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem 
              ."
"kramer"," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? "
"jerry","  Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! 
               I taped the game, 
              it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night 
              to watch this."
"kramer"," Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew... You got any meat?"
"jerry","  Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! 
               Well what, 
              what happened in the game anyway?"
"kramer","  What happened? 
              Well, they STUNK, that's what happened!  Ya know, I almost wound up going to 
              that game."
"jerry","  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't 
              been out of the building in ten years!"
"kramer"," Yeah.  
              Are you done with this?"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer","  When you're done, let me know."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
"kramer"," I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend."
"jerry"," No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I 
              misread the whole thing."
"kramer"," You want me to talk to her?"
"jerry"," I don't think so."
"kramer"," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... 
              a lawyer. "
"jerry"," That close, huh?"
"kramer"," You better believe it. "
"jerry"," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
"kramer"," Give me it...let me talk to her ."
"jerry","  No believe me, I'm always up 
              at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane 
              get in?...I got my friend George to take me......"
"kramer"," A SLIDE!...Wow!"
"jerry"," ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got 
              it  ten-fifteen...No, 
              don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, 
              it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye.  I, I don't believe it...That, that was 
              her. She wants to stay here!"
"jerry"," If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette 
              in his mouth the whole way.  Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down 
              first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to 
              come down."
"george"," Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed 
              for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in 
              an extra guy too? "
"jerry","  Look, it's a very awkward situation, 
              I, I don't wanna be presumptuous."
"george"," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What 
              was the EXACT phrasing of the request?"
"jerry"," All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room..."
"george"," A decent hotel-room..."
"jerry"," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient 
              if she stayed at my place."
"george"," You can't be serious. This is New York city there must 
              be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag?  This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!"
"jerry","  This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, 
              where were you yesterday?"
"george"," I think I was affected by the caffeine.  HO, HO, HO, 
              GOOD DOG "
"kramer","  He really 
              likes you, George."
"george","  Well, that's flattering. "
"kramer","  Oh, he's getting' a drink of water.  Is this for that girl?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Why even give her an option?"
"jerry"," This is a person I like, it's not ""How to score on 
              spring break""."
"george"," Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
              a ticket."
"jerry"," Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
              bathroom."
"george"," So what? That's good."
"jerry"," Now, how could that be good?"
"george"," Because filth is good...Whatta you think rock stars have 
              sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a 
              woman comin' over ""I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these 
              matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS 
              do the opposite."
"jerry"," This is how you operate?"
"george"," Yeah, I wish."
"jerry"," Let me just wipe the sink."
"kramer","  WHY EVEN GIVE HER 
              AN OPTION FOR?  It's unbelievable."
"george"," Yeah."
"kramer"," ...How's the real estate-business?"
"george","... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? 
              Did you need something."
"kramer"," Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?"
"george"," Well, I might be getting in to that."
"kramer","  You keep me posted!"
"george"," I'm aware of you, all right, let's go , let's go!  You're on stage in 
              25 minutes."
"jerry"," The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, 
              it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if 
              a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 
              'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what 
              they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they 
              need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one 
              I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no 
              cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never 
              had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been 
              in a situation, when I thought to myself ""I could use a cotton-ball 
              right now""...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need 
              them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, 
              they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen 
              these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, 
              they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, 
              ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em 
              is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, 
              that look like they've been through some horrible experience... 
              tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once 
              went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls 
              over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, 
              I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought 
              maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town 
              ""Let's move on""... The dating world is a world of pressure. 
              Let's face it a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. 
              The only difference between a date and a job-interview is not many 
              job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end 
              of it...ya know ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man 
              for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the 
              people you'll be workin' with?""."
"jerry"," Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's 
              thinking?"
"george"," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman 
              what she's thinkin'."
"jerry"," Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective I've gotta pick 
              up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation."
"george"," Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna 
              know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
"jerry"," Really? How?"
"george"," 'Cause it's all in the greeting. "
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"george"," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets 
              you, that's a good sign."
"jerry"," Right."
"george"," Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is 
              good."
"jerry"," ""Lip-area""."
"george"," Ya know a hug definitely good."
"jerry"," Hug is definitely good."
"george"," Sure."
"jerry"," Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders 
              are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
"george"," That's so brutal, I hate that."
"jerry"," Ya know how they do that?"
"george"," That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
"jerry"," Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
              eyes?"
"george"," Hand-sandwich."
"jerry"," Right."
"george"," I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so 
              much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the 
              eyes..."
"jerry"," Hey, hey."
"jerry"," It's good to see you."
"jerry"," This is my friend George."
"george"," Hi, how are you?"
"jerry"," This is Laura."
"george"," Laura, sure."
"jerry","  I can't believe you're here."
"jerry","  Now that was an interesting greeting, 
              did you notice that, George?"
"george"," Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That 
              wasn't in the manual, I don't know."
"jerry"," So uh, what do ya think?"
"jerry"," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, 
              make yourself at home.  So uh, can I get 
              you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"
"jerry"," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. "
"jerry"," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What 
              is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' 
              anything?"
"jerry"," Really? What would you like to do?"
"jerry","  Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. 
               I'm just, I'm really glad you're here.  Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. 
               Uhm, it's for you."
"jerry"," You're engaged?"
"jerry"," You're engaged? "
"jerry"," You're engaged! "
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Me too!"
"jerry"," I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. 
              I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. 
              I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything 
              they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know 
              what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want 
              women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really 
              is we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, 
              we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is 
              why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. 
              These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is 
              that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man 
              is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks 
              "
"jerry"," So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of 
              me. One of"
"jerry"," Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you 
              that's"
"jerry"," What's that one?"
"elaine"," ""Coccoon II The Return"". I guess they didn't 
              like it up there..."
"jerry"," Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton, 
              if"
"elaine"," Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen *everything*."
"jerry"," Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this."
"elaine"," Oh, lovely..."
"jerry"," Yeah..."
"elaine"," What do you think their parents think?"
"jerry"," ""So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?"""
"elaine"," Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's 
            "
"jerry"," Pamela? Do I know her?"
"elaine"," Yeah, you met her when we were going out."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, right..."
"elaine"," You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?"
"jerry","  No."
"elaine"," Blonde hair remember? Glasses?  Have you *totally* 
              blocked"
"jerry"," Riverside Drive."
"elaine"," Right! In fact... No, never mind..."
"jerry"," Well, what is it?"
"elaine"," Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night 
              at some"
"jerry"," Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little 
              deal here."
"elaine"," What little deal?"
"jerry"," I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family 
              wedding I "
"elaine"," A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?"
"jerry"," Y'know, my parents are coming in for this..."
"elaine"," They're coming in?"
"jerry"," Yeah, tomorrow."
"elaine"," Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?"
"jerry"," No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across."
"elaine"," Why does he do that?"
"jerry"," Doesn't think anyone can tell?"
"jerry"," So c'mon, do we have a deal?"
"elaine"," A *wedding*?"
"jerry"," There's a lot of people to mock..."
"elaine"," Alright, what the Hell."
"jerry"," Great!"
"elaine"," C'mon lets go, c'mon..."
"jerry"," Was I supposed to bring something?"
"elaine"," You could have."
"jerry"," I met her *one* time..."
"elaine"," It is not necessary."
"jerry"," What did you say then?"
"elaine"," Sssshhhhhh!!!"
"elaine"," Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry."
"jerry"," Hi, happy birthday."
"jerry"," I didn't bring anything."
"jerry"," Oh, Okay  I'm sorry, I didn't know 
              what"
"jerry"," I'm in for five..."
"jerry","  Uh-oh... What do we have here..."
"jerry"," Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly."
"jerry"," Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my 
              tattoos."
"jerry","  What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, 
              she's"
"jerry"," Friend of a friend. And you?"
"elaine"," Oh, Jerry!"
"jerry","  Oh no, not *now*..."
"elaine"," I had this dream last night and you were in it."
"jerry"," Oh really...  Oh God, I gotta get out of this..."
"elaine"," You were you, but, you weren't you..."
"jerry"," No kidding...  Why is this happening? Please, 
              make "
"elaine"," I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and 
              you were "
"jerry","  This is *brutal*..."
"elaine"," You turned around and you had these wooden teeth..."
"jerry"," How do you like that...  Can I turn now? Is 
              this "
"elaine"," Jerry? Are you listening to me?"
"jerry"," Yes, I *heard* you."
"jerry","  Thank *you*, Pamela!"
"jerry","  So, you're a lawyer..."
"jerry","  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and Taft. "
"jerry"," Imagine, spelling ""Mom"" with two O's..."
"jerry"," Comedian."
"jerry","  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and Taft."
"jerry","  I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't 
              even "
"jerry","  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and "
"jerry"," That wasn't so bad, really..."
"elaine"," Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners."
"jerry"," Why? What did I do?"
"elaine"," Well, I just don't appreciate these little ""courtesy 
              responses"", "
"jerry"," I was listening!"
"elaine"," No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... ""conversation""."
"jerry"," No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had."
"elaine"," Uh-huh..."
"jerry"," Where you had, uh, wooden teeth."
"elaine"," No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! 
              *I* "
"jerry"," Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?"
"elaine"," So nothing... Nothing..."
"jerry"," Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic 
            "
"jerry"," Hey!"
"jerry"," This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents 
              are in your"
"jerry"," What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you 
              here..."
"jerry"," Ma, will you stop?"
"jerry"," I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door."
"jerry"," No, he's making a bouillabaisse."
"jerry"," So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at 
              these big"
"jerry"," Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you 
              think they "
"jerry"," No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, 
              but I "
"jerry"," Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask 
              her."
"jerry"," Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, she's great."
"jerry"," Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno..."
"jerry"," You don't know what it was..."
"jerry"," Well, we fight a lot for some reason..."
"jerry"," And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry..."
"jerry"," Oh, she is, she absolutely is."
"jerry"," No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided."
"jerry"," I know, I know..."
"jerry"," That's got *nothin'* to do with it."
"jerry"," What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't 
              ""the one""."
"jerry"," I dunno, maybe..."
"jerry"," I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women 
              with her,"
"jerry"," We're *friends*."
"jerry"," Oh yeah..."
"jerry"," I guess..."
"jerry"," You mean ""stakeout"" the lobby?"
"jerry"," Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea..."
"george"," What does she look like?"
"jerry"," I dunno. Hard to say."
"george"," What actress does she remind you of?"
"jerry"," Loni Anderson."
"george"," Loni Anderson?!"
"jerry"," What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?"
"jerry"," Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate 
              it."
"george"," Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, 
              you think"
"jerry"," I'm a little nervous."
"george"," Yeah, me too..."
"jerry"," If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?"
"george"," You came to see me; I work in the building."
"jerry"," What do you do?"
"george"," I'm an *architect*."
"jerry"," You're an *architect*?"
"george"," I'm not?"
"jerry"," I don't see architecture comin from you..."
"george"," I suppose *you* could be an architect..."
"jerry"," I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else..."
"george"," Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which 
              is remote."
"jerry"," Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!"
"george"," We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building."
"jerry"," What is *his* name?"
"george"," Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son."
"jerry"," Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up."
"george"," No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr..... "
"jerry"," Art Corr..."
"george"," ...velay..."
"jerry"," Corvelay?"
"george"," Yeah, right."
"jerry"," Well, what does *he* do?"
"george"," He's an importer."
"jerry"," Just imports, no exports?"
"george"," He's an importer/exporter, okay? "
"george"," Say, did Elaine ever call you back?"
"jerry"," No, I guess she's still mad."
"george"," I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?"
"jerry"," Never."
"jerry"," Wait a second... That's her... on the right."
"george"," I forgot who I am! Who am I?!"
"jerry"," You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay."
"george"," Vandelay!"
"jerry"," Corvelay!"
"george"," Let me be the architect, I can do it!"
"jerry"," Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there... 
            "
"jerry"," This is George.  I'm sorry..."
"george"," Nice to meet you."
"jerry"," Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
"jerry"," Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here 
              in the"
"george"," Yeah, Art *Vandelay*."
"jerry"," I don't know. He's an importer."

"jerry"," He's an importer/exporter."
"george"," I'm, uh, I'm an architect."
"george"," Uh, railroads, uh..."
"george"," They can..."
"jerry"," Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night."
"jerry"," Oh, that guy was your *cousin*!"
"jerry"," Friend!"
"george"," I'll just, uh, get a paper..."
"jerry"," So, um, do you date immature men?"
"jerry"," Ma, will you go already?"
"jerry"," What are you doing?!"
"jerry"," You can't look in there, we're playing!"
"kramer"," Hey Morty!  Salad dressing?"
"jerry"," Look."
"jerry"," Maybe!"
"jerry"," Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's 
              cheating!"
"kramer"," ""Quo""? That's not a word."
"jerry"," Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes 
              on this."
"jerry"," She said *what*?"
"jerry"," She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*..."
"jerry"," She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator..."
"jerry"," Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably 
              told "
"jerry"," Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!"
"jerry"," What else did she say on the phone?"
"jerry"," Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?"
"jerry"," Yeah, but now I'm nervous."
"jerry"," ""Quone""?"
"jerry"," ""Quone""? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have 
              to challenge that."
"kramer"," No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's 
              a "
"jerry"," I am challenging..."
"kramer"," Quone to quone something."
"jerry"," Uh-huh..."
"jerry"," No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off..."
"kramer"," Nah, we need a *medical* dictionary! If a patient gets 
              difficult, "
"jerry"," You must have quite a time down there. "
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone..."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah..."
"jerry"," Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it..."
"jerry"," That's perfect.  Could you excuse me one 
              second. "
"jerry"," How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld."
"elaine"," Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes."
"jerry"," Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until 
              we get"
"elaine"," Oh no, let's do it now."
"jerry"," Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--"
"elaine"," Okay..."
"jerry"," No, I'm gonna take my car."
"jerry"," Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so 
            "
"elaine"," Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. 
              It was "
"elaine"," Oh, bye. Good to see you."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine."

"jerry"," Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?"
"elaine"," I ""staked"" out his health club."
"jerry"," When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand 
              up "
"jerry"," Y'know I think that even if you've had a relationship with 
              someone,"
"jerry"," So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this"
"jerry"," Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella,"

"george"," Definitely."
"jerry"," Oh, than just get rid of it. You won't have any"
"george"," No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment"
"george"," Oh, it's a great place, it's uh ""two-bedroom"" 
              uh, west"
"george"," I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is"
"jerry"," She wanted to thank us for the apartment. [very"
"elaine"," I can't believe I lost the deposit on that u-hall. [I"
"jerry"," If only the coin hadn't hit the table."
"george"," The table is interference, you know it!"
"jerry"," It is not!"
"george"," It is too!"
"elaine"," My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel."
"george"," Hi, Carol."
"george"," We're really glad for ya. "
"elaine"," Couldn't be happier. "
"jerry"," It's wonderful. "
"george"," We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes."
"george"," Nice meeting you. [shakes Carol's hand; they sit down"
"jerry"," How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh,"
"jerry"," Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end 
              of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end 
              of the meal system, because"
"george"," I never heard him say anything really funny."
"jerry"," But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. 
              I'm sure he's got super humor."
"george"," You would think that, but either you're born with a sense 
              of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go 
              from the red sun of Krypton all"
"jerry"," Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected 
              by the yellow sun of Earth?"
"george"," I don't know but he ain't funny."
"elaine"," I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late."
"jerry"," No problem."
"elaine"," I dropped a grape."
"george"," Pardon?"
"elaine"," I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I 
              couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes 
              looking for this stupid grape. I"
"jerry"," Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find 
              it."
"elaine"," No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm 
              going out with - "
"jerry"," Robert."
"elaine"," Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic 
              to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even 
              go into his apartment, you"
"george"," Guys with cats.. I don't know."
"jerry"," I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing 
              -"
"elaine"," Vanessa."
"jerry"," Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her 
              to go away for a couple of days."
"george"," Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. 
              What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to 
              be with her seventy-two"
"elaine","  Hey, why don't you take 
              her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, 
              that really charming place with"
"george","  That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too 
              much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?"
"jerry"," You better find that grape before it mutates into another 
              life form.  There was once a mutant grape that terrorized 
              an entire town in the Texas"
"george","  Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting 
              it."
"elaine"," You're getting what?"
"george"," A stock."
"jerry"," What stock?"
"george"," Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?"
"jerry"," Maybe."
"jerry"," How high's it suppose to go?"
"george"," I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, 
              that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You 
              wanna do it?"
"jerry"," Boy.. I don't know."
"elaine"," I'd do it but I don't have any money."
"jerry"," What kind of company is it?"
"george"," It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for 
              televising opera."
"elaine"," Televising opera?"
"george"," Some sort of electronic thingy."
"jerry"," Well, how much are you going to invest?"
"george","  Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand."
"jerry"," Boy.."
"george"," C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. 
              It's gone up three points since I've been watching it."
"jerry"," What if I lose it?"
"george"," C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. 
              Come on, come on. We're in it together."
"jerry","  All right -- twenty-five hundred."
"george"," That's it."
"george","  Check the raiser."
"jerry"," My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich."
"elaine"," Tuna?"
"jerry"," Oh, the dolphin thing?"
"elaine"," They're dying in the nets."
"jerry"," Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on 
              tuna."
"elaine"," Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your 
              daily routine?"
"jerry"," Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the 
              time. I'm always waving everybody in. ""Go ahead, go ahead, 
              go ahead."" ..Alright.. alright. I'll have"
"elaine"," And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine 
              on the side and a cup of coffee."
"george"," I'll have the tuna."
"jerry"," I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined 
              that movie for me."
"jerry"," What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. 
              Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond 
              that, I'm risking a punch in the"
"jerry"," Have you thought any more about that trip?"
"jerry"," You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont."
"jerry"," It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting 
              the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months 
              from now we accomplish"
"jerry"," Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased 
              call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get 
              a lot better in Phase Two."
"jerry"," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"
"jerry"," Oh, big fighting marlin."
"jerry"," I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they 
              have, uh, different.. sources."
"jerry"," Is that my paper?"
"kramer"," Bad news, my friend."
"jerry"," What? What news?"
"kramer"," Sendrax."
"jerry"," Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!"
"kramer"," Two and a half points."
"jerry"," Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that.  
              That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half 
              my money!"
"kramer"," Hey, I told ya."
"jerry","  Yeah, you told me."
"kramer"," It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win."
"jerry","  There's one thing I 
              don't understand. Why does it please you?  George Costanza, 
              please."
"kramer"," Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to  get 
              rid of that stock, now!"
"jerry","  George, what's going on?!"
"kramer"," Sell it, just say I'm selling!"
"jerry","  Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half 
              my money's gone.. Well, call me right back.  Nobody can 
              reach Wilkinson. He"
"kramer"," You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. 
              And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
"jerry"," Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?"
"kramer"," Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting 
              coming up."
"jerry"," Okay."
"kramer"," You just  tear it off, and you got a new one 
              right here. Then you're gone."
"jerry"," You're gone alright."
"kramer","  Hey, where.. where are you going? You 
              gonna take a trip? The map.. what.."
"jerry"," Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days."
"kramer"," Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming 
              over this weekend."
"jerry"," What friends?"
"kramer"," Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert."
"kramer"," Do you mind if they use your bed?  
              'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, 
              they're anarchists."
"jerry"," George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, 
              what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. 
               Wilkinson, the guy"
"jerry"," So you don't know what's wrong with him?"
"george"," All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital."
"jerry"," Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?"
"george"," Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. 
              He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all."
"jerry"," Well, this is it. I'm selling."
"george"," Just give it a little more time."
"jerry"," I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous 
              wreck. I""m not cut out for investing."
"george"," Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there."
"jerry"," Where?"
"george"," To the hospital."
"jerry"," The hospital?"
"george"," I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?"
"jerry"," Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy."
"george"," So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and 
              I'll work my way around to it."
"jerry"," What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you 
              gonna do?  ""How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? 
               By the"
"george"," Maybe he's resting."
"jerry"," Who goes to the hospital to rest?"
"george"," What are you, a doctor?"
"jerry"," Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?"
"george"," Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you 
              hear from me."
"jerry"," Alright."
"george","  Boy, I have to get to 
              a bathroom."
"jerry"," Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely 
              shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it."
"jerry"," What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of 
              this shirt?!"
"jerry"," I can't find the receipt."
"jerry"," Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had 
              the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do 
              with this?!"
"jerry"," What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this 
              tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! 
              In fact, forget the money. I don't even"
"jerry"," No.. dry-cleaned."
"jerry","  You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just 
              tell me that you shrunk it!"
"jerry"," I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I 
              can say to the dry cleaner, ""Well, it's ruined."" And of 
              course, the dry cleaner can respond, ""It's not"
"jerry"," Bless you."
"elaine"," Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, 
              anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. 
              My Uncle Pete showers"
"jerry"," So what are you gonna do?"
"elaine"," I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of 
              course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do 
              you think a hit man would charge to"
"jerry"," Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks 
              a cat?"
"elaine"," What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?"
"jerry"," I'm no cat killer."
"elaine"," How about we go over there right now and we shave them?"
"jerry"," I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back 
              from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely 
              go."
"elaine"," He actually wen to the hospital?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Oh man, he's nuts."
"jerry"," Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats.  I know, I know. It's down again."
"kramer"," How much are you down altogether?"
"jerry"," I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars."
"kramer"," Wow."
"jerry"," You don't have to say ""Wow."" I know it's ""Wow."" 
              And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?"
"jerry"," It's George. "
"kramer"," Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. 
              Take a look at this."
"jerry"," I really don't need to look."
"kramer"," What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me."
"jerry"," Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger 
              leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up."
"kramer"," I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. "
"jerry"," What? What? Did you go down there?  Did he 
              tell you what's gonna happen?  
              How long were you there?"
"george"," Fifteen seconds."
"jerry"," You told him you knew Simons?"
"george"," Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the 
              parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell 
              you one thing.. I don't know"
"jerry"," Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want 
              to think about this. I'm selling."
"elaine"," Didn't work, huh?"
"george","  Not quite."
"elaine"," Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?"
"george"," I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship."
"jerry"," So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount 
              now."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, right.  Oh God. Get me out of here. 
              What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still 
              got another day! I've got"
"jerry"," Well, that's good.  Well, the drive home should 
              be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. 
              I don't care. "
"jerry"," So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the 
              hot and cold - charming?"
"jerry"," Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?"
"jerry"," We cold play ""Sorry!"" We cold play ""Steal 
              the Old Man's Bundle.""  Maybe I can get an extension 
              cord and hang myself.  What"
"jerry"," No, what? What kind is it?"
"jerry","  Yeah, that's normal.  
              Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?"
"jerry"," I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want 
              to check it out.  Six points. It's up six points!"
"jerry"," You did not tell me not to sell."
"jerry"," Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody 
              knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!"
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," No, what? 'That's probably why..'"
"jerry","  So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine 
              hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the 
              name of that purfume.."
"george"," Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?"
"jerry"," I'm good, thanks."
"george"," Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of."
"elaine"," I'm kinda full."
"george"," So don't finish it."
"jerry","  She's full.  So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did 
              you clear on your little trasaction"
"george"," I don't like to discuss figures."
"jerry"," How much?"
"george"," I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get 
              out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson 
              cleaned up."
"jerry"," So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?"
"george"," No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly 
              from a nose job."
"jerry"," Is taht still from the cats?"
"elaine"," No, I just have a cold."
"jerry"," So, what ever happened with that?"
"elaine"," I gave him an ultimatum. "
"george"," He chose the cats?"
"elaine"," They're very clean animals."
"jerry"," I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat."
"elaine"," Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume."
"george"," I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad 
              you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super 
              speed and reverse time."
"elaine"," Superman can go back in time?"
"jerry"," We went over that."
"george"," Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out 
              of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort 
              of robot butcher."
"jerry"," A robot butcher?"
"jerry"," I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have 
              your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna 
              let the money relax. You"
"jerry"," I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this 
              type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never 
              quite sure, ""Is this the best lane for"
"george"," She can't kill me right?!"
"jerry"," No, of course not."
"george"," People break up all the time."
"jerry"," Everyday."
"george"," It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love 
              her. I tried to love her. I couldn't."
"jerry"," You tried."
"george"," I kept looking at her face. I'd go ""C'mon, love her. 
              Love her!"""
"jerry"," Did you tell her you loved her?"
"george"," Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell 
              me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go ""Oh, 
              really?"" or ""Boy, that's, that's"
"jerry"," You're a human being."
"george"," And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. 
              She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do 
              that to someone."
"jerry"," You're too nice a guy."
"george"," I am. I'm a nice guy..  And she seduced me! 
              We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the 
              chair - I get up to go to the"
"jerry"," You're flesh and blood."
"george"," I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, 
              I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it 
              would only get me in deeper. But"
"jerry"," I told you when I met her.."
"george"," My back is killing me."
"jerry"," You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best."
"george"," Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best."
"jerry"," I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together."
"george"," Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break 
              up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach 
              for these things."
"jerry"," You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right 
              off!"
"elaine"," Hi."
"jerry"," Hi."
"elaine"," Hey, what are you doing?"
"george"," I'm letting you in."
"elaine"," Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left 
              out of the conversation."
"george"," No, you won't."
"elaine"," Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of 
              the seat."
"george"," Okay.."
"elaine"," Why can't you sit in the middle?"
"george"," Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl."
"elaine"," I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little 
              homophobic, aren't you?"
"george"," Is it that obvious?"
"elaine"," Hello, Jerry."
"jerry"," Hello."
"elaine"," Did you get a haircut?"
"jerry"," No, shower. So, where are we eating?"
"elaine"," Tell me if you think this is strange There's this guy 
              who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years 
              ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or"
"george","  ""You know, I'd go from nods 
              to nothing.."""
"elaine"," And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. 
              I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing."
"jerry"," A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and 
              then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened 
              to The Blob."
"george"," I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. 
              Confront him."
"elaine"," Really?"
"george"," Yes."
"elaine"," You would do that?"
"george"," If I was a different person."
"jerry"," Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. 
              Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if 
              I dialed wrong or if.."
"kramer"," Come on up."
"jerry","  Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered 
              me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance 
              calls I made to you why"
"kramer"," Taste this."
"jerry"," No, I just had a sandwich."
"kramer"," No, taste it. Taste it."
"jerry"," I don't want cantaloupe now."
"kramer"," You've never had cantaloupe like this before."
"jerry"," I only eat cantaloupe at certain times."
"kramer"," Jerry. This is great cantaloupe."
"jerry"," Alright.. "
"kramer"," Ah, huh. It's good?"
"jerry"," It's very good."
"kramer"," Good, huh?"
"jerry"," Good."
"kramer"," I got it at Joe's."
"jerry"," Uh-Huh."
"kramer"," Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than 
              what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't 
              go to Joe's."
"jerry"," It's too far."
"kramer"," It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart.."
"jerry"," I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? 
              A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?"
"kramer"," See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he 
              takes it right back."
"jerry"," I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going 
              in."
"george"," I'm outta there. I did it! It's over."
"jerry"," You did it? What happened?"
"george"," I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's 
              near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen."""
"jerry"," Ah ha."
"george"," I said, ""Listen Marlene,"" and then the next thing 
              I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of 
              me going ""You're doing it! You're doing"
"jerry"," See, it's never as bad as you imagine."
"kramer"," I liked Marlene. What's her number?"
"george"," No, I, I don't think so."
"jerry"," Could you stop that smacking?"
"kramer"," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
"george"," Oh no, thank you."
"kramer"," It's the best cantaloupe I ever had."
"george"," No, really. No, no, thanks."
"kramer"," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is."
"jerry"," It's very good cantaloupe.  So that's 
              it? You're out?"
"george"," Except for one small problem. I left some books in her 
              apartment."
"jerry"," So, go get them."
"george"," Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward 
              and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could 
              happen, I'd be right back"
"jerry"," So forget about the books. Did you read them?"
"george"," Well, yeah."
"jerry"," What do you need them for?"
"george"," I don't know. They're books."
"jerry"," What is this obsession people have with books? They put 
              them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it 
              for after you read it?"
"george"," They're MY books."
"jerry"," So you want me to get those books? Is that it?"
"jerry"," So what'd you do?"
"jerry"," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a 
              guess."
"jerry"," No."
"jerry","  I don't know how this happened."
"george"," Jerry, it's not my fault."
"jerry"," No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. 
              Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great 
              thing? When you read"
"george"," That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages 
              where she uses up the whole machine?"
"jerry"," Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, ""Hello, Jerry?"" 
              and I'll go ""Oh, hi Marlene."" And then it's ""Jerry.."""
"george"," What about getting off the phone?"
"jerry"," Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in 
              the conversation where you can go, ""Alright, then.. "" 
              You know, it just goes on and on and on with"
"george"," Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She 
              is sexy though. Don't you think?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Yes, she is."
"george"," Yeah."
"george","  Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have 
              to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I?  I better take this. I"
"jerry"," Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 
              'Cause it says ""Waiting room."" There's no chance of not 
              waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting"
"jerry"," So, how was it?"
"george"," I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. 
               Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks."
"jerry"," Well, it's a first visit."
"george"," What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in 
              there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only 
              paying half."
"jerry"," You can't do that."
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says."
"george"," Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say."
"jerry"," No, I'm fine."
"jerry"," Yeah, I know."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Good night."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," I got it! This time, I got it!"
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Hips! See, it's all hips."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"kramer"," You gotta come through with the hips first. "
"jerry"," That is out there."
"kramer"," Joe's?"
"jerry"," No, supermarket."
"kramer"," Well, is it good?"
"jerry"," It's okay."
"kramer"," Let me taste it.  See, that 
              stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back."
"jerry"," I'm not taking it back."
"kramer"," Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there."
"jerry"," I don't care about it."
"kramer"," Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be 
              taken out of circulation."
"jerry"," Alright. Take it back."
"jerry","  Leave a message, I'll call you 
              back."
"kramer"," Well?"
"jerry"," Marlene"
"kramer","  Oh. Oh, Marlene."
"jerry"," Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a 
              little bit in the car."
"kramer"," I thought you were trying to get rid of her?"
"jerry"," I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized."
"kramer"," Does George know?"
"jerry"," No, he'd go nuts."
"kramer"," Yeah, no kidding."
"jerry"," I feel terrible.  I mean, I've seen her a 
              couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. 
              I've just got this like,"
"kramer"," Woah, psycho-sexual."
"jerry"," I don't know how I'm going to tell him."
"kramer"," Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George 
              want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?"
"jerry"," It's partially you, yeah."
"kramer"," You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone 
              else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know."
"jerry"," Well, he can't kill me, right?"
"kramer"," You're a human being."
"jerry"," I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started 
              it."
"kramer"," You're flesh and blood."
"jerry"," I'm a nice guy."
"elaine"," Hi. "
"jerry"," Oh, my little airplane lamp."
"elaine"," You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? 
              That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones."
"jerry"," Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the 
              offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
"elaine"," Unless you're married to a dictator.."
"jerry"," Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people."
"elaine"," Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's 
              going to offer me some cantaloupe."
"kramer"," Nope. No good."
"jerry"," Well, you know what they say Luck in love, Unlucky with 
              fruit."
"kramer"," Well, I'm taking this back. "
"elaine"," So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning."
"jerry"," Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?"
"elaine"," Yep."
"jerry"," You talked to him?"
"elaine"," Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was 
              just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no. 
              Do not be afraid of this man."""
"jerry"," Right."
"elaine"," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. 
              And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow 
              as if he's really trying to figure it"
"jerry"," ""You little phony""?"
"elaine"," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh, 
              yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."" And I said, 
              ""Well, how do you go from that to"
"jerry"," Amazing."
"elaine"," And he says, he says, ""Look, I just didn't want to 
              say hello anymore, alright?"" And I said, ""Fine. Fine I 
              didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I"
"jerry"," You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. 
              In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something 
              right now."
"elaine"," This cantaloupe stinks. "
"george"," I don't care."
"jerry"," You're kidding."
"george"," No, I don't care."
"jerry"," You mean that?"
"george"," Absolutely."
"jerry"," You don't care?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," How could you not care?"
"george"," I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to 
              hear it."
"jerry"," I thought you'd be upset."
"george"," I guess I should be but I'm not."
"jerry"," Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?"
"george"," No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's 
              very sexy."
"jerry"," That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy."
"george"," I know, I know."
"jerry"," So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?"
"george"," See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. 
              She's too crazy for me."
"jerry"," Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking 
              about her."
"george"," I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better 
              in my whole life."
"jerry"," Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me 
              back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of 
              your bill."
"george","  You paid that crook?!"
"jerry"," I had to."
"george"," He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you 
              to do that?"
"jerry"," It was embarrassing to me."
"george"," I was trying to make a point."
"jerry"," Why don't you make a point with your own doctor?  What's wrong?"
"george","  I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! 
              What do I do? What can happen?"
"jerry"," ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?"
"jerry"," Really? I thought.."
"jerry"," I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been 
              acting."
"jerry"," Of course I want to talk about it."
"jerry"," Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?"
"jerry"," My act? What does that have to do with anything?"
"jerry"," I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't 
              like my act, so that's it?"
"jerry"," You're a cashier!"
"jerry"," You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They 
              were terrible."
"jerry"," I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend."
"jerry"," Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they 
              don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which 
              is why we make up the phony"
"jerry"," My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. 
              They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, 
              and that's the law. You know"
"jerry","  Would you make this thing 
              lower! I can hear it on the street! "
"jerry"," We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was 
              a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on 
              a fly! We'll be in the championship"
"jerry"," Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course."
"jerry"," Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. 
              He knows what he's doing."
"jerry"," First of all, I made plans with Elaine."
"jerry"," I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? 
              I mean, I've met them three times in my life."
"jerry"," If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's 
              always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because 
              so many people have left in the"
"jerry"," Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid 
              works for the Parks Department."
"kramer"," Morty, are you coming in?"
"kramer","  Hey, how'd you do?"
"jerry"," We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday.."
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"jerry","  What is this about?"
"kramer"," I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. 
              You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle."
"jerry"," What are you doing?"
"kramer"," Levels."
"jerry"," Levels?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And 
              I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll 
              all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You"
"jerry"," You drew up plans for this?"
"kramer"," No, no. It's all in my head."
"kramer"," Oh, I'll be comfortable."
"jerry"," When do you intend to do this?"
"kramer"," Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month."
"jerry"," You're doing this yourself?"
"kramer"," It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?"
"jerry"," Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that 
              you can't, and I'm positive that you won't."
"kramer"," Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is 
              the lumber."
"jerry"," I don't see it happening."
"kramer"," Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even 
              bet you."
"jerry"," Seriously?"
"kramer"," A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of 
              the month."
"jerry"," I'll give you a year."
"kramer"," No, no, no. End of the month."
"jerry"," It's a bet. "
"jerry"," Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?"
"elaine"," No, no. I'm fine."
"jerry"," Yeah, Uncle Leo."
"jerry"," Right. For reducing the pond scum?"
"jerry"," Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible 
              foliage tour."
"jerry"," Mickey Mantle?"
"elaine","  Jerry, 
              Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!"
"jerry","  These peas are bursting with country-fresh 
              flavor."
"elaine"," Mmm.. phenomenal peas.."
"jerry"," Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going."
"elaine"," I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting."
"jerry"," Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles 
              swell up, and I can't dance."
"jerry"," Horses. They're like big riding dogs."
"elaine"," What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? 
              And those kids who had their own ponies.."
"jerry"," I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that 
              ever had a pony when they were growing up."
"jerry"," ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se."
"jerry"," Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting.."
"jerry"," Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't 
              love a person that had a pony?"
"jerry"," No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in 
              Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.."
"jerry"," I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had 
              a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you 
              know what the odds are on"
"jerry"," I'll drive you to the airport."
"jerry"," I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper 
              on the trip."
"jerry"," Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine 
              too. She feels terrible."
"jerry"," Maybe I will."
"kramer"," Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye.  
              ..Need any help with those?"
"kramer"," Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it."
"jerry","  Really? What a shock."
"jerry"," Take care."
"jerry"," Bye, Dad. Take it easy."
"kramer"," Yeah. So long, Morty. "
"jerry"," So, when do I get my dinner?"
"kramer"," There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it."
"jerry"," Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet."
"kramer"," There's not bet if I' not doing it."
"jerry"," That's the bet! That you're not doing it!"
"kramer"," Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it."
"jerry"," We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would 
              be done."
"kramer"," And it could be done."
"jerry"," Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! 
              But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is 
              the levels."
"kramer"," But I don't want the levels!"
"jerry"," That's the bet!  Hello? ..No, 
              oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe 
              I can still catch them. (Jerry"
"jerry"," Uncle Leo."
"jerry"," I don't know. He said he'd call back."
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," You don't think.. What? The pony remark?"
"jerry"," You don't think that I killed her?"
"jerry"," It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a 
              pony!"
"jerry"," The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. 
               That's probably Uncle Leo."
"jerry"," Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?"
"jerry"," I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship."
"jerry"," I didn't even know the woman."
"jerry"," I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name."
"jerry"," I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I 
              want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything."
"jerry"," I don't know what to do."
"jerry"," We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that 
              we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I 
              think if you can't stretch out and"
"elaine"," I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. 
              What time's your game?"
"jerry"," Two Forty-Five."
"elaine"," And what time's the funeral?"
"jerry"," Two o' clock."
"elaine"," How long does a funeral take?"
"jerry"," Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, 
              even Oswald took forty-five minutes."
"elaine"," So you cna't do both?"
"jerry"," You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some 
              mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go 
              to my funeral. I would"
"elaine"," How can you even consider not going?"
"george"," You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances 
              in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's 
              it gonna happen? I"
"elaine"," You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality 
              and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that."
"george"," They always make me take stock of my life and how I've 
              pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting 
              it."
"jerry"," I know, and then you say to yourself, ""From this moment 
              on, I'm not going to waste any more of it."" But then you go, 
              ""How? What can I do that's not"
"elaine"," Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't 
              you hae coffee with people?"
"george"," You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. 
              We need you. You're hitting everything."
"elaine"," He has to go. He may have killed her."
"jerry"," Me? What about you? You brought up the pony."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one."
"george","  Who's going to play left field?"
"jerry"," Bender."
"george"," Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see 
              what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think 
              dead peole care who's at the"
"elaine"," Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?"
"george"," If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions 
              and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think 
              she's going to want to hang"
"elaine"," George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other 
              dimensions."
"george"," You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's 
              not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental."
"jerry"," Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix."
"elaine"," Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?"
"jerry"," I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War 
              II. The rent's three hundred a month."
"elaine"," Three hundred a month? Oh my God."
"jerry","  Well, the game's starting just about 
              now."
"jerry","  I just wanted to say how sorry I was.."
"jerry","  Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am 
              abou tthe other night."
"elaine"," Oh, me too."
"elaine"," So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?"
"elaine"," Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with 
              your apartment?"
"elaine"," Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what 
              about that big apartment on West End Avenue?"
"elaine"," Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?"
"elaine"," I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, 
              and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure 
              that nothing happens to it."
"elaine","  Oh, Jeffrey."
"jerry","  You know Jeffery?"
"elaine"," Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department."
"jerry","  It's raining? It's raining. The game 
              will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow."
"george"," Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of."
"jerry"," It's never happend to me before."
"elaine"," I remember saying to myself, ""Why is Jerry so far 
              off the base?"""
"jerry"," I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life."
"george"," And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the 
              pop fly?"
"jerry"," I thought there were two outs."
"elaine"," I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought 
              maybe they had changed the rules or something."
"jerry"," It was the single worst moment of my life."
"george"," What about Sharon Besser?"
"jerry"," Oh, well, of course. 1973."
"elaine"," Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?"
"jerry"," Wonder about what?"
"elaine"," You know.. the spirit world."
"jerry"," You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex 
              on me?"
"elaine"," I never saw anyone play like that."
"jerry"," But I went ot the funeral."
"elaine"," Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her."
"george"," Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting 
              another galaxy that day."
"jerry"," Don't you think she would've heard I was there?"
"george"," Not necessarily. "
"jerry"," Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?"
"jerry"," What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do 
              we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides 
              the pony ride. Why"
"jerry"," I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking 
              them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up 
              with little outfits for myself. I think"
"jerry"," I think I've seen enough."
"elaine"," The back? They never find anything in the back. If they 
              had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front."
"jerry"," Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call 
              it, ""Just Back."" All back. No front. You walk in the front, 
              you're immediately in the back. (Picks"
"jerry","  Her father wrote that."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," I'm not so sure he wants one.  Hey, don't 
              forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, 
              eight o' clock."
"jerry"," ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean.."
"elaine"," What? What, you don't want to go now?"
"jerry"," No, I'll go. I'm going."
"elaine"," No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't 
              seen my father in a while and.. you know."
"jerry"," I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a 
              great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits."
"elaine"," So, that's why we're not togeter anymore."
"jerry","  What is this?  This is 
              beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right."
"elaine"," Try it on.  Wow, this is soft suede."
"jerry"," This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. 
               How much is it?"
"elaine","  Oh my God."
"jerry"," Bad?  ..Very bad?"
"elaine"," You have no idea."
"jerry"," I have some idea."
"elaine"," No idea."
"jerry"," I've got a ballpark."
"elaine"," There is no park and the team has relocated."
"jerry","  ..That is high."
"elaine"," Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though."
"jerry","  What's with the pink 
              lining and the candy stripes?"
"elaine"," Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed."
"jerry"," Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual 
              voices now, you know. ""What about the money?"" ""What's 
              money?"""
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey. New jacket?"
"jerry"," What do you think?"
"kramer"," It's beautiful."
"jerry"," Is it me?"
"kramer"," That's definitely you."
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," That's more you than you've ever been.  What is with the pink lining?"
"jerry"," I don't know. It's got a pink lining."
"kramer"," Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?"
"jerry"," I paid what it costs."
"kramer"," How much?"
"jerry"," What's the difference?"
"kramer"," What, you're not gonna tell me?"
"jerry"," I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing."
"kramer"," Over three hundred?"
"jerry"," Yes, but let's just stop it right there."
"kramer"," It's over four hundred?"
"jerry"," Really, I'm not answering anymore."
"kramer"," Is it over four hundred?"
"jerry"," Would you?"
"kramer","  Woah, Nelson!"
"jerry"," I know, I know."
"kramer","  What are you gonna do with 
              the leather one?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Well, are you gonna wear it?"
"jerry"," Maybe."
"kramer","  You're not going to wear 
              this."
"jerry"," Do you want it?"
"kramer"," Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket."
"jerry","  ..Okay, take 
              it."

"george"," Oh, Schumann. Of course."
"jerry","  He went crazy from one note. He 
              couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating

"george"," ""Master of the house, keeper of the inn..""  This is huge!"
"jerry"," Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When 
              I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence.

"jerry"," I know."
"george"," And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to 
              ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me 
              when you feel comfortable.. So"
"kramer"," Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?"
"jerry"," Well, what kind of solid?"
"kramer"," I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's 
              double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds."
"jerry"," Birds?"
"kramer"," Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away 
              on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves."
"jerry"," So take a cab."
"kramer"," They won't take a cage full of birds."

              Where are they?"
"george"," Maybe he didn't show up."
"jerry"," What, you don't want to do this?"
"george"," I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life 
              where I wanted the other guy to show up."
"george","  Wait a 
              second, is that him?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I think it is.  Where's Elaine?"
"george"," I'm nervous."
"jerry"," Excuse me.. Mister Benes?"
"jerry"," I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George."
"george","  It's a great thrill 
              to meet you, Sir."
"jerry"," Sure."
"jerry","  I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes."
"george"," And, I'll have a club soda with no ice."

              pretty punctual.  ..Don't you find that, George?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's 
              late."
"george"," I guess today she's late."
"jerry"," It appears that way."
"george"," Yep."
"jerry"," Yep."
"george","  I know, I know, that's what they said."
"george"," The weather guy, Dr. Waldo."
"george"," No, of course not. I didn't.."
"george","  Oh, he's the comedian."
"jerry"," I'm just a regular person."
"george"," No, no. He's just being modest."
"jerry"," Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
              I'll be right back."
"george"," I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. 
              I thought it was just brilliant."
"george"," Maybe some parts."
"george"," The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have 
              to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. "
"george"," Thank you for leaving me alone with him!"

"george"," Well, let's just leave."
"jerry"," Elaine'll kill me."
"george"," Where is she?"
"jerry"," She's gotta be here soon."
"george"," How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more 
              minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy 
              scares me."
"jerry"," The waiter was trembling."
"george"," If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with 
              him alone."
"jerry"," How are we gonna get out of it?"
"george"," We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home."
"jerry"," Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe."
"george"," I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have 
              the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that."
"jerry"," All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because 
              they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life,

"george"," Come on, let's go!"
"jerry"," What about Elaine?"
"george"," To hell with Elaine!"
"jerry"," She'll be furious."
"george"," We're dying here!"
"jerry"," That's her! She's here!"
"elaine"," I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?"
"george","  He's in the bathroom."
"jerry"," Where have you been?!"
"elaine"," Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls 
              me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick 
              up these birds.."
"jerry"," Oh, you didn't.."
"elaine"," Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am 
              sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. 
              Then a cop comes by, tells me"
"jerry","  Great."
"george"," Couldn't be better."
"elaine"," Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable."
"jerry"," Oh, no, no."
"george"," Get outta here.."
"elaine"," Man, Kramer! I could kill him."
"jerry"," I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved 
              with Kramer."
"elaine"," He said he'd give me a lift."
"jerry"," Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what 
              it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?"
"george"," Where do you come up with this stuff?"
"elaine"," Oh, Hi, Dad."
"elaine"," No one."
"elaine"," Fine."
"elaine"," Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I 
              told you ten times."
"george"," ""Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready 
              with a handshake and an open.."""
"elaine"," Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful."
"jerry","  Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can 
              it?"
"george"," I wouldn't think so."
"jerry"," What should I do?  We're taking a cab, aren't 
              we?"
"george","  Why don't you just turn it inside out?"
"jerry"," Inside out! Great."
"jerry"," Oh, I turned my jacket inside out."
"jerry","  Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get 
              ruined."
"george"," It's only a few blocks."
"jerry","  Elaine?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Come on up."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," I've gotta feed the birds."
"jerry"," So?.."
"kramer"," You got any of those mini Ritzes?"
"jerry"," I can't believe I do."
"kramer"," Yeah! ..Well, are you going out?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Hey, where's your new jacket?  What? (Kramer 
              enters the bathroom,"
"jerry"," I was out in the snow last night."
"kramer"," Don't youk now what that does to suede?"
"jerry"," I have an idea.  We can make the nine-thirty 
              at Cinema III."
"elaine"," Okay..  Hello.  Listen, thanks again 
              for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time."
"jerry"," Is he still in town?"
"elaine"," No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight."
"kramer","  So, uh.. what are you 
              gonna do with that one now?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Well?.."
"elaine","  I didn't want to tell you this, but usually 
              he hates everyone."
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," You gonna throw this out?"
"jerry"," Well, I can't wear it."
"elaine","  Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded 
              him of somebody he knew in Korea."
"kramer"," Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could 
              take it."
"jerry"," Yeah, go ahead, take it."
"elaine"," Dad thinks George is gay."
"jerry"," Oh, because of all that singing?"
"elaine"," No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay."
"kramer"," Hey, see, I like it like this. "
"elaine","  Isnt' that..? 
               Oh, is this fromt he snow last night?  
              Ugh.. you know what you"
"jerry"," I'll try and remember that."
"kramer","  Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too."
"jerry","  Yeah, too bad."
"kramer"," I'm gonna have to do something about this lining."
"jerry"," I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture 
              ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time? 
              I don't understand it."
"george"," So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing 
              there, "
"jerry"," So you didn't ask?"
"george"," No, I froze."
"jerry","  Counter."
"george"," Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the 
              office, "
"jerry"," He said wuss? "
"george"," Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it."
"jerry"," So you called. "
"george"," Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating 
              an apple, "
"jerry"," Yeah, like a farm boy."
"george"," Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives 
              me an "
"jerry"," Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful."
"george"," Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there."
"jerry"," Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic 
            "
"george"," So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before 
              I ask them "
"jerry"," And?"
"george"," She bought."
"jerry"," Great day in the morning."
"george"," Then I got off the phone right away."
"jerry"," Sure, it's like robbing a bank you don't loiter around 
              in front of "
"george"," It's amazing we, we both have dates on the same night. 
              I can't "
"george"," I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs 
              of "

              buying "

              you try "
"jerry"," Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?"
"george"," Yeah. We should do this again."
"george"," Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it 
              keeps me up."
"george"," OK."
"george"," Yeah, take it easy."
"jerry"," You're welcome."
"jerry"," Oh, that's OK."
"jerry"," OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're 
              looking "
"george"," Take it easy, huh, take it easy."
"jerry"," I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could 
              do is "
"jerry"," Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - 
              you wanna "
"jerry","  Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, 
              Donna? I "
"jerry"," Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial. 
            "
"jerry"," You like that commercial?"
"jerry"," Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all 
              standing "
"jerry"," What could you possibly like about that?"
"jerry"," Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, 
              and I "
"jerry","  Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even 
              if "
"jerry"," But they're talking about nothing."
"jerry"," I know the point."
"jerry"," I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, 
              pants, "
"jerry"," I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go 
              out with "
"elaine"," I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom 
              clean "
"jerry"," No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?"
"elaine"," Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed 
              his "
"elaine"," Hi."
"jerry"," You're still thinking about this?"
"george","  She invites me up at twelve o 
              clock at "
"jerry"," She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee."
"george"," She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex."
"elaine"," Maybe coffee was coffee."
"george"," Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve 
              o clock at "
"elaine"," Well some people drink coffee that late."
"george"," Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour 
              missile "
"elaine"," It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good 
              time. I "
"george"," I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday 
              call."
"elaine"," Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day."
"george"," Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, 
              not a guy who "
"elaine"," All she'll think is that you like her."
"george"," Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she 
              doesn't like "
"elaine"," I don't know what your parents did to you."
"kramer"," Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. 
              Alright, "
"jerry"," I don't think so."
"kramer"," It's funny."
"elaine"," It is funny."
"kramer"," That's as good as anything you do."
"george"," Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on."
"jerry"," Why do we have to leave?"
"george"," Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. 
              Come "
"elaine"," Oh, see, this is the problem."
"jerry"," You're kicking me out of my house?"
"george"," Yes."
"elaine"," Don't forget."
"george"," Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?"
"jerry"," Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples."
"george"," Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The 
              guy that "
"jerry"," I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. 
              What's the "
"george"," Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm 
              dead, "
"jerry"," What did you say?"
"george"," I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum 
              and "
"jerry"," After one date you try and improvise on her machine?"
"george"," Now I'm in the worst position of all."
"elaine"," Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's 
              machine, "
"george"," He did that?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," Somebody did that?"
"jerry"," She'll call you back. You're overreacting."
"jerry"," Not once."
"jerry"," I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life 
              ever."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"jerry"," Yes, I'm lactose intolerant."
"jerry"," I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. 
              Uhm, "
"george"," Wait till you hear this . Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, 
              I "
"george"," I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come 
              back."
"george"," You sure?"
"george"," OK."
"george"," Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!"
"george"," No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking 
              about "
"jerry"," What?  What did, what did you say?"
"george"," Say? What? Nothing, I.. "
"jerry"," Well, so what if I said that?"
"jerry"," No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to 
              tell you."
"george","  Why did you have to get me in trouble?"
"george"," Boy oh boy."
"jerry"," I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So 
              what?"
"jerry"," Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there."
"jerry"," Oh, Kramer, this is Donna."
"george"," Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on ."
"george"," Come on!"
"jerry"," Donna, really, you're making too much of this."
"jerry"," Please, Donna."
"george"," I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault."
"jerry"," Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway."
"jerry"," I'll tell you later. "
"george"," You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman."
"george"," OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she 
              doesn't call "
"jerry"," You said that?"
"george"," I lost it."
"jerry"," I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you 
              back."
"george"," She did. Today."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons 
              since "
"jerry"," So she didn't get the messages."
"george"," Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't 
              wait to "
"jerry"," But what about the messages?"
"jerry"," Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?"
"george"," I'll meet her outside the building."
"jerry"," But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's 
              going right "
"george"," Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who 
              am I "
"jerry"," There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right 
              out."
"george"," You do it for me."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," Come on, it'll be so much easier."
"jerry"," How you gonna get me up there?"
"george"," I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride 
              uptown."
"jerry"," And who makes the switch?"
"george"," You do."
"jerry"," I do."
"george"," I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy."
"jerry"," I can't get involved in this."
"george"," I think I may be in love with this woman."
"jerry"," What if she sees me?"
"george"," Oh, you are such a wuss."
"jerry"," A wuss?"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Did you call me a wuss?"
"george"," Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen."
"jerry"," I got one problem you're keeping her busy in the other 
              room. Now, "
"george"," A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call 
              out 'Tippy "
"jerry"," 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so."
"george"," You don't like 'Tippy toe?'"
"jerry"," No 'Tippy toe.'"
"george"," Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing."
"jerry"," What song?"
"george"," Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'"
"jerry"," What is that?"
"george"," Oh, it's a lovely song.  How do you solve a problem 
              like "
"jerry"," Anything else?"
"george"," You pick it."
"jerry"," 'Lemon Tree'"
"george"," Peter, Paul and Mary."
"jerry"," No, Trini Lopez."
"george"," You got the tape?"
"jerry","  Standard. Micro."
"george"," How do you feel? Confident?"
"jerry"," Feel good."
"george"," You nervous?"
"jerry"," Not at all."
"george"," Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared 
              to "
"george"," Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed 
              to call you "
"george"," I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you."
"george"," Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into 
              him "
"jerry"," All the time."
"jerry"," Hi."
"george"," You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give 
              Jerry a "
"george"," Don't you wanna go upstairs first?"
"jerry"," You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
"george"," Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so..."
"george"," I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. 
              I think we "
"george"," Right, right."
"jerry"," Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long 
              trip."
"jerry"," Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away."
"george"," No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that 
              in medical "
"george"," Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now."
"george"," Please, this is very, very important. "
"george","  Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon 
              tree!"
"jerry"," Right. I am."
"george"," Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a 
              moment, if "
"jerry","  Hey you two. I'm ready to go."
"george","  Don't you find that strange?"
"jerry"," Yes."
"george"," Oh, uhhh..."
"jerry"," I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, 
        and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because 
        it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know 
        so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that 
        I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable 
        prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very 
        nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know 
        I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am 
        among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what 
        annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with 
        that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes 
        company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the 
        truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!"" 
        You turn it over, giant printing, ""Not even close!"" You open 
        it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, ""Even we cannot 
        believe how badly you've done in this contest."""
"jerry","  To the right. 
        "
"george"," That took awhile."
"jerry","  Don't get up."
"george"," I'd like to help, but my neck.."
"george"," So how long has it been in the basement?"
"jerry"," Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my 
        parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of 
        it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been 
        sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it.  Alright, 
        so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here."
"george"," What's in it?"
"jerry"," Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them."
"kramer","  You want these? Knee socks. You don't 
        wear knee socks."
"jerry"," No, go ahead.  Look at this place. 
        I can't wait to get it cleaned."
"george"," I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest."
"jerry"," No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend 
        goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it."
"george"," Students can't clean. It's anathema.  ..They 
        don't like it."
"jerry"," How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?"
"kramer"," Now this, I like."
"george"," Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this."
"kramer","  Wait, wait, wait.."
"george"," Let me just see it."
"kramer"," Come on.."
"george"," Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the 
        same!"
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue 
        on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and 
        I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"", 
        and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,"" 
        and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like 
        I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was 
        the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father 
        naked."
"kramer"," C'mon, George. I saw it first."
"george"," No, Kramer. I have to have this statue."
"kramer"," No, I got dibs!"
"george"," What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!"
"jerry","  Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't 
        you just settle it like mature adults?"
"kramer"," Potato man!"
"george"," No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink."
"kramer"," Okay.. start with me."
"george"," Yeah, good, good."
"jerry"," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. 
        Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you 
        kissed the girl behind the magazine..  And you are it! "
"kramer"," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, 
        oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it."
"george"," No, no, no, no.. I'm ""it"". I win."
"jerry"," No, he's it. He wins. ""It"" is good."
"kramer"," Do over - start with him."
"jerry"," No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks."
"kramer"," Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and 
        the shoes, and the hat."
"jerry"," Alright, c'mon. Let's go."
"kramer"," Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. "
"george","  I can't believe I won at Inka-dink."
"jerry"," Come on, let's go.  Aren't you gonna take it?"
"george"," No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick 
        it up later."
"kramer"," Oh, uh, well - okay. "
"jerry"," Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," The Inka-dink.. you were ""It""."
"george"," ""It""'s bad?"
"jerry"," ""It"" very bad."
"elaine"," You told them that?"
"elaine"," This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you."
"jerry","  So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much 
        longer. I've got a flight."
"elaine"," Oh, probably caught in traffic."
"jerry","  So what do you write, children's books?"
"jerry","  ..Alright."
"jerry","  I gotta get to the airport."
"jerry"," The toilet brush is under the sink.. "
"jerry"," I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because 
        there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, 
        you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm 
        really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."" 
        And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. 
        I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you 
        couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you 
        couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"""
"jerry"," He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of 
        the dishwashing liquid.  He cleaned out the bottom 
        of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this.  He 
        cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. 
        How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!"
"elaine"," There's no Rubber Man."
"jerry"," ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man 
        and Plastic Man."
"elaine"," I'm leaving."
"jerry"," Where are you going?"
"elaine"," To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript."
"jerry"," Wait. I'll go with you.  Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! "
"elaine","  So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! 
        I think because of your request.."
"jerry"," Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that 
        apartment."
"jerry","  Shouldn't you be out on a ledge 
        somewhere?"
"elaine"," Jerry? ..Jerry!"
"jerry","  What?"
"jerry","  I think that's the statue from my house. 
        That looks like the statue from my house!"
"elaine"," What statue?"
"jerry"," I had a statue!"
"elaine"," You have a statue? I never saw a statue."
"jerry"," My grandfather gave me a statue!"
"elaine"," Since when?"
"jerry"," What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This 
        guy ripped me off!"
"jerry"," I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!"
"elaine"," Do you realize what you're saying?"
"jerry"," Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of 
        my house!"
"elaine"," Are you sure?"
"jerry"," Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure."
"elaine"," Ninety-nine percent sure?!"
"elaine"," Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence."
"jerry"," Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, 
        he has the same exact statue in his apartment."
"elaine"," I never saw the statue."
"jerry"," I had a statue! What should I do?"
"elaine"," I don't know."
"jerry"," ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. "
"elaine"," Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me."
"jerry"," Don't worry..  Kramer! Kramer!.. It's 
        Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry 
        Seinfeld!.. "
"jerry"," Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right 
        in the pan. Okay, bye.  My mother.. She forgot how to make French 
        Toast. You know how mothers are."
"jerry"," My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot 
        down there in the summer. You ever been down there?"
"jerry"," ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial."
"elaine","  Oh, see you tomarrow morning."
"jerry"," No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. "
"jerry","  Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.  Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they 
        can do."
"kramer"," Let's go get him."
"jerry"," Yeah, right."
"george"," We can't just let him get away with this."
"jerry"," Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? 
        He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things 
        to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy."
"kramer"," You wanta go get him?"
"elaine"," Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it."
"george"," Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect 
        the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!"
"elaine"," George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?"
"george"," Who is this Rava?"
"kramer"," I say we get him."
"elaine"," No!"
"george"," Let me just call him."
"jerry"," I'll call him.  Hello, 
        Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King 
        of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one 
        with the blue lady?  Will you shut up?!  
        Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava 
        to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, 
        Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. "
"elaine","  Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it."
"george"," Oh, he stole it?"
"elaine"," C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. 
        What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?"
"george","  I thought you said one o' 
        clock."
"jerry"," Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his ""M.O."""
"george"," Remember, don't take any crap."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it."
"george"," I'll be right here."
"jerry","  That's comforting.. Shh. He's here.  
        Ray?"
"jerry"," ..Well, I didn't.."
"george","  I wonder why."
"jerry"," Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What are you talking about?"
"george","  What is he talking about.."
"jerry"," Yeah, me too."
"jerry"," Me."
"george","  Yeah, him."
"jerry"," Yeah. Me."
"george","  You already got it."
"jerry"," Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then 
        I saw it in your house."
"jerry"," What am I saying?"
"george","  Take a wild guess."
"george","  What a mind."
"jerry"," Well, I.."
"jerry"," I can't believe what I'm hearing."
"george","  I can't believe what I'm hearing."
"george","  A pawn shop?"
"jerry"," A pawn shop?"
"george","  And cleaning them out."
"jerry"," Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house."
"george","  Again with the Rava."
"jerry","  No, she's a little too cheery for me."
"jerry"," I know Finland. They're neutral."
"jerry"," No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times."
"george","  ""Oh, I find you so charming"" ..You wuss."
"jerry","  Did you call me a wuss?"
"jerry"," I said luss.. I'm at a luss.."
"jerry"," That's not necessary.  You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea."
"george","  Singapore?! Do you hear this?"
"jerry","  George."
"george"," I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!"
"george"," GUILTY!"
"george"," Oh, I'm crazy!"
"jerry","  George, george.."
"george"," Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. 
        I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record 
        of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!"
"george"," You mean alias."
"george"," Well, that was bound to happen!"
"jerry"," Hey, Ray."
"jerry"," How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? 
        It was like a brand-new nozzle!"
"elaine"," Nervous?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Right."
"elaine"," The book is great. Did you go out last night?"
"elaine"," They all are.."
"elaine"," I can't remember.."
"elaine"," Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. 
        I am not getting involved."
"elaine"," Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence."
"elaine"," Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and 
        it's in your apartment."
"elaine"," No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence."
"elaine"," A big coincidence."
"elaine"," No, that's a big coincidence."
"elaine"," No, there are degrees of coincidences."
"elaine"," Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?"
"george","  Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is 
        it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, 
        fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye.  She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me."
"kramer"," I'm not happy about this."
"elaine"," Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?"
"george"," There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's 
        made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."
"jerry"," Really?"
"george","  Sure. Why not?"
"elaine"," Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel 
        of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook."
"jerry"," Can't you talk to your boss?"
"elaine"," I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think 
        you're funny at all."
"kramer"," I'm not happy about this."
"jerry"," Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the 
        next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh 
        brand of justice.."
"george"," Yeah.. He'll have my parents!"
"kramer"," Police! Open up!"
"kramer"," Freeze, mother!"
"kramer"," Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em!  You're 
        in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. 
        and uh, uh.. murder."
"kramer"," Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!"
"kramer","  Is your name Ray?"
"kramer","  Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. "
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's 
        your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any 
        more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?"
"kramer"," Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. "
"jerry"," Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?"
"george"," Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Kramer, what did you do?"
"kramer"," Well, let's put it this way I didn't take him to People's Court."
"george"," I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders.  
        I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!"
"kramer"," Well, I'll think of something.. "
"jerry"," People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, 
        everybody has their own little personal security things - things that 
        they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You 
        go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's 
        gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? 
        I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the 
        toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move 
        on."
"george"," That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm 
              gone."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again 
              last"
"jerry"," Well, what'd you say?"
"kramer"," I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to 
              do this for years. I"
"jerry"," What's his problem?"
"kramer"," No job. No women."
"jerry"," He called the right guy."
"kramer"," What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him 
              to live"
"jerry"," All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
"kramer"," Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?"
"jerry"," Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers 
              in tune with"
"kramer"," How 'bout if I put a few things --"
"jerry"," Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --"
"kramer"," Well, you're going over there."
"jerry"," I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your 
              guys. You"
"kramer"," Have you ever met my guys?"
"jerry"," No. I can't say as I have."
"kramer"," Well!"
"jerry"," All right. Put 'em on top."
"kramer"," Ah!"
"jerry"," Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I 
              get it done"
"jerry"," Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines 
              are"
"george"," Guess what."
"jerry"," How did you know I was here?"
"george"," Kramer. Guess what."
"jerry"," I don't know."
"george"," I quit my job."
"jerry"," Get outta here."
"george"," I couldn't take it anymore."
"jerry"," What happened? Levitan?"
"george"," I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, 
              and then I"
"jerry"," You and your toilets."
"george"," I snapped! It was the last straw. "
"jerry"," So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something 
              else"
"george"," Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. "
"jerry"," So what are you gonna do?"
"george"," I like sports. I could do something in sports."
"jerry"," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?"
"george"," You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or 
              something."
"jerry"," Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. "
"george"," Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe 
              I could"
"jerry"," Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments."
"george"," What about that?"
"jerry"," Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and 
              people that"
"george"," Well, that's really not fair."
"jerry"," I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
"george"," Movies. I like to watch movies. "
"jerry"," Yeah. Yeah."
"george"," Do they pay people to watch movies?"
"jerry"," Projectionists."
"george"," That's true."
"jerry"," But you gotta know how to work the projector. "
"george"," Right."
"jerry"," And it's probably a union thing."
"george","  Those unions.  Okay. Sports,...movies. 
              What about a"
"jerry"," Talk show host. That's good."
"george"," I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. 
              Someone"
"jerry"," Really?"
"george"," Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where 
              do you"
"jerry"," Well, that's where it gets tricky. "
"george"," You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna 
              be a talk"
"jerry"," I wouldn't think so. "
"george"," It's all politics."
"jerry"," All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
"george"," This could have been a huge mistake."
"jerry"," Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this 
              through."
"george","  What should I do?"
"jerry"," Maybe you can just go back."
"george"," Go back?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Pretend like it never happened."
"george"," You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning 
              like it"
"jerry"," Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you 
              seriously. "
"george"," Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened."
"jerry"," Never happened."
"george"," I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?"
"jerry"," So what? You're entitled."
"george"," I'm emotional."
"jerry"," That's right. You're emotional."
"george"," Never happened."
"jerry"," Never happened."
"george"," How ya doin'?"
"george"," What? I work here."
"george"," What quit?  Who quit? "
"george"," Yeah. Good weekend."
"george"," Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor."
"george"," What? "
"george"," When?"
"george"," Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? 
              You"
"george"," Come on. Will you stop it."
"george"," Teasing."
"george"," I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're 
              serious"
"george"," "" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" 
              This is"
"jerry"," Well, so that's that."
"george"," No. That's not that."
"jerry"," That's not that?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," Well, if that's not that, what is that?"
"george"," I've got some plans. I got plans."
"jerry"," What kind of plans?"
"george"," What's the difference?"
"jerry"," You don't wanna tell me?"
"george"," I'm gonna slip him a mickey."
"jerry"," What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you 
              Peter"
"george"," You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. 
              He's been"
"jerry"," What if you destroy him?"
"george"," No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I 
              researched"
"jerry"," Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal."
"george"," This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful 
              thing!"
"jerry"," You've really gone mental."
"george"," Nah."
"jerry"," Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm 
              saying"
"george"," I got a sauce."
"jerry"," You got a mickey sauce?"
"george"," And Elaine is gonna keep him busy."
"jerry"," Elaine? How did you rope her into this?"
"george"," I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife."
"jerry"," She knew that."
"george"," But she didn't know he doesn't recycle."
"jerry"," What is the point of all this?"
"george"," Revenge. "
"jerry"," Oh, the best revenge is living well. "
"george"," There's no chance of that."
"jerry"," Did you get your laundry?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What's with you?"
"kramer"," He jumped."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah. Newman jumped. "
"jerry"," Did he call you last night?"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"jerry"," What did you say?"
"kramer"," I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."""
"jerry"," Whew. Did he wave?"
"kramer"," No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous 
              saw him from"
"jerry"," Oh, my god!"
"kramer"," What's the matter?"
"jerry"," Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For 
              some"
"kramer"," Where? Where?"
"jerry"," To the Laundromat. "
"kramer"," Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are 
              you doing?"
"jerry"," Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever 
              you want?"
"jerry"," So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? 
              You have a"
"jerry"," Come on. Let's go."
"kramer"," No. You can't let him get away with this."
"elaine"," Which one is he?"
"george"," That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah. I see him."
"george"," Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this."
"elaine"," Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?"
"george"," This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done."
"elaine"," Yeah. It is kind of cool."
"george"," First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone."
"elaine"," I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing 
              they do"
"george"," That's exactly what I told Jerry!"
"elaine"," Really?"
"george"," Yes!"
"george"," God, I've never felt so alive! "
"jerry"," Maybe we should call this off."
"kramer"," Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete 
              in"
"jerry"," And what's gonna happen?"
"kramer"," Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the 
              end of the"
"jerry"," If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. 
              You're like"
"kramer"," You keep him busy."
"kramer"," Whoa! "
"george"," You go over there -"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while 
              you're"
"elaine"," Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?"
"elaine"," Oops! 'Scuse me."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine","  "
"elaine"," Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much.  Really. 
              I mean"
"elaine"," People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as 
              they used to. Have"
"elaine"," So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. 
              Aah!"
"elaine"," Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. 
              Of"
"elaine"," Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. 
            "
"george","  Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have 
              this seat?"
"george","  I can't explain. It's very important that 
              I sit here."
"george","  Okay. Okay. Fine."
"elaine"," I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. 
              Naked."
"elaine"," Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble."
"jerry"," What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? "
"jerry"," Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in 
              a gentle"
"jerry"," What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind 
              of"
"jerry"," What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? 
              That must"
"kramer"," I didn't realize it was a full box."
"george"," I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, 
              the wig"
"george"," One..."
"elaine"," No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, 
              I - I"
"elaine"," I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy 
              do whatever"
"george"," Hello, Rick."
"george"," That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! "
"george"," Oh!"
"george"," Boom!"
"george"," Oh."
"george"," You want me to come back? Uh..."
"george"," Rick."
"george"," Uh, Rick.."
"george"," Rick."
"george"," Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a 
              professor,"
"elaine"," Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot 
              about it. I"
"jerry"," Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd 
              you"
"kramer"," It was in my laundry. "
"jerry"," In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in 
              our guys."
"kramer"," It was about 1200 bucks."
"newman"," Kramer!"
"kramer"," Oh! That's Newman."
"newman"," I'm on the roof!"
"kramer"," Well, what are you waiting for?"
"jerry"," Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. 
              I gotta"
"george"," I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy."
"kramer"," You wanna shoot some pool tonight?"
"newman"," I can't. I'm goin' to the movies."
"george"," Nah. It's probably a union thing."
"jerry"," You know, I tell ya, I 
              gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, 
              I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, 
              I have"
"elaine"," What do you got, a cucumber?"
"george"," Yeah, so what?"
"elaine"," You're bringing in an 
              outside cucumber?"
"george"," They refuse to put cucumber 
              in the salad. I need cucumber."
"jerry","  
              What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got 
              up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit."
"elaine"," No. Let me see that. 
               Don't-mess-with-Johnny."""
"jerry"," Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny 
              Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?"
"elaine","  Did you mess 
              with Johnny, Jerry?"
"george"," Let me see that. "
"elaine"," Hey, where's Kramer?"
"jerry"," I don't know. That's like 
              asking ""Where's Waldo?"""
"george","  
              I think I'm having a heart attack."
"jerry"," I don't think that's it."
"george"," I'm not kidding."
"jerry"," What does that mean?"
"elaine"," I think what he's trying 
              to say is that he's having a heart attack."
"jerry"," Oh, he's having a heart 
              attack."
"george"," Tightness.."
"jerry"," C'mon."
"george"," Shortness of breath.."
"jerry"," Oh, this is ridiculous."
"george"," Radiating waves of pain.."
"jerry"," I know what this is. You 
              saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.  I 
              saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure"
"george"," There was nothing else 
              on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm."
"jerry","  He saw that 
              show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks."
"george"," Why can't I have a heart 
              attack? I'm allowed."
"jerry"," So what do you want? You 
              want me take you to the hospital?"
"george"," Manhattan Memorial, less 
              of a line."
"jerry"," I'll call an ambulance. 
              "
"george"," We'll just take a check. 
               You made a mistake"
"elaine"," George!"
"george"," Are.. are you okay?"
"george"," I'm George.. George Costanza.. 
              I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I 
              had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any"
"jerry"," Well? What do you think?"
"jerry"," ""Salami salami bologna""?"
"jerry","  What a surprise. 
               Hey, how"
"george"," No, no thanks."
"jerry","  You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black 
              Hawks jacket you have?"
"george"," Oh, sure, my Black Hawks 
              jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket."
"jerry"," Well, you know, I was 
              thinking - if things don't exactly work out.."
"george"," Well, it wouldn't fit 
              you. The sleeves are too short."
"jerry"," No, I tried it on. It 
              fits good."
"george"," Well, I didn't really 
              think about what I was gonna do with all.."
"jerry"," Well, you know.."
"george","  Well, okay."
"jerry"," Oh, and.. do you think 
              it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?"
"george"," Susan Davis?  Hey, wait a second.."
"jerry"," Well, it's not like we'd 
              be bumping into you."
"george"," I don't know.. you and 
              Susan Davis?"
"jerry"," You know, if your future 
              was a little more certain.."
"george"," Okay, go ahead. Call 
              her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? 
              I'm finished.  It's all over for me. In fact, 
              let's"
"jerry"," Well, ah..  What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with 
              the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually"
"george"," What are ya doing?! Whadya, 
              crazy?!"
"elaine"," Jerry!"
"jerry","  Elaine, what are you doing here? "
"george","  Jerk off."
"jerry","  There's nothing 
              wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine."
"elaine"," Hi, George. How ya feeling? 
              Is anybody getting your apartment?"
"george"," I'll tell ya, if I ever 
              get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole 
              Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose 
              my"
"george","  Uh, yeah. You 
              know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better."
"george","  Oh God, Mommy!"
"george","  I haven't? 
              I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know 
              how to thank you."
"jerry","  Hey, that 
              was really fun, George. Can we go home now?"
"george"," Oh, sure. Sure, anything. 
              Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me."
"george","  
              What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it 
              Lupis?!"
"george"," My tonsils? Yeah, when 
              I was a kid."
"george"," Really?"
"elaine","  
              Whose tonsils grow back? "
"jerry"," Yeah, if you've been exposed 
              to gamma rays."
"elaine"," I still have my tonsils. 
              Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden 
              to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils."
"jerry","  Well, 
              it's like the Capulets and the Montagues."
"george","  Excuse me!"
"george"," What? You mean with a 
              knife?"
"george","  Yeah, that's 
              what they told me the last time."
"elaine","  Oh, I'm sorry. 
               I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. 
              "
"jerry"," Women go after doctors 
              like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the 
              body.. we just want the body."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Boy, they got a great 
              cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like 
              a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!  So, how"
"jerry","  
              Kramer."
"kramer"," The really bad thing 
              about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about 
              sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next"
"jerry"," Kramer, George didn't 
              have a heart attack."
"kramer"," No? That's good."
"george"," I have to have my tonsils 
              taken out."
"kramer"," Oh man.. No.. George, 
              we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya 
              in here."
"jerry","  It's routine surgery."
"kramer"," Oh yeah? My friend, Bob 
              Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine 
              surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a"
"george"," Well, what should I do, 
              Kramer?"
"jerry"," Well, for one think, don't 
              listen to him."
"kramer"," I'll tell you what to 
              do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll 
              fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just"
"jerry"," Eckman? I thought he was 
              doing time?"
"kramer"," No, no, he's out. He 
              got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame 
              him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel."
"jerry"," A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma 
              was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your 
              tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor."
"kramer"," He's holistic, George. 
              He's holistic."
"george"," Holistic.. that sounds 
              right."
"jerry"," George, you need a medical 
              doctor."
"george","  Let me ask 
              you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils 
              and adenoids removed in the hospital?"
"jerry"," Well, an overnight stay 
              in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand."
"george"," Uh-huh. And how much 
              does the healer charge?"
"kramer"," First visit? Thirty-eight 
              bucks."
"george"," Oh, yeah? Holistic.. 
              that's what I need. That's the answer."
"george"," So, how do you like the 
              way I talked you into comin' down here?"
"jerry"," Don't flatter yourself, 
              my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling 
              this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though."
"george"," All I know is I've been 
              going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three 
              years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm"
"jerry","  I've never had a really good pickle."
"george"," Besides, what's it gonna 
              cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?"
"jerry"," Sorry."
"george"," April."
"george"," Really?"
"george"," Yes."
"george"," ..Okay."
"kramer"," I'm off hot water."
"george"," Yes, yes I am."
"george","  
              Can I use hot water on my face?"
"jerry","  And you're not a doctor, but you play one 
              in real life."
"george","  
              What about shaving?"
"george"," I guess so."
"jerry","  
              There's some hot air blowing in here.."
"george","  Could it be lukewarm?"
"jerry"," Too much dairy? You really 
              think I'm eating too much dairy?"
"elaine"," Uh-huh."
"jerry"," I love crampbark."
"jerry"," Cleaver, I once had cleaver 
              as a kid. I was able to lift a car."
"jerry"," Couchgrass and crampbark? 
              You know, I think that's what killed Curly."
"kramer"," Go ahead, drink it, George."
"jerry"," Excuse me, Tor. May I 
              ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch 
              with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't 
              read."
"kramer"," Go ahead, drink it, George."
"george","  Hey, it's 
              not too bad.."
"george","  
              I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!"
"jerry","  Maybe he 
              doesn't like them. That's possible."
"george"," My face! My face! Get 
              me to the hospital!"
"jerry","  I'll get 
              you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?"
"jerry"," You're gonna fight?"
"george"," Now?! I'm a mutant!"
"kramer","  Hey, let 
              me drive."
"jerry","  Really, gentlemen, 
              please."
"george"," My heart! My heart!  Where you going? Are you crazy?!"
"kramer","  Hey, you 
              have keys?"
"george"," You can't leave! This 
              is an ambulance! This is an emergency!"
"jerry"," All this for a Chuckle."
"kramer"," What's a Chuckle?"
"jerry"," It's a jelly candy. it 
              comes in five flavors."
"elaine"," Can you let go of my 
              tongue now?"
"elaine"," Let go of my tongue!"
"elaine"," Well, I should get going.. 
               What are you 
              doing?"
"elaine"," A kiss? With the tongue? 
              The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think 
              so. "
"jerry"," You just can't leave him 
              out there."
"kramer"," Well, can you call him 
              an ambulance?"
"kramer"," hey, watch the road! 
              Watch the road, man!"
"jerry"," How ya doing?  Can't talk?  Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his"
"elaine"," Oh, poor George. Oh, 
              I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor 
              Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice"
"jerry"," Hey, check the TV."
"jerry","  That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming 
              Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so"
"jerry"," I have a friend who's 
              a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you 
              have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter"
"jerry"," Men flip around the television more than women, I think. 
              Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know 
              what the hell they're watching."
"george","  She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, 
              there is no justice."
"jerry"," She's the performance artist, right?"
"george","  Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. 
              A real trooper."
"jerry"," What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?"
"elaine"," Todd."
"jerry"," Todd. Oh yeah.  He's a Kennedy."
"elaine"," No, he's not."
"jerry"," C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something."
"elaine"," By marriage."
"jerry"," Oh, by marriage.  We went to their wedding. You 
              should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame 
              the whole thing on"
"george"," That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life."
"elaine"," Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, 
              intelligent woman."
"george"," What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent 
              women?"
"jerry"," Thin ice, George. Thin ice.."
"george","  Maybe for her new performance piece she'll 
              give birth on stage."
"elaine"," She stopped performing."
"george","  Oh, what a huge blow to the culture."
"jerry","  You believe this guy? He holds a grudge 
              like Khomeini."
"george"," She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront 
              in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances""."
"jerry"," Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?"
"george"," God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, 
              and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup 
              all over my new red"
"elaine"," It was an accident!"
"george"," Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at 
              me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, 
              I'm sitting there with chocolate all"
"jerry","  he thought he still had a shot."
"george"," And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never 
              even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. 
              Nothing. Like I"
"jerry"," What ever happened with the shirt?"
"george"," I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters."
"elaine"," I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her 
              a baby shower."
"jerry"," Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?"
"elaine"," anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying 
              no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval."
"george"," Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower."
"jerry"," Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for 
              me."
"george","  Ich bin ein sucker."
"elaine"," Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody 
              make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! 
              Who cares?! It's"
"george"," She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby 
              monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!"
"elaine","  I do have one teeny little problem, though."
"george"," Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing."
"elaine"," See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.."
"jerry"," But?"
"elaine"," My roommate has Lyme disease."
"jerry"," Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?"
"elaine"," She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr 
              with a twist of Lyme disease."
"jerry"," How did she get Lyme disease?"
"elaine"," I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, 
              Connecticut."
"jerry"," They still do that play?"
"elaine"," It's a classic."
"jerry"," With all the nudity?"
"elaine"," I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in."
"george","  Never said goodbye. Goodbye!"
"jerry"," Explain to me how this baby shower thing works."
"elaine"," What do you wanna know?"
"jerry"," Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of 
              violence?"
"elaine"," Rarely."
"jerry"," There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?"
"elaine"," No."
"jerry"," When is this suppose to be?"
"elaine"," Saturday."
"jerry"," Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. 
              They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?"
"elaine"," I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it."
"jerry"," 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes 
              misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! 
              And entire buffet is swept off"
"george"," Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that 
              woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive 
              myself until I do."
"jerry"," And if you do?"
"george"," I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least 
              it won't be about this."
"kramer"," What are you doing this for? Look at you.."
"jerry"," Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture."
"kramer"," But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my 
              house."
"jerry","  Leave me alone."
"kramer"," It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live 
              like this?!"
"jerry"," I'm not getting illegal cable!"
"kramer"," Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable 
              companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for 
              years."
"jerry"," No, I read in the paper.."
"kramer","  Oh, oh, the paper.."
"jerry"," Well, they might hook us up again."
"kramer"," Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care 
              about is the ""Big Mammoo.""  Oh, look 
              at you! You're banging things.."
"jerry"," Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception."
"kramer"," Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're 
              saying?!"
"jerry"," What you're suggesting is illegal."
"kramer"," It's not illegal."
"jerry"," It's against the law."
"kramer"," Well, yeah."
"jerry","  Just, just, hold this. Can 
              you hold that?"
"kramer","  Look, will you at least let me 
              bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. 
              He escaped the Gulag. He's"
"jerry"," A real human rights nut, huh?"
"kramer"," Yeah. He's intense, man."
"jerry"," I don't know. What if I get caught?"
"kramer"," Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. 
              Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get 
              him."
"jerry"," You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town 
              tomarrow."
"kramer"," No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed 
              by the time you get back."
"jerry","  Every time I turn on the TV, sirens 
              are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know 
              it.."
"kramer"," No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. 
              The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.."
"jerry","  Put it in."
"kramer"," You won't regret it.  Jerry's"
"jerry"," Seinfeld."
"jerry"," My cable hook-up? What about it?"
"jerry"," It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?"
"kramer"," Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They 
              were onto the scam from the very beginning."
"jerry"," Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. 
              We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about 
              the Russian guy? The Russian"
"kramer"," No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down 
              by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, 
              cupping Jerry's head in his"
"jerry"," Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?"
"jerry"," What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the 
              drinks now?"
"jerry","  Are they gonna go over the instructions again?"
"jerry"," I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear 
              of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying 
              is quite rational because, human"
"george"," Sounds like a rough trip."
"jerry"," Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, 
              when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed."
"george"," So, the college cancelled the gig?"
"jerry"," Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really 
              appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again."
"george","  Forget it."
"jerry"," No, really.. an airport run."
"george"," It's nothing."
"jerry"," Hey, it's one thing if I asked you ""Could you do me 
              a favor?"" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. 
              Jerry doesn't suspect anything -"
"jerry","  You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, 
              you know. He's always got some ulterior motive."
"george","  ..Ulterior motive."
"jerry"," Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. 
              Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the 
              shower."
"george","  What, tonight? 
              Now?"
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big 
            deal. We'll just go back to your place."
"george"," My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go 
              back to my place."
"jerry"," You want to get a bite?"
"george"," Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole 
              pot roast."
"jerry"," Well, so what should we do?"
"george"," Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?"
"jerry"," Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!"
"george","  What are you talking about?"
"jerry"," You're wearing the chocolate shirt!"
"george"," I am? What a strange coincidence.."
"jerry"," A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty 
              early in the morning.."
"george","  You gotta let me go over there."
"jerry"," What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own 
              baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse 
              it in club soda?"
"george"," No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the 
              scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and 
              I'm gonna say, ""Remember this"
"elaine"," So, where's Todd?"
"elaine"," Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is 
              up there? Is Rose up there?!"
"elaine"," Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is 
              he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is 
              he out of the loop?"
"elaine","  What is this?! What are you doing 
              here?"
"kramer"," We're putting in cable."
"elaine"," The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't 
              do this now!"
"kramer"," Oh, we have to do this now."
"elaine"," Who's this guy?"
"kramer"," Which one?"
"elaine"," Both of the them."
"kramer"," Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys."
"elaine"," Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?"
"kramer"," Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah."
"elaine"," You can't! You can't do this now!"
"kramer"," Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if 
              I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. 
              He won't like that."
"elaine"," Alright. Just do it fast and then get out."
"kramer","  Anatoly!  Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, 
              you and the gals can take a"
"jerry"," And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to 
              her?"
"george","  What am I going to say?!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate 
              on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that 
              kind of treatment! What,"
"jerry"," You'll never say that to her face."
"george"," Watch me."
"kramer","  Yeah, I eat the whole apple. 
              The core, stem, seeds, everything."
"elaine","  Kramer, Kramer, look at him.  
              Look! He's eating all the food!"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences 
              between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, 
              in Russian, the cable guy,"
"elaine"," Kramer!"
"kramer","  Uh.. Excuse me.."
"elaine"," What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town 
              for the weekend."
"jerry"," The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard."
"elaine"," I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable 
              in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything."
"jerry"," Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less 
              travelled for a reason."
"elaine","  George, don't even 
              think about it! Don't even dream about it!"
"george","  About what?"
"george"," Leslie."
"george"," George..  George Costanza."
"george","  You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, 
              kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?"
"george"," You took me to one of your shows.."
"george"," And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated 
              me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents 
              felt I had talent.."
"jerry"," I'm sorry, I.."
"jerry","  Oh, I, I, think I remember.."
"jerry"," Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your.."
"jerry"," No, I don't think that.."
"george"," Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd 
              be better suited for improvs, or something.."
"elaine"," I'm sorry you have to go."
"jerry"," Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. 
              I don't want cable."
"kramer"," Don't be a fool."
"jerry"," No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your 
              trouble.."
"jerry","  Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!"
"elaine"," Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on 
              here tonight. You know, I had no idea.."
"elaine","  Oh, thank 
              you.  ""Like 
              you were in college""?"
"george","  I'll be right back. "
"jerry","  I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't 
              even want the thing. What are you going to do?!"
"george"," Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control 
              of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?"
"elaine"," Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. 
              I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop."
"jerry"," Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who 
              takes that literally?"
"kramer","  Hey, come on over, 
              Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! "
"jerry"," What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't 
              want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What 
              do you say? What do you"
"jerry"," , go over time 
              on the call,"
"elaine"," No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's 
              as simple as"
"george"," Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage 
              men. It's"
"jerry"," I tell you what they should do, they should combine the 
              two jobs, make"
"elaine"," You should run for mayor."
"jerry"," Ehh, nobody listens."
"elaine"," Where is someone? I'm starving."
"george"," I think this is him right here."
"elaine"," Is there a table ready?"
"george"," I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. 
              I'm very"
"jerry"," Really? I thought things were going OK."
"george"," They were, it's kinda complicated."
"jerry"," Well what is it?"
"elaine"," How many?"
"jerry"," Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld."
"george"," What do you wanna do?"
"elaine"," Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry."
"jerry"," We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much 
              time if we"
"george"," I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?"
"george"," Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?"
"jerry"," So did I do a terrible thing?"
"elaine"," You mean lying to your uncle?"
"jerry"," I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', 
              one night"
"elaine"," Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right 
              away."
"jerry"," Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table."
"george"," He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna 
              look."
"elaine"," Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?"
"jerry"," Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house."
"elaine"," Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose 
              things."
"george"," I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it 
              with humanity? "
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark 
              hair,"
"elaine"," I've never seen her before."
"jerry"," I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy."
"elaine"," I'm sorry."
"elaine"," Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table."
"jerry"," Well maybe they were here from before."
"elaine"," No no no, they weren't here before."
"elaine"," Find out what's going on!"
"jerry"," Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we 
              were ahead of"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Seinfeld."
"elaine"," Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally 
              get a table? "
"jerry"," Boy, you are really hungry."
"george"," If anything happens here, can I count on you?"
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," If we decide to go at it."
"jerry"," Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble..."
"george"," I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little 
              outfit. "
"elaine"," I'm gonna faint..."
"jerry"," George, who is that woman in the stripes?"
"george"," I don't know her."
"jerry"," She looks so familiar."
"elaine"," Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First 
              Served, It"
"jerry"," I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you 
              do it."
"elaine"," What do you mean?"
"jerry"," You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't 
              say"
"george"," What are they gonna do?"
"jerry"," They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a 
              story to tell"
"elaine"," 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?"
"jerry"," 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples."
"elaine"," OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come 
              back here and"
"jerry"," No, no tricks."
"elaine"," Should I do it, George?"
"george"," For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow."
"elaine"," Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"elaine"," Did you see that?"
"george"," What were you doing?"
"jerry"," George, the phone's free."
"george"," Alleluia."
"george"," Excuse me, I was waiting here."
"george"," I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!"
"george"," That's not the point. The point is I was here first."
"george"," Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest 
              sensitivity"
"george"," Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it."
"elaine"," How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna 
              walk around,"
"jerry"," I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think 
              he bought that?"
"george"," Yeah, well, he probably bought it."
"jerry"," So what happened with Tatiana?"
"george"," I shouldn't even tell you this."
"jerry"," Come on..."
"george"," Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her 
              apartment."
"jerry"," I'm with you."
"george"," Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. 
              It's like"
"jerry"," This could only happen to you."
"george"," So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't 
              take this the"
"jerry"," You said this to her after."
"george"," No. During."
"jerry"," Oh, boy."
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Wow! So...?"
"george"," So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling 
              to compute this"
"elaine"," I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never 
              coming back"
"elaine"," Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? 
              Remember,"
"george"," She's off. "
"elaine"," Jerry, talk to that guy again."
"jerry"," What am I gonna say?"
"elaine"," Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late."
"jerry"," Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were 
              ahead of that"
"elaine"," He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?"
"elaine"," Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going 
              on here?!"
"george"," She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left 
              because those"
"jerry"," Didja leave a message?"
"george"," Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who 
              answers the"
"elaine"," Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman..."
"jerry"," Where do I know her?"
"jerry"," Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?"
"jerry"," Good, good, good... What's goin' on?"
"jerry"," Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever."
"jerry"," I know, I know... Well, you know."
"jerry"," Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that."
"elaine"," Hi, I'm Elaine."
"jerry"," I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine..."
"jerry"," Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. 
              I'm in"
"elaine"," The one you broke the plans with tonight?"
"jerry"," Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow 
              and"
"jerry"," ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister 
              to me."
"elaine"," You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and 
              gotten in"
"jerry"," Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 
              through 8"
"jerry"," Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we 
              gotta get a"
"elaine"," Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip 
              him some"
"jerry"," In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?"
"elaine"," Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go 
              out with a guy"
"george"," 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?"
"elaine"," Well what do you want to give him, change?"
"george"," It's more than the meal!"
"jerry"," Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways."
"george"," Alright. 7,7,  6. I'm not gonna eat 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              that much!"
"jerry"," I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?"
"george"," Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I 
              get flustered."
"elaine"," I guess it's you, Jer."
"jerry"," Me? What about you?"
"elaine"," Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."
"jerry"," The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress 
              in the world"
"elaine"," Give me the money."
"elaine"," How's it going'?"
"elaine"," Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down."
"elaine"," If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really 
              appreciate"
"elaine"," No no, I want to eat now! "
"elaine"," No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come 
              on, did you"
"jerry"," You lost the 20."
"elaine"," Well, how could he do that?"
"george"," You didn't make it clear."
"elaine"," Make it clear?"
"jerry"," What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the 
              money back."
"jerry"," Seinfeld."
"jerry"," No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?"
"jerry"," Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really 
              not relevant"
"jerry"," Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?"
"george"," So?"
"jerry"," There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy."
"elaine"," So when are we gonna eat?"
"jerry"," Five, ten minutes."
"george"," We should have left earlier. I told you."
"jerry"," I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie."
"elaine"," Oh, well I have to eat."
"jerry"," Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab."
"elaine"," Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?"
"jerry"," We'll eat it in the movie."
"elaine"," Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they 
              have big"
"jerry"," Well what do you suggest?"
"elaine"," I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em 
              down."
"jerry"," I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite 
              direction,"
"elaine"," I can't have popcorn for dinner!"
"jerry"," So they have hotdogs there."
"elaine"," Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor."
"george"," I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's 
              call. Let me"
"george"," Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?"
"george"," Well, was it for Costanza or..."
"george"," Well was it a woman?"
"george"," She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her."
"jerry"," Who's Cartwright?"
"george"," I'm Cartwright!"
"jerry"," You're not Cartwri-"
"george"," Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just 
              go to the"
"elaine"," Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'."
"jerry"," So You're not going?"
"elaine"," You don't need us."
"jerry"," Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna 
              make sarcastic"
"george"," Should we tell him we're leaving?"
"elaine"," What for? Let's just get out of here."
"jerry"," Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof 
              of that is"
"jerry"," I'm not a foodie. I don't, ""Oh, this is too rare. Oh, 
              it's too salty."" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, 
              whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls"
"elaine"," Do you want some of mine?"
"jerry"," Take some of mine."
"george"," Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep 
              trying to like it, like I have to like it."
"jerry"," Who said you have to like it?"
"george"," Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's 
              all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto."
"jerry"," I don't like pesto."
"george"," Where was pesto 10 years ago?"
"jerry","  Look at that guy.  I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. 
              Any time you see a guy that age"
"elaine","  The thing about that painting.. 
              is with the colors and um.. (Turns"
"jerry","  Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm 
              up for a minute."
"george"," That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower 
              for the conditioner to work."
"jerry"," I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab."
"george"," Who?"
"jerry"," Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking 
              him up at the airport tonight."
"george"," A guy?"
"elaine","  Yes, a guy."
"jerry"," He's from a.. Yakima, right?"
"elaine"," Seattle."
"jerry"," Everybody's moving to Seattle."
"george"," It's the pesto of cities. So..?"
"elaine","  You tell him."
"jerry"," Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met 
              a gentleman."
"elaine"," Ed."
"jerry"," Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."
"elaine"," ..We shared an interpersonal experience.  Go on."
"jerry"," So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow 
              returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash 
              off so easily."
"elaine"," On some people."
"george"," Oooh."
"jerry"," So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week."
"elaine"," It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became 
              a week."
"george"," Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle."
"elaine","  I'm never eating here again."
"jerry","  Nice going. Thank you, that ought 
              to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the 
              busboy out from the dining"
"george"," Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just 
              told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager 
              and busboy are arguing. The"
"elaine"," I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had 
              to know I was kidding."
"jerry","  
              I didn't say anything."
"george"," I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!"
"elaine"," Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
"george"," I didn't know he'd get fired."
"jerry","  
              He'll probably kill his family over this."
"george"," What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! 
              Did you see him point?!"
"jerry","  A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem 
              to gravitate twards 'em."
"george"," Was it my fault?"
"elaine"," Was it my fault?"
"jerry","  ..Maybe I'll try that 
              pesto."
"jerry"," Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. 
              I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish 
              your resume and undergo a series of"
"george","  Oh, like you really know busboys."
"jerry"," Oh, like you do."
"george"," Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
"jerry","  Camp."
"george"," It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me."
"jerry"," Elaine?"
"elaine","  Yeah."
"jerry"," Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I 
              know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at 
              the comedy clubs."
"george"," Then why don't you try and get him another job?"
"jerry"," I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could 
              be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people 
              with pins."
"elaine"," I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am 
              one clever chickadee."
"george"," What? Did you get the busboy's number?"
"elaine"," His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain 
              an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D.  Now, I did my"
"george"," How did you get all this?"
"elaine"," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
"jerry"," No.  So now you're going to his 
              apartment? I really think this is nuts."
"george","  I'd like to apologize. I want to 
              tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble."
"jerry"," You, you're going now?"
"george"," Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe 
              get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something."
"jerry"," Maybe the fat camp.  You're not going?"
"elaine"," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
"jerry"," I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till 
              after my set?"
"george"," It'll take to long."
"jerry"," Take the K-man. A little support.."
"george","  I don't a.."
"kramer"," Take me where? Where?"
"george"," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't 
              mind - try not to say too much."
"kramer"," What am I gonna say?"
"george"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Well, I'm not an idiot."
"george"," Certainly not."
"kramer"," Then we're cool."
"george"," Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool.  
              Uh, I'm sorry to bother"
"kramer","  He's a hell of a guy."
"george"," This is a guy I know.. Kramer."
"kramer"," Habla espanol?"
"george","  Oh my God."
"kramer"," Como se dice.. waterbed?"
"george","  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm 
              really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll 
              certainly be glad to do that."
"kramer"," You got anything to drink? Agua?"
"george"," Oy uy uy..  We really should 
              get going."
"kramer"," Let me get a glass of water. "
"george"," Hurry up."
"kramer"," His cat's gone."
"kramer"," ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, 
              she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never 
              know. They got things in"
"george","  Once again, Antonio, I 
              can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. 
              The job, the cat.. (A"
"kramer"," The wire was sticking out..  Yeah."
"george","  Here's my card. I'm in real estate, 
              so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. 
              (Antonio is staring at him,"
"kramer"," You oughta get that wire fixed.  I got 
              the door. "
"jerry","  George, stop worrying about this guy. It 
              wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry","  Hey.  He doesn't even know where 
              you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?..  That's Elaine."
"kramer"," It's been a week. It's up to the cat now."
"jerry","  Kramer says it's up to the cat now.  
              It'll be on your conscience."
"kramer"," Oh? How do you figure?"
"jerry","  How do you figure?  'Cause you're 
              the one who left the door open."
"kramer"," Why was I in charge of closing the door?"
"jerry","  Why was he in charge of closing the door?  'Cause you came in after 
              him!"
"kramer"," So!"
"jerry","  So!  So, 
              the last person in should close the door!"
"kramer"," Let me talk to him."
"jerry","  Talk - call him from your house.  He's calling you now.. okay. "
"elaine"," Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?"
"jerry"," No hello?"
"elaine"," Got any asprin?  Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee 
              this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?"
"jerry"," Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car."
"elaine"," Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem 
              at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy 
              on a plane to Seattle and out of my"
"jerry","  So, did you have a nice week together?"
"elaine"," I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that 
              ping?"
"jerry"," There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?"
"elaine"," Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and 
              he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful 
              guy, but I hate his guts!"
"jerry"," So, you two been, uh.."
"jerry"," What's your airport route?"
"elaine"," I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel."
"jerry"," ..What about the Van Wyck?"
"elaine"," I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on 
              to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut."
"jerry"," Oooh."
"elaine"," Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting 
              up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?"
"jerry"," You still using that old alarm clock?"
"jerry"," Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport 
              can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're 
              getting on the plane, if you miss"
"elaine","  Get up! The alarm clock didn't go 
              off!  It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!"
"elaine"," Yes! 915!"
"elaine"," Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go!  You get"
"elaine"," Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!"
"elaine"," Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your 
              clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, 
              turning them over in the suitcase."
"elaine"," The kitchen?!"
"elaine"," They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!"
"elaine"," No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!"
"elaine"," Don't say that!"
"elaine"," Shut up and pack!"
"elaine"," You're talking too much!"
"elaine"," What?!"
"elaine"," What? What sweater?"
"elaine"," You didn't bring a brown sweater."
"elaine"," Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?!  You got 
              a brown sweater!"
"elaine"," It's brown! "
"elaine"," NO time for folding..  I think that's it. 
              "
"elaine"," Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the 
              fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without 
              them! (Puts her coat on over"
"jerry"," Anywhere in the city?"
"george"," Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet."
"jerry"," Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?"
"george"," Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention 
              my name - she'll give you the key."
"jerry"," Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth."
"george","  ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, 
              the Met. Magnificent facilities."
"elaine","  I never new I could drive 
              like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, 
              it all seemed to be happening in"
"kramer"," ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!"
"george"," The busboy's coming?"
"jerry"," You don't mean here?"
"kramer"," Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up.."
"george"," He's coming up?!  I'll check you out 
              later."
"jerry"," Where are you going?"
"george"," I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score."
"jerry","  No. You three all 
              know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this 
              stage of the game."
"kramer"," No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it."
"george"," Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I.."
"kramer"," Antonio. In here!"
"george","  Hey, Antonio. How's it going?"
"george","  Ah, come on.."
"elaine","  Yeah?"
"elaine"," He's coming up.  He's coming up.."
"jerry"," He'll get another job. He's a busboy!"
"george"," It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast 
              comes off."
"jerry"," It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it."
"george"," That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with 
              his knee."
"elaine"," Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio.  ..Thanks."
"george"," So, much longer?"
"elaine"," Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can 
              feed himself?"
"george","  I guess it's not important."
"elaine"," Take care of yourselves. "
"george"," I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita 
              by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy."
"jerry"," Yeah..  How ya doing?"
"jerry"," First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. 
              People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we 
              have boxing either. It's really kind of an"
"george","I don't understand. Paper Machay hats? "
"george","What if it rains? "
"george","Oh, art! "
"george","Any money in it?"
"george","Of course, right."
"george","Tommy C."
"jerry"," These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86."
"kramer"," I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't 
              know you'd get audited "
"jerry"," I don't blame you. I blame myself. "
"kramer"," No, blame me."
"jerry"," OK, I blame you. "
"kramer"," Don't blame me."
"jerry"," What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date 
              with Elaine. You come "
"kramer"," It was supposed to erupt."
"jerry"," I find the whole thing very embarrassing."
"kramer"," You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even 
              pay taxes."
"jerry"," Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income."
"elaine"," Hi,"
"jerry"," Hi"
"elaine"," Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making 
              pasta in my"
"elaine"," What's so funny"
"jerry"," Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny. "
"elaine"," Uh, it's a riot Alice. "
"kramer"," When do you pit the sauce on?"
"elaine"," Any other time."
"kramer"," I like to strain the sauce."
"elaine"," And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... 
              and the make out sessions "
"kramer"," Yeah, Tina likes the couch."
"elaine"," What are you doing? What is all this?"
"jerry"," Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited. 
            "
"elaine"," O, your being auditted? What for?"
"jerry"," Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to 
              be fraudulent. It's very "
"elaine"," When was this? "
"jerry"," Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. "
"elaine"," I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first 
              date."
"jerry"," Volcano? Really? "
"elaine"," Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ... "
"jerry"," Something to drink? "
"elaine"," What did you think, that would impress me? "
"jerry"," You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans 
            "
"elaine"," Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing 
              my clothes off?"
"jerry"," Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much 
              for so long."
"elaine"," Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's 
              Karma."
"jerry"," No, that's Krama."
"elaine"," So, waddya' going to do?"
"jerry"," It's all taken care of."
"elaine"," How is that?"
"kramer"," &lt;chuckles&gt;"
"jerry"," An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, 
            "
"elaine"," Why is she doing this?"
"jerry"," I don't know. It must be love."
"george"," I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're 
              great but I'm I'm riddled with "
"george"," Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. 
              I don't know how to love. "
"george"," No, no,"
"george"," I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but 
              they look very nice. "
"george"," I have a fear of intimacy "
"george"," Nothing. It's not YOU.."
"george"," The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is 
              the chopsticks but it's so much "
"george"," I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little 
              harsh. "
"george"," Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?"
"george"," Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f..."
"jerry"," ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this 
              woman to help"
"elaine"," I don't blame ya'"
"jerry"," Have you ever been through an audit?"
"elaine"," No."
"jerry"," It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal"
"jerry"," Yeah"
"george"," George "
"jerry"," Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis 
              Costanza. Here I am about to go "
"george"," My whole life has been a complete waste of time, &lt;chuckle&gt;"
"jerry"," And there's so much more to go."
"george"," Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. "
"jerry"," So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers? 
            "
"george"," Oh, oh, your papers"
"jerry"," What happened you didn't give her the papers? "
"george"," No. I did. "
"jerry"," SO? "
"george"," ...I broke up with her. "
"jerry"," You what? "
"george"," I broke up with her. "
"jerry"," I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?"
"george"," It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still 
              do it. "
"jerry"," Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't 
              do you favors after you dump "
"george"," Oh, no. We left on good terms. "
"jerry"," How is that possible? "
"george"," Because I uh, I told her the truth. "
"jerry"," Oh, my God. "
"george"," It's OK."
"jerry"," It's unheard of ..."
"george"," She asked me to."
"jerry"," So you lie! What did you tell her? "
"george"," I told her that she was pretentious. "
"jerry"," Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her 
              she was"
"elaine"," How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?"
"george"," Like what? What could they say?"
"elaine"," There are plenty of things to say. "
"george"," Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there 
              an odor I'm not aware of?"
"elaine"," George, please."
"george"," Give me one."
"elaine"," You sure?"
"george"," Yes."
"elaine"," What? "
"elaine"," Forget it. You are very careful with money."
"george"," I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that 
              to me? I can't"
"elaine"," You asked me to. "
"george"," You should have lied."
"elaine"," HUH, so should you."
"jerry"," OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers? 
            "
"george","&lt;ignoring Jerry&gt; I mean I'm not really working right 
              now. "
"elaine"," I know. "
"george"," When I was working I spent baby. "
"jerry"," Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to 
              the papers? "
"george"," She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with 
              her."
"elaine"," Pocketbook or a handbag? "
"jerry"," Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office."
"george"," Give me the phone. &lt;dials&gt; Yea, Hi I would like to 
              speak to Patrice. ..."
"jerry"," What? What? "
"george"," She never came back from lunch. "
"jerry"," This is no good. This is no good. Call her house. "
"george"," &lt;dials&gt; Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, &lt;hangs 
              up&gt; She hung up. "
"jerry"," Not good."
"george"," All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just 
              a little"
"jerry"," Not good "
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a windshield. "
"jerry"," I can see that. What's it for?"
"kramer"," I found it on the road."
"jerry"," Yeah "
"elaine","  I just finished working out are you busy?"
"jerry"," Come on up."
"kramer"," Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going 
              to make a"
"jerry"," wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to 
              just sense it's"
"kramer"," wow"
"elaine"," hell-oo"
"kramer"," hell-oo"
"jerry"," What's with you two?"
"elaine"," You haven't told him? "
"jerry"," Tell me what?"
"elaine"," Huh, go ahead, tell him. "
"kramer"," I, I saw her naked. "
"elaine"," He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked. "
"kramer"," Well, you know, ... it was an accident. "
"elaine"," Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want 
              to know!"
"kramer"," I thought it was a closet. "
"jerry"," Completely naked? "
"kramer"," Completely naked. "
"elaine"," Jerrryyy, How can I go on? "
"kramer"," All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you 
              feel any better you can see me naked. "
"elaine"," No thanks!"
"kramer"," No, I want you to see me naked. "
"elaine"," No, no no."
"kramer"," No, I want to show you."
"elaine"," No! Jerry! Jerry!"
"jerry"," OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you 
              know you are always welcome in my "
"elaine"," Ehat is this?"
"kramer"," Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee 
              table. "
"elaine"," Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't 
              even see it. "
"jerry"," You'll sense it."
"jerry"," Well, what happened? Was she there? "
"george"," No, no she wasn't."
"jerry"," You didn't get my papers?"
"george"," No, I didn't."
"jerry"," Well, where is she?"
"george"," A mental institution. "
"jerry"," A mental institution?"
"kramer"," You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? 
              They put those electrodes in "
"george"," It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a 
              depression"
"elaine"," Who told you this"
"george"," Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but 
              never to a mental institution. "
"kramer"," My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses 
              were so large, it had no effect. "
"jerry"," You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was 
              there any"
"george"," She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them 
              out there with her."
"jerry"," So what now? "
"george"," I don't know. "
"jerry"," Can we go out there? "
"george"," Where?"
"jerry"," Woodhaven."
"george"," We could. "
"george"," I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental 
              patient before. "
"jerry"," My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He 
              came over to"
"george"," I should be in a place like this I envy this woman. Ya' 
              get to wear"
"jerry"," That'd be great. There's no wrong answer. "
"george"," Potato"
"jerry"," Tuberculosis"
"george"," Blanket"
"jerry"," Leroy"
"george"," Grass"
"jerry"," Tuberculosis"
"george"," Oh, boy. Here she comes."
"elaine"," Oh, my god."
"elaine"," KRAMER!"
"kramer"," Hey."
"elaine"," WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON."
"kramer"," Uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. 
              There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby."
"elaine"," It's invisible."
"kramer"," So, is everything cool? or what?"
"elaine"," Well, "
"elaine"," The Truth!, You want The Truth? "
"george"," Oh, this is my friend Jerry."
"jerry"," Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came 
              because I, I heard so many nice things "
"george"," Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone 
              who was"
"george"," No, that's not it at all."
"george","I'M NOT A LIER!"
"george"," Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool "
"jerry"," Just chatting. Friendly. "
"george"," All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices. "
"george"," What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go 
              two minutes without saying stupid things."
"jerry"," It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, 
              when you come to one of these places, "
"george"," You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even 
              know someone like you. "
"george"," Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile. "
"jerry"," He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important 
              papers in their, uh, pocket book. "
"jerry"," there are no copies."
"jerry"," Who makes copies? "
"elaine"," The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple. 
            "
"kramer"," Oh,"
"kramer"," No, lets go to the couch..."
"jerry"," &lt;on phone&gt;Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt 
              for a computer thatI bought there.... "
"jerry"," Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think 
              I may have tracked down another receipt. "
"elaine"," I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital."
"jerry"," George? "
"george"," I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time 
              poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, "
"kramer"," Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I suppose I am. "
"kramer"," All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab."
"jerry"," You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride."
"george"," Hey, I'm getting in on that."
"elaine"," You know you're chippin' in."
"george"," You're going that way anyway! "
"jerry"," I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. 
        I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing 
        suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go 
        down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear 
        one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've 
        got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing 
        suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear 
        if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like 
        floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that 
        you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You 
        bump into somebody you know ""No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for 
        the boat to come back."""
"elaine"," Hi Mr. Seinfeld! "
"jerry"," Hey, there's the old man! "
"jerry"," We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place."
"jerry"," What's the difference?"
"jerry"," I don't wanna use your car."
"jerry"," Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?"
"jerry"," So what would you do? You'd hitch?"
"jerry"," I don't know. 25 bucks a day."
"jerry"," Oh, I didn't get the insurance."
"jerry"," You're not paying for it."
"jerry"," God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?"
"jerry"," It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?"
"jerry","  Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd."
"elaine","  Ooh, you have a lake?"
"jerry"," The lake isn't real."
"jerry"," I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here."
"elaine"," I can't take your bedroom."
"elaine"," I can't kick you out of your bed."
"jerry"," Ma."
"jerry","  What about you?"
"jerry","  What about him?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I'll just stay in here. "
"jerry"," No that's not such a good idea."
"jerry"," Not now. She's right inside."
"jerry"," I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple."
"jerry"," Well..."
"jerry"," Shh! Nothing, nothing."
"jerry","  ...but you know, 
        look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just 
        goes to show you. You never know what... huh  you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. 
        It could just take right off at any time.  We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem 
        to be friend when we sleep together."
"jerry"," I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking."
"jerry"," I'm going for the record."
"jerry"," Oh, come on."
"jerry"," Nice to meet you. This is Elaine."
"elaine"," Hi. Nice to meet you."
"elaine"," And scuba diving."
"jerry"," We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time."
"jerry"," For fun."
"jerry"," I don't think so."
"jerry"," What kind of pen is that?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you 
        get it?"
"jerry"," Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        my elbow to make the pen works."
"jerry"," Oh no."
"jerry"," I couldn't"
"jerry"," I can't take it."
"jerry"," No, I'm not..."
"jerry"," I cannot take it!"
"jerry"," Are you sure?"
"jerry"," O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!"
"elaine"," Mmm, nice to meet you."
"jerry"," Thanks again."
"jerry"," What he gave it to me."
"jerry"," He offered it to me."
"jerry"," I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?"
"jerry"," He could have said ""Thank you, I like it too"" and put 
        it back in his pocket."
"jerry"," If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
"jerry"," Well, he was wrong."
"jerry"," So you want me to return it?"
"jerry"," Hey I don't even want the pen now!"
"elaine"," Here, let me see it.  Hey, it 
        wrtites upside down."
"elaine"," Come in."
"jerry"," Are you O.K. in here?"
"elaine"," Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?"
"jerry"," It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We 
        leave on Sunday. It's one day, really."
"elaine"," Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing 
        me."
"jerry"," Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my 
        feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule."
"elaine"," I am never gonna fall asleep."
"jerry"," Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me."
"elaine"," How can they not put the air conditioning on?"
"jerry"," They're nuts with temperature."
"elaine"," This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent."
"jerry"," How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?"
"elaine"," I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating."
"jerry"," It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers 
        and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. "
"jerry"," Stay on Biscayne."
"jerry"," Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done."
"jerry"," What's so special up here?"
"elaine"," Oh!"
"elaine"," My back."
"elaine"," That... That bed. The bar was right in my back."
"jerry"," Then YOU would be hunched over."
"elaine"," I don't even know if I can go scuba diving."
"jerry"," You can't go?"
"elaine"," You can go."
"jerry"," Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here."
"jerry"," You sure?"
"jerry"," We'll stay in a hotel tonight."
"elaine","  Yes!"
"jerry"," Why don't you get a new sofa?"
"jerry"," I'm buying you a new sofa."
"elaine"," Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner 
        on."
"elaine"," I've lost 6 pounds."
"jerry"," Hi. How are you?"
"jerry"," Evelyn, this is Elaine."
"elaine","  Hi Evelyn."
"jerry"," Too thin?"
"jerry","  What?"
"elaine"," The astronauts use them."
"jerry"," I never really wanted the pen."
"jerry"," No, no, I..."
"elaine"," Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!"
"jerry"," All I said was ""I like the pen""."
"elaine"," No no, I wanna go."
"elaine"," Oh, oh, O.K.  
        You can turn down the air conditioning if you want."
"elaine"," You're not too cold?"
"jerry"," Don't be alarmed."
"jerry"," I'm O.K. My capillaries burst."
"jerry","  How are you doing?"
"elaine"," Having a good time!"
"jerry"," Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?"
"jerry"," Well I started to go under..."
"jerry"," Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous 
        pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets."
"elaine"," My back hurts."
"jerry"," I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool."
"jerry"," Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give 
        me the pen, but I don't really need it."
"jerry"," I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. "
"jerry"," Take it."
"jerry"," What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's 
        happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is 
        it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?"
"jerry"," Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?"
"jerry"," Well. This should be a very interesting evening."
"elaine","  Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?"
"elaine"," Say what?  Say what?"
"jerry","  You took too many of those pills."
"elaine","  Astro...naut!"
"jerry"," Oh God. "
"jerry","  Uncle Leo."
"jerry"," I've got a black eye."
"jerry"," Elaine, this is my aunt Stella."
"jerry","  Her back hurts."
"jerry"," No, no."
"elaine","  STELLA! STELLA!"
"jerry"," Dad!"
"jerry","  I can't. Nobody's even listening."
"jerry","  Oh God!  huh... Hey! How you folks 
        doing tonight? "
"jerry","  Have you ever noticed how they always 
        give you the peanuts on the planes?"
"jerry"," Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is 
        a peanut?"
"jerry"," All I said was I liked the pen!"
"elaine","  STELLA!"
"elaine"," Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?"
"jerry"," There must be some mistake."
"elaine","  Five days. Here."
"jerry","  Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean 
        you just gonna be..."
"elaine"," Excuse me?"
"jerry"," Nothing."
"jerry"," Hi Evelyn."
"elaine","  Five more days?"
"jerry"," Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday 
        we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It 
        will go by like that. "
"jerry"," Is he on the plane now?"
"jerry"," Uh, just my next door neighbor."
"jerry"," Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?"
"jerry"," What's the matter?"
"jerry"," Huh? How you feeling?"
"jerry"," Farfel?"
"jerry"," The dog? The dog??"
"jerry"," But, you know, what if, you know?"
"jerry"," The dog?<br/>
"
"jerry"," Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid<br/>
              idiot! Shut up!  So what would you do?"
"elaine"," Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call."
"elaine"," If only."
"jerry"," Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house<br/>
              at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of<br/>
              the house since I got back."
"elaine"," Hey, when you walk him, do ya..."
"jerry"," Do I what?"
"elaine"," Do you pick it up?"
"jerry"," Yes, I pick it up."
"elaine"," You pick it up?!?"
"jerry"," Well you have to."
"elaine"," Oh, boy would I love to see that."
"jerry"," SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it!  I don't know what to<br/>
              do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?"
"elaine"," Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is."
"jerry"," No, I tried. they don't know anything.  You gotta put the syrup in first."
"elaine"," No, milk."
"jerry"," I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."
"elaine"," What is a bender anyhow?"
"jerry"," I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
"elaine"," I can't believe he hasn't called."
"jerry"," Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his<br/>
              dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
"kramer"," Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
"jerry"," Why?"
"elaine"," We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
"kramer"," I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
"jerry"," You're breaking up?"
"kramer"," Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You<br/>
              know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their<br/>
              feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,<br/>
              watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah."
"elaine"," Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
"kramer"," Woah, you didn't like her?"
"elaine"," If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant<br/>
              Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps."
"jerry"," I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet."
"kramer"," How come you never said anything?"
"jerry"," You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after<br/>
              they stop seeing them."
"kramer"," I tell you."
"jerry"," You. I'm talking about people."
"elaine"," Are we still going to the movies tonight?"
"jerry"," No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me."
"elaine"," Just me and George?"
"jerry"," Sure."
"elaine"," But we need you."
"jerry"," What do you need me for?"
"elaine"," Because... Yeah?"
"george"," Prognosis Negative!"
"elaine"," Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. <br/>
              Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just<br/>
              put some newspapers down or something?"
"jerry"," No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's<br/>
              right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!"
"elaine"," Just me and George alone?"
"george"," Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha<br/>
              ha!!!"
"jerry"," I can't go."
"george"," Can't go, Why not?"
"jerry"," Because I have to watch idiot Farfel."
"george"," I thought Kramer was watching."
"jerry"," He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight."
"george"," Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
"jerry"," No, I don't want that smell in the house."
"george"," You spritz a little Lysol on it."
"jerry"," No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of<br/>
              strange mutant funk."
"george"," So we're not going?"
"jerry"," Nah. You two go."
"george"," Oh. You still wanna go?"
"elaine"," Do you?"
"george"," If you want."
"elaine"," It's up to you."
"jerry"," Go ahead."
"elaine"," Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,<br/>
              you wanna see Ponce de Leon?"
"george"," Ponce de Leon? Okay.  You sure you don't wanna go?"
"jerry"," I want to but I can't."
"elaine"," Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean<br/>
              everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can<br/>
              switch apartments for the night."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," What about this--"
"jerry"," Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."
"elaine"," I know, it's not that."
"george"," It's just we want you to go."
"jerry"," Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!<br/>
"
"george"," So how long did you live there?"
"elaine"," About three years."
"george"," That's pretty long."
"elaine"," Hmm."
"george"," It's not that long, really."
"elaine"," Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same<br/>
              time, then stop. Another silence."
"george"," And then you came here."
"elaine"," Yeah. So I've been here about six years."
"jerry"," Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from<br/>
              me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!<br/>
"
"kramer"," I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do<br/>
              something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to<br/>
              society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? <br/>
              Couldn't respect myself."
"george"," I like herbal tea."
"george"," Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure."
"elaine"," Jerry likes Morning Thunder."
"george"," Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
"elaine"," Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it."
"george"," You don't tell him?"
"elaine"," No."
"george"," That is so funny!"
"elaine"," I know!"
"george"," Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
"kramer"," Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,<br/>
              every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do<br/>
              anything!<br/>
"
"jerry"," That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on<br/>
              Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. <br/>
              Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.  That's it, Farfel! <br/>
              Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're<br/>
              checking out!<br/>
"
"elaine"," It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many<br/>
              situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one."
"jerry"," Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
"elaine"," The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of<br/>
              you."
"jerry"," Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on<br/>
              down.  What?"
"elaine"," Do you have to?"
"jerry"," What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not<br/>
              sure this is a dog."
"elaine"," You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
"jerry"," I'm in the book and I have a machine."
"elaine"," Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them<br/>
              there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them."
"jerry"," Really? How late are they open?"
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," What is it?"
"kramer"," I went back with Ellen."
"elaine"," Terrific."
"jerry"," Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
"elaine"," Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
"kramer"," Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?"
"jerry"," I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
"kramer"," From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you<br/>
              don't know me."
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
"jerry"," What are you doing?"
"kramer"," I'm getting my pot."
"elaine"," Kramer, we like her."
"jerry"," Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?"
"elaine"," I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit."
"jerry"," I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said<br/>
              anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes.  <br/>
              Yeah?"
"george"," Prognosis Negative!"
"jerry"," Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
"elaine"," Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
"jerry"," It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
"elaine"," Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the<br/>
              movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight."
"jerry"," I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
"elaine"," We'll see it Sunday."
"george"," Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
"elaine"," I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
"george"," What does this mean?"
"jerry"," Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De<br/>
              Leon."
"george"," What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
"jerry"," She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go<br/>
              to the bathroom."
"george"," Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
"jerry"," I don't know, regular human time?"
"george"," Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?"
"jerry"," Why shouldn't I go here?"
"elaine"," Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure<br/>
              you get your seats and then go to the bathroom."
"george"," And isn't it more fun using the urinal?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
"george"," Hey, go."
"elaine"," Who's stopping you?"
"george"," What, are you doing me a favor?"
"elaine"," Like we care if you go to the bathroom."
"george"," How's it going?"
"elaine"," Good. Good. You?"
"george"," Things are good."
"elaine"," Boy, he takes such a long time."
"george"," I know."
"elaine"," You know what he does in there? He gargles."
"george"," Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?"
"elaine"," Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
"george"," How come we never hear him?"
"elaine"," Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,<br/>
              watch."
"george"," Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
"elaine"," We talked about that already."
"george"," Oh.<br/>
"
"george"," I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm<br/>
              out of conversation."
"jerry"," So what are calling me six times a day?"
"george"," All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,<br/>
              I could always read the sports section."
"jerry"," I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire."
"george"," Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out."
"jerry"," It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
"george"," Nothing except Prognosis Negative."
"jerry"," Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.<br/>
"
"elaine"," Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! <br/>
              When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!"
"elaine"," Shut up. Shut up!  Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my<br/>
              god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your<br/>
              dog tonight or he has humped his last leg."
"george"," I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but<br/>
              it's this or nothing."
"jerry"," I don't know what to do."
"george"," What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
"jerry"," I know, I know."
"george"," So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
"jerry"," It is kind of silly."
"george"," Of course it is."
"jerry"," I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
"george"," Exactly."
"jerry"," It's not like she's *in* the movie."
"george"," Right."
"jerry"," Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I<br/>
              mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these<br/>
              circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies."
"george"," And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
"jerry"," How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level<br/>
              of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,<br/>
              let's just go."
"george"," Good."
"jerry"," Saving movies."
"george"," Ridiculous!"
"jerry"," Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble."
"george"," Oh, you're dead.<br/>
"
"jerry"," You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said<br/>
              you were released on Monday."
"kramer"," Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!"
"kramer"," Hey you keep that mutt away from me."
"jerry"," Oh, hi Ellen."
"jerry"," Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,<br/>
              but if you don't mind..."
"jerry"," Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life."
"elaine"," We made plans."
"jerry"," Why don't we just rent a movie?"
"elaine"," I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative."
"jerry"," No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,<br/>
              there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard."
"elaine"," Jerry, you promised me we'd go."
"jerry"," Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost<br/>
              feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it."
"elaine"," Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it."
"jerry"," You and George got together?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about."
"jerry"," Hello."
"jerry"," What's up?"
"kramer"," Well, you were right."
"jerry"," About what?"
"kramer"," Ellen. We, uh, broke up again."
"jerry"," Too bad."
"elaine"," I thought she was the one."
"kramer"," I'll bring back the pot."
"elaine"," Okay, c'mon it's movie time."
"kramer"," Hey, what are you gonna see?"
"jerry"," Prognosis Negative."
"kramer"," Hey, that's supposed to be great."
"jerry"," It's not."
"kramer"," How do you know?"
"jerry"," I have an instinct for these things.<br/>
"
"jerry"," Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. 
              An overdue book "
"kramer"," enters"
"jerry"," Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there 
              in like a half hour. "
"kramer"," What's the problem?"
"jerry"," This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took 
              out Tropic of Cancer "
"kramer"," Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day 
              for 20 years. It's "
"jerry"," It doesn't work like that."
"kramer"," If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000"
"jerry"," It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember 
              it very vividly "
"jerry"," That orange dress is burned in my memory "
"kramer"," Oh, memory burn."
"jerry"," I wonder what ever happened to her."
"kramer"," How did they ever find you?"
"jerry"," Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. 
              The whole thing is "
"jerry"," It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library"
"kramer"," You know I never got a library card."
"jerry"," &lt;to speaker&gt; Coming down."
"kramer"," It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People 
              sitting around reading "
"jerry"," I gotta go to the library. You want to go?"
"kramer"," Yeah, "
"kramer"," The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that 
              Dewey guy really cleaned "
"jerry"," Where's George"
"kramer"," Tryin' to save a quarter."
"jerry"," I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house."
"jerry"," This woman's completely ignoring me."
"kramer"," Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. 
              ... Spinster. ... "
"jerry"," Eventually a little shot of penicillin"
"jerry"," Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail."
"kramer"," Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?"
"kramer"," That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone."
"jerry"," Can I speak with this Bookman?"
"george"," Jerry, "
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," I think I saw him. I think it's him."
"jerry"," Who?"
"george"," Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming 
              obsenities and doing some "
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer"," yeah"
"george"," I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our 
              High School."
"jerry"," &lt;whispers&gt; Are you sure?"
"george"," He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but 
              I think it's him."
"jerry"," George got him fired. He squealed on him."
"kramer"," Ooh tattle tale"
"george"," &lt;yells&gt; I didn't tattle "
"kramer"," What did this guy do? What happened?"
"george"," There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it."
"kramer"," Oh come on, You can tell me."
"george"," Some other time."
"kramer"," What tonight?"
"kramer"," Y'know I never figured you for a squealer."
"jerry"," Oh, he sang like a canary."
"jerry"," Not here? Why was I told to come down here?"
"kramer"," He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?"
"jerry"," Well what am I supposed to do now?"
"jerry"," All right Thanks. Come on lets go"
"george"," Let's see if it's Hayman?"
"kramer"," Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. &lt;TURNS TO LIBRARIAN&gt; 
              So uh, what's a guy got to do "
"elaine"," Where's Karen?"
"elaine"," She didn't ask me what I wanted. "
"elaine"," How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day 
              here for 3 and a half years? "
"elaine"," Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know 
              anything"", means there's "
"elaine"," Oh, hi Mr. Lippman."
"elaine"," Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at 
              that , um, biography of "
"elaine"," It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth."
"elaine"," I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything 
              I recommend. "
"jerry"," So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!"
"elaine"," What do you know. You've never worked in an office. &lt;TURNS 
              TO GEORGE&gt; See, "
"george"," I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. 
              Listen. Just because "
"elaine"," What did he do?"
"george"," He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, 
              ""Costanza"" He'd say, "
"jerry"," I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole 
              class. And the straps "
"george"," OK, OK, I never even had him for gym."
"jerry"," I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from 
              an exhumed corpse. "
"george"," Little baked beans"
"jerry"," Echh"
"elaine"," Come on tell me what happened."
"george"," Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually 
              failed me in gym. "
"george"," ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ... "
"george"," Yes, Mr. Hayman"
"george"," Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts."
"george"," I'm not really sure, I..."
"george"," He gave me a wedgie."
"jerry"," He got fired the next day."
"elaine"," Why do they call it a wedgie?"
"george"," Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... 
              it wedges in.."
"jerry"," They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to 
              actually get the "
"elaine"," Boys are sick."
"jerry"," Well what do girls do ?"
"elaine"," We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder."
"kramer"," Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman 
              from the library "
"jerry"," Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened 
              out. Would"
"jerry"," Coffee?"
"jerry"," No, I don't drink coffee."
"jerry"," No, I don't have--"
"jerry"," Well, I don't normally--"
"jerry"," I don't."
"jerry"," Really? I'll have to remember that."
"jerry"," Yes, and I returned it in 1971."
"jerry"," Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it 
              very"
"jerry"," I try."
"jerry"," No, I don't."
"jerry"," Certainly not."
"kramer"," What's wrong?"
"kramer"," So I didn't do anything wrong."
"kramer"," Why don't ya' leave?"
"jerry"," No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I 
              have a witness "
"jerry"," So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library? 
            "
"jerry"," Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange? "
"jerry"," No Black Jack? "
"jerry"," Tropic of Cancer."
"jerry"," Tropic of Capricorn? "
"jerry"," Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of 
              them. "
"jerry"," Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything 
              happen to it. "
"george"," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it"
"jerry"," Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene. 
            "
"jerry"," It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. 
              I've got to go. "
"kramer"," Read another poem."
"kramer"," Wow, that is great. You should be published. "
"kramer"," You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's 
              closed."
"kramer"," HELLO!"
"kramer"," HELLO!"
"elaine"," Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't 
              be good "
"jerry"," Maybe you're getting' a raise. "
"elaine"," Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie."
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," It's George"
"elaine"," George is on his way up."
"jerry"," Wait 'til I tell him about the book."
"kramer"," &lt;reading&gt; sobs"
"elaine"," Are you OK? What? What?"
"kramer"," It's marion's poetry. I can't take it &lt;leaves sobbing&gt;"
"elaine"," Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT"
"jerry"," I'm right here."
"elaine"," Remember that Columbus book? "
"jerry"," Columbus, Euro trash."
"george"," Well, it's definetly him. "
"elaine"," Him? Him who?"
"george"," Him who? Hayman him."
"elaine"," Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?"
"george"," Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. 
              I sat down "
"jerry"," That was double overtime."
"george"," So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, 
              ... "" He doesn't move. "
"elaine"," At least it wasn't atomic."
"george"," It was."
"jerry"," So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER"
"george"," How should I know?"
"jerry"," Because I gave it to you. "
"george"," Me?"
"jerry"," Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to 
              see it then finally "
"george"," The locker room!"
"jerry"," Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything 
              happen to it. "
"george"," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, 
              no problem."
"jerry"," All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's 
              hygiene. "
"george"," Yes Mr. Hayman."
"george"," Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts."
"george"," I'm not really sure, I..."
"jerry"," Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings."
"jerry"," What is your problem?"
"jerry","  That is one tough monkey! &lt;turns 
              to Elaine&gt; "
"elaine"," Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's 
              poems. "
"jerry"," Oh, beautiful did he like them? "
"elaine"," No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!"
"jerry"," &lt;to George&gt; Was he out there?"
"george"," Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him. "
"jerry"," I guess we'll never know."
"kramer"," Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.<br/>
<br/>
              JERRY Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.<br/>
<br/>
              KRAMER Buddy Hackett?<br/>
<br/>
              JERRY He's a comedian.<br/>
<br/>
              KRAMER I know.<br/>
<br/>
              JERRY All right. All right.<br/>
<br/>
              KRAMER  You can go over here.<br/>
<br/>
              JERRY I can manage.<br/>
<br/>
              KRAMER  George! "
"kramer"," It's purple 23. Remember that. "
"george"," She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women 
        don't like nice. "
"jerry"," This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant 
        since it opened. Poor guy. "
"george"," Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, 
        when nice is bad? "
"jerry"," What's that smell? What are you wearing? "
"george"," Little cologne. "
"jerry"," Manly. "
"george"," Monica wants me to wear it. "
"jerry"," So why didn't you say no? "
"george"," I'm too nice. "
"jerry"," Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send 
        back money. This is horrible. "
"george"," She wants me to take an IQ test. "
"jerry"," That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne. "
"george"," No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's 
        part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig. "
"jerry"," I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody. "
"george"," You know, I can't talk to you anymore. "
"jerry"," All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test. "
"george"," Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think 
        I'm smart, but I'm not smart. "
"jerry"," Who thinks you're smart? "
"george"," I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing. "
"jerry"," What thing? "
"george"," You don't listen when people talk to you anymore! "
"jerry"," Oh, the IQ thing...yeah. "
"george"," I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores 
        for 15 years. "
"jerry"," What did you get? "
"george"," What did I get or what do I say I got? "
"jerry"," What do you say? "
"george"," I say fourteen o nine . "
"jerry"," 1409, that's a good score. "
"george"," You're telling me. "
"jerry"," What did you really get? "
"george"," You are my friend. "
"jerry"," Of course. "
"george"," I tell you everything, right? "
"jerry"," I hope so. "
"george"," Well, this I take to the grave. "
"jerry"," He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. 
        That's why no one is going in. "
"elaine"," Why do you keep watching? "
"jerry"," I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the 
        toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going 
        to make it, you kind of root it for awhile. "
"elaine"," And then you flush. "
"jerry"," Well, it's a spider. "
"elaine"," You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't 
        see anyone else in there. "
"elaine"," You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying. 
      "
"jerry"," Bazooka Joe. "
"jerry"," The buzzer. "
"elaine"," It's your house. "
"jerry"," My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? 
      "
"jerry"," Come on up. "
"elaine"," Casus belli. "
"jerry"," What's that? "
"elaine"," It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted 
        to say it out loud. "
"jerry"," Go in, go in! "
"elaine"," Have you gone in there? "
"jerry"," No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners 
        with him. "
"george"," Hi. "
"jerry"," You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us 
        both a favor. "
"george"," I'm wearing some cologne, all right? "
"elaine"," Sure, fine. "
"jerry"," Casus belli. "
"elaine"," Casus belli. "
"george"," What's that? "
"elaine"," Since when do you wear cologne? "
"george"," Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal 
        point of attention? Let me just be, let me live. "
"jerry"," Hey, how did you do on that IQ test? "
"george"," I didn't take it yet. "
"elaine"," What IQ test? "
"george"," What's casus belli. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's nothing... "
"george"," Is it about me? "
"jerry"," Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't 
        you just be? Why can't you live? "
"elaine"," It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, 
        what is this test? "
"jerry"," This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for 
        this course. "
"elaine"," Oh, that sounds like fun. "
"george"," Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. "
"elaine"," You'll do well, you're smart. "
"jerry"," No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not. 
      "
"elaine"," What did you get on your SAT's? "
"george"," It varies. "
"jerry"," You know, I don't even know my IQ. "
"elaine"," Mine's 145. "
"george"," 145! "
"jerry"," Get out of here! "
"elaine"," You get out of here! "
"jerry"," You get out of here! "
"george"," You should take the test for me. "
"jerry"," Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember 
        in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became 
        a legend after that. "
"george"," Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we 
        do that again? "
"elaine"," What? "
"george"," You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out 
        the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor. "
"elaine"," Are you serious? "
"george"," Why not? "
"elaine"," Where would I take the test? "
"george"," I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here 
        or go to the coffee shop. "
"elaine"," No, that would be too noisy. "
"jerry"," Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep. "
"elaine"," Hey, what do you think? "
"jerry"," Hey, I love a good caper. "
"elaine"," Yeah, that's what is is, a caper. "
"george"," You'll do it? "
"elaine"," What the hey. "
"george"," Yeaah, beautiful... Sorry... "
"jerry"," Well, I've been looking forward to it. "
"jerry"," Eh, people, people are talking. "
"jerry"," Non smoking would be great. "
"jerry"," Thank you.  "
"jerry"," Well, what do you recommend my good fellow? "
"jerry"," Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment 
        here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many 
        years. "
"george"," You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. "
"george"," I can't concentrate in front of you. "
"george"," Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring 
        a persons intelligence. "
"george"," Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse 
        me, I would like to get started please. "
"george"," Don't need it. "
"elaine"," What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 
        minutes. "
"george"," I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing 
        this. "
"elaine"," All right, what time do you want me back here. "
"george"," Eh, twenty to three. "
"elaine"," Ok. "
"george"," Thanks again. "
"elaine"," All right. "
"george"," And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. 
      "
"jerry"," Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur 
        I must say. "
"jerry"," Oh, please... "
"elaine"," Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast. "
"jerry"," Eat something! Babu... "
"elaine"," Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni. "
"jerry"," Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. "
"elaine"," I know. "
"kramer"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Hey. "
"kramer"," Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... "
"elaine"," Hey. "
"kramer"," This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. 
        Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket 
        back. "
"jerry"," So? "
"kramer"," Well, I'm not giving it back. "
"jerry"," Why not? "
"kramer"," Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're 
        attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him? "
"kramer"," Oh, gees... "
"elaine"," Yeah, ok... "
"kramer"," Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of 
        limitations on that? "
"jerry"," Statute. "
"kramer"," What? "
"jerry"," Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. "
"kramer"," No, statue. "
"jerry"," Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. "
"kramer"," Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it 
        statue or statute of limitations? "
"elaine"," Statute. "
"kramer"," Oh, I really think you're wrong. "
"elaine"," Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long 
        of time. "
"kramer"," What test? "
"elaine"," An IQ test. "
"kramer"," Why do you take an IQ test? "
"elaine"," It's for George. "
"kramer"," George? "
"elaine"," Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later? "
"kramer"," Why are you taking an IQ test for George? "
"elaine"," Would you please?! "
"kramer"," What, is it for a job or something? "
"elaine"," Later! "
"kramer"," You're positive it's statute? "
"elaine"," Yes, yes! "
"george"," Yeah? "
"george"," Oh, it's locked? "
"george"," Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. "
"george"," Wish I could. "
"elaine"," Babu! If you don't mind? "
"elaine"," Oh my God! It's all over the test! "
"elaine"," Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway. "
"jerry"," Go ahead, I'll take care of it. "
"jerry"," It's all right, she was cheating anyway. "
"jerry"," Babu, you're Pakistani? "
"jerry"," Babu, may I say something? "
"jerry"," I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that 
        perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed 
        to franks and beans for example. "
"jerry"," Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant 
        in the whole neighborhood. "
"jerry"," Well, not everything. I do what I can. "
"elaine"," It was an accident. "
"george"," What did you go on a picnic? "
"elaine"," Babu Bhatt did it. "
"george"," Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? "
"george"," Ok.  Here you go. "
"george"," Piece of cake. "
"george"," What? I spilled some food on it. "
"george"," What are you talking about? "
"george"," From my pocket. "
"george"," I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. "
"george"," Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. "
"george"," Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, 
        from the grocery store. "
"george"," I walked. "
"george"," I climbed out the window. "
"george"," Of course. "
"george"," The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here. 
      "
"jerry"," Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not 
        me. "
"elaine"," You're very special. "
"kramer"," Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell 
        him you don't know where I am. "
"jerry"," Of course, I always do. "
"kramer"," No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 
      "
"elaine"," Just give it back to him. "
"kramer"," Oh, he'll have to kill me.  "
"jerry"," Hey Georgie! "
"george"," Coming up. "
"jerry"," How did you do on the IQ test?! "
"george"," 85! "
"jerry"," What?!! "
"george"," 85, Jerry! 85 IQ ! "
"elaine"," 85? "
"jerry"," Well, well, well... "
"elaine"," He's coming up? "
"jerry"," Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should 
        be here in a few seconds. "
"elaine"," Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous. "
"jerry"," Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions 
        about hunting and testicles... "
"george"," Oh, hello professor. "
"elaine"," George, I cannot believe... "
"george"," Please... "
"elaine"," No there has got be a mistake. "
"george"," You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father 
        gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. "
"jerry"," But an 85? "
"elaine"," There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's 
        name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate. "
"elaine"," Jerry! It was! Let me take it again. "
"george"," Whow, forget it. "
"elaine"," Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose? 
      "
"george"," You could do worst! "
"elaine"," No, no, I guarantee it. "
"george"," All right, I'll ask her. "
"elaine"," Ok, now where I'm going to take it. "
"jerry"," Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions. "
"jerry"," Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the 
        grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week. "
"jerry"," I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm. "
"jerry"," Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen 
        and tell your chef I want the works. "
"elaine"," What are you doing? "
"kramer"," Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. "
"elaine"," What's going on? "
"elaine"," Why did you come in here for? "
"kramer"," I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live. "
"elaine"," Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out 
        of here. "
"kramer"," I thought you took the test. "
"elaine"," I had to take it again. "
"kramer"," How come? "
"elaine"," What's the difference?!! "
"kramer"," Well, you can't leave now. "
"elaine"," What? "
"kramer"," Never! "
"george"," How' you doing? "
"george"," You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again 
        to get a cup of coffee... "
"jerry"," Babu? Babu... Babu...you know, I 
        got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's 
        a little stringy. You have any chicken? "
"jerry"," Well, maybe your refrigerator... "
"jerry"," You know, I think I'll just take the check. "
"elaine"," Well eh, kind of.... "
"elaine"," Oh. "
"elaine"," Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go. "
"elaine"," Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't

        The"
"george"," Wow. What'd you say?"

"george"," Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand"
"jerry"," You got something in your teeth there."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," It's green."
"george"," Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all"

"george"," Ok, thanks."
"jerry"," What do you need a job, you got Audrey."
"george"," Yeah, right."
"jerry"," What's the matter?"
"george"," Oh, nothing."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," You won't think I'm a bad person?"
"jerry"," Too late for that."
"george"," 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a"
"jerry"," Yeah, she's got a big nose."
"george"," I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big."
"jerry"," It's a schnoz."
"george"," Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a 
        little"
"jerry"," A little."
"george"," So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should 
        be"
"jerry"," Stop being so concerned with looks."
"jerry"," Have you said anything to her about it?"
"george"," I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had 
        a"
"jerry"," Alright, shut up, here they come."
"kramer"," So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in 
        her house"
"elaine"," Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?"
"kramer"," No no, he's never met her. She's in California."
"elaine"," Are you coming with me?"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand."
"george"," Why don't you just commit yourself already?"
"elaine"," He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women."
"kramer"," Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm 
        going"
"george"," What, you didn't wash all day?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women 
        at"
"kramer"," Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job."
"elaine"," Kramer!"
"kramer"," What? What?"
"elaine"," How could you say something like that?!"
"kramer"," What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job."
"elaine"," No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey."
"elaine"," What did you have to say that for?"
"kramer"," Well, I was just trying to help out."
"elaine"," Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin. 
      "
"kramer"," You see what happens when you try to be nice?"
"george"," Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?"
"george"," Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind.  "
"george"," They way he just says stuff."
"george"," Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character."
"george"," About the pizza?"
"george"," Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?"
"george"," Yeah.  Not that I care, one way or the other, 
        but"
"george"," Peter Jennings had one."
"george"," Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating 
        class"
"george"," It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist."
"george"," It's a cleaning."
"george"," If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will 
        tell you"
"george"," What the hell."
"george"," Me? I didn't say anything."
"elaine"," You encouraged her to get one."
"george"," I didn't encourage. No encourage."
"elaine"," Peter Jennings had one?"
"george"," It's possible."
"elaine"," Well, I think you should accept her for who she is."
"elaine"," I think it's a mistake."
"george"," Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one."
"george"," I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it."
"jerry"," Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad 
        dudes."
"jerry"," We have time."
"george"," It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face."
"jerry"," It is exciting."
"george"," Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but..."
"jerry"," Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have 
        ever"
"george"," You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty."
"jerry"," Then what?"
"george"," He still wins but it's not a blowout."
"jerry"," She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting"
"jerry"," So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey."
"george"," Good for you."
"jerry"," I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean 
        it was"
"george"," It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and 
        not"
"jerry"," It's not like that at all."
"elaine"," How do you even know the jacket is there?"
"kramer"," Well I don't, I'm guessing."
"george"," Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember 
        that"
"george"," Yeah?"
"jerry"," Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road."
"elaine"," Are you sure you want us here for this?"
"jerry"," Shouldn't a doctor do it?"
"george"," Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth."
"elaine"," It looks good."
"jerry"," Great job."
"kramer"," You got butchered."
"jerry"," Let's put him over here."
"kramer"," Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you."
"elaine"," How ya feeling?"
"george"," Too much salt in my diet."
"elaine"," Can I get you anything?"
"george"," Nah, I'm good."
"elaine"," You sure? Anything?"
"george"," Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?"
"elaine"," No, it didn't. No, it didn't."
"george"," It's like, all dented."
"elaine"," Seems to be."
"george"," Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern"
"elaine"," Shut up, George."
"george"," Shut up?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," Interesting."
"jerry"," Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!"
"kramer"," I don't have it, I threw it out."
"jerry"," You're lying! You got it, I want that number!"
"kramer"," I told you, I threw it out."
"jerry"," Give it to me!"
"kramer"," You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise."
"jerry"," Well, I changed my mind, I want that number."
"kramer"," You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the 
        number."
"jerry"," I was lying, give it to me!"
"kramer"," No, you told me not to!"
"jerry"," I want that number!"
"kramer"," Alright!  Yeah! 
        Yeah! "
"george"," Yeah."
"george"," Oh, I got it."
"george"," Yeah, phew."
"george"," What?"
"george"," We did?"
"george"," Hawaii?"
"george"," Oh yeah. My friend lived there."
"george"," You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on 
        a plane"
"jerry"," I'm Nelson!"
"jerry"," Alright, alright, I'm sorry.  Nothing's changed, Alma, 
        I just"
"jerry"," Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun."
"elaine"," You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey 
        to"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Wait wait wait wait wait.  
        Here."
"elaine"," What do I need this for?"
"kramer"," Because we're engaged."
"elaine"," We're engaged?"
"kramer"," Um hm."
"elaine"," Kramer, this is too big."
"elaine"," Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My 
        father"
"kramer"," Yes, yes I am."
"kramer"," Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing."
"kramer"," My contention?"
"kramer"," Yes, that's my contention."
"elaine"," I heard him contend that."
"elaine"," Oh, it was a frame-up."
"elaine"," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
"kramer"," She does fine work."
"elaine"," How kind of you."
"jerry"," Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working."
"elaine"," Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe."
"elaine"," My father, really? I had no idea."
"kramer"," You don't say?"
"elaine"," I found it!"
"kramer"," So I grabbed the guy by the collar."
"elaine"," Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"""
"jerry"," So I assume the jig was up."
"elaine"," Yeah, pretty much."
"elaine"," Hi!"
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine"," So, will I see you later tonight?"
"kramer"," Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge."
"jerry"," I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to 
              work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing 
              there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. 
              I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger 
              knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. 
              I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
              like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking 
              for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack 
              away with. Do you have anything like that? "
"jerry"," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about."
"george"," Like you do."
"jerry"," Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft 
              and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?"
"george"," What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed 
              it together like a coffee table?"
"jerry"," I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't 
              it?"
"george"," Why did France give that to us anyway?"
"jerry"," It was a gift."
"george"," So countries just exchange gifts like that?"
"jerry"," If they like each other. "
"george"," There's Elaine. "
"jerry"," See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend."
"george"," Really? They work here in the office?"
"jerry"," Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything. 
            "
"george"," Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing 
              better to talk about."
"jerry"," You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic."
"george"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years."
"george"," ""Off the wagon""?"
"jerry"," I think it's off the wagon."
"george"," I think it's ""on the wagon""."
"elaine"," Jerry, George, what are you doing here?"
"jerry"," What am I doing here? Ba-boom "
"elaine"," *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! "
"jerry"," Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good 
              for you."
"elaine"," Where did you find it?"
"jerry"," Under the sofa cushion."
"elaine"," And you stopped by just to give it to me?"
"jerry"," It's your Christmas present."
"elaine"," I though I'd never find it."
"george"," Well today's your lucky day."
"elaine"," No. Today's *your* lucky day."
"george"," It will be my first one."
"elaine"," You want to work here?"
"george"," Huh?"
"elaine"," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. 
              Dick, this is Jerry and this is George."
"jerry"," ""The guy?"""
"elaine","  Dick."
"george"," How can you just get it?"
"elaine"," My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All 
              you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold 
              my drink. "
"jerry"," Cranberry juice?"
"elaine"," And vodka."
"jerry"," So... I'm Jerry. "
"george"," Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff."
"george"," I like Mike Lubika."
"george"," He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very 
              insightful..."
"george"," Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because 
              I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out. "
"george"," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay."
"george"," He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village. "
"george"," Venetian Blinds."
"jerry"," Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football. 
            "
"elaine"," Where's my drink?"
"jerry"," There.  So, how did it go?"
"george"," I think he was impressed. "
"elaine"," No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice. "
"jerry"," Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours."
"elaine"," Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to 
              hold it."
"jerry"," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold 
              it."
"elaine"," One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon."
"george"," Told you."
"jerry"," I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel 
              like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress."
"george"," Do I really have to buy her something?"
"jerry"," Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy 
              her a gift. How about this?"
"george"," What is that? Is that cashmere?"
"jerry"," Yeah. She would love cashmere."
"george"," Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world 
              that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive."
"jerry"," Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600."
"george"," Wow. Excuse me, Miss?"
"george"," How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?"
"george"," What? I don't see anything."
"george"," Oh yeah."
"jerry"," Oh it's damaged. "
"george","  Well it's not really damaged. 
              85 dollars huh?"
"george"," You think she would care about the red dot?"
"jerry"," It's hard to say. "
"george"," I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?"
"jerry"," Well I can see it."
"george"," Yeah, but you know where it is."
"jerry"," Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?"
"george"," Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?"
"jerry"," It's hard to pretend because I know where it is."
"george"," Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview? 
            "
"jerry"," You want me to take an overview?"
"george"," Please."
"jerry"," I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away 
              with something. That's my overview."
"jerry"," Yeah so?"
"elaine"," He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking 
              again."
"jerry"," Oh boy, can you smell it?"
"elaine"," No. I can't smell it."
"jerry"," Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking."
"elaine"," You don't always smell someone from a drink."
"jerry"," Yes you do."
"elaine"," What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?"
"jerry"," Yes you would."
"jerry"," I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor? "
"kramer"," Okay."
"jerry"," Would you take a drink and let us smell you?"
"kramer"," You can smell me without the drink."
"elaine"," I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but 
              I can't smell it. "
"kramer"," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?"
"jerry"," I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. 
              It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner."
"kramer"," All right."
"jerry"," I don't smell anything."
"elaine"," Maybe we're too close to the bottle."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george","  It's George."
"jerry"," Come on up."
"kramer"," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for 
              this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords 
              you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots 
              of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk 
              all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch."
"george"," Hello everybody."
"kramer"," Hey.  I'm going to tell 
              you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going 
              to tell you. I think that you are terrific. "
"george","  Thank you."
"elaine"," Hey what's that?"
"george"," It's an early Christmas present."
"elaine"," Christmas present? For who?"
"george"," For you."
"elaine"," *gasp*  Get out of here. "
"kramer"," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. 
              Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose 
              as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, 
              why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n..."
"jerry"," Kramer. Yeah that'll do."
"elaine","  Oh George, this is beautiful. Is 
              this cashmere?"
"george"," Of course it's cashmere."
"elaine"," Oh, I love cashmere. "
"george"," Well who doesn't."
"elaine"," My, George this must have cost a fortune."
"george"," Ahh, money."
"elaine"," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?"
"jerry"," I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people 
              happy."
"elaine"," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever 
              given me."
"george"," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out 
              already. It's for special occasions this thing."
"kramer"," What's that red dot on your sweater?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it."
"elaine"," Uhh. This. It's like a red dot."
"george"," What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here 
              for a second. Do you see anything here?"
"jerry","  Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know."
"elaine"," What don't you know?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"elaine"," Well do you see it or don't you?"
"jerry"," Ahem. Say that again?"
"elaine"," Do you see it or don't you?"
"jerry"," Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question."
"jerry"," Now what did you ask me again."
"elaine"," You're still here. You're a dynamo."
"george"," I can't believe I get paid for this."
"elaine"," I'll see you tomorrow."
"george"," How you doing?"
"jerry"," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are 
              you, how did you do that?"
"george"," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning 
              woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning 
              women, chambermaids."
"jerry"," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too."
"george"," Why is that?"
"jerry"," It's a woman in your room. So go ahead."
"george"," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, 
              her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... "
"jerry"," Convulsing?"
"george"," Convulsing?"
"jerry"," I don't know, I'm trying to help you."
"george"," Then I asked her if she wanted a drink."
"jerry"," You don't drink."
"george"," I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to 
              her."
"jerry"," So you started drinking."
"george"," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know 
              if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew 
              she was mopping the floor with me."
"jerry"," So how was it?"
"george"," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
"jerry"," Good thing the cleaning lady was there."
"elaine"," Dick was fired."
"jerry"," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over 
              to the right, and none of this would have happened."
"elaine"," You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down 
              at all?"
"jerry"," What are you saying?"
"elaine"," I'm not saying anything."
"jerry"," You're saying something."
"elaine"," What could I be saying?"
"jerry"," Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something."
"elaine"," If I was saying something I would have said it."
"jerry"," Well why don't you say it?"
"elaine"," I said it."
"jerry"," What did you say?"
"elaine"," Nothing. It's exhausting being with you."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"george","  It's George."
"jerry"," Come on up."
"elaine"," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy 
              that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? 
               Ooookay, you just gave me the answer."
"jerry"," No I didn't."
"elaine"," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression."
"jerry"," I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I 
              have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe."
"elaine"," How much did he save?"
"jerry"," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question 
               of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could 
              even think of that. That's what you were seeing."
"george"," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning 
              the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. 
              She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, 
              I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
"jerry"," Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. 
              She's asking me all kinds of questions."
"george"," Did you tell her anything?"
"jerry"," No."
"george"," Do you swear?"
"jerry"," I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear."
"george"," Oh you told her didn't you."
"jerry"," No."
"elaine"," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot 
              was on it because you could get it at a discount?"
"george"," What? Did I what?"
"elaine"," You did didn't you."
"george"," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in 
              the spirit of the season  and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful 
              Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you 
              at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas."
"elaine"," Well Jerry told me that you did."
"george"," You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to 
              say anything."
"jerry"," I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you."
"george"," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when 
              I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. 
              I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
              distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. 
              I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time.  I mean look, I have no clothes, look 
              at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot."
"george"," This is for you."
"george"," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that 
              you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. 
              What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. "
"george"," Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like 
              this very much."
"george"," Of course it's cashemere."
"george"," Just a little something for Christmas."
"george"," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on 
              now, try it on later."
"george"," Take it off. You're going to ruin it."
"jerry"," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand 
              blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like 
              the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but 
              I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to 
              spend as much time as you can."
"jerry"," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and 
              gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not 
              my fault you're back on the wagon."
"jerry"," In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from 
              town to town?"
"jerry"," On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of 
              those bottles along the way?"
"jerry"," They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?"
"jerry"," I know enough not to get on them."
"george"," Who said that?"
"george"," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you 
              I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said 
              anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of 
              thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of 
              offices and I tell you peope do that all the time."
"george"," Well you didn't have to say it like that."
"george"," What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability 
              there?"
"elaine"," You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman."
"george"," You never had sex in the office before?"
"elaine"," No. I once made out with someone but that was it."
"george"," Alright so you made out with someone."
"elaine"," Well that's not sex."
"george"," Kissing is sex."
"elaine"," Kissing is not sex."
"jerry"," George?"
"george"," Jerry."
"elaine"," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," George?"
"george"," Over here."
"elaine"," What are you doing here?"
"jerry"," I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up."
"elaine"," Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?"
"jerry"," I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance."
"elaine"," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's 
              on purpose."
"jerry"," Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night."
"elaine"," Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear."
"george"," Hide, hide under the desk."
"elaine"," Ow, ow move over."
"jerry"," Get off of me."
"elaine"," I've got no room."
"george"," Of course it's cashmere."
"jerry"," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into 
              an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either 
              telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And 
              those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think 
              he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's 
              finally off the wagon."
"jerry"," Don't get smart.

"kramer"," I just joined the Polar Bear Club."
"jerry"," You joined the *Polar Bears*?!"
"george"," What the Hell is a ""Polar Bear""?"
"kramer"," Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. 
              They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's 
              invigorating...."

              I know..."
"jerry"," You think they have fleas there, don't you?"
"george"," *No*..."
"jerry"," Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and 
              you "
"george"," All right, I think they have fleas there. So what..."
"jerry"," They have a piano backstage they warm up on."
"jerry"," What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come 
              out?"
"george"," I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't 
              applaud "
"jerry","  I resent that you said that! That's"
"jerry"," Is this okay? Can I do this? "
"elaine"," Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser 
              on my leg and I "
"elaine"," We did. We're just hanging out. "
"elaine"," Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel? 
            "
"elaine"," Have you thought about an intervention?"
"elaine"," You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to 
              try to get"
"george"," What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the 
              first "
"jerry"," I dunno, it was an impulse."
"george"," What kind of a sick impulse does that??"
"jerry"," How could I know she would start to laugh?"
"jerry"," Can we just go in already?"
"george"," What are we gonna tell her?"
"george"," No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, 
              then "
"jerry"," What about?"
"george"," Hey, hey! We're discussing something!"
"jerry"," I know, but I'm distracted now."
"george"," What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her."
"jerry"," Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the 
              Comedy Club. How's he doing?"
"elaine"," He's good. "
"george"," Uh, can we cut to the chase?"
"jerry"," ""Cut to the chase""?"
"george"," Yeah..."
"jerry"," What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?"
"george"," A lot of people say it."
"jerry"," I would lose that."
"george","  What's *that*?"
"jerry"," ""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!"
"george","  ...Yes it is."
"elaine"," Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from"
"jerry"," Really, an intervention ..."
"george"," Y'know people, we got a situation over here!"
"elaine"," Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it."
"jerry"," Me? Why me?"
"elaine"," 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to 
              you."
"jerry"," Y'know these things are *really* hard to load..."
"george"," All right, OK, I'm goin' in."
"jerry"," We've got to talk about this "
"elaine"," All right."
"george"," Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful."
"george"," Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
"jerry"," You play a *Hell* of a piano."
"elaine"," Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved."
"elaine"," Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you."
"jerry"," Pez?"
"george"," Me, uh, uh, no, ..."
"jerry"," Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort 
              of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that 
              rude and ignorant."
"elaine"," Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her 
              leg."
"jerry"," Even if this so called mental defective did put something 
              on her leg she's still the one who laughed."
"elaine"," I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody 
              is holding her back against every fibre in her being."
"george"," If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being 
              she'll be very careful "
"george"," All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something 
              to eat."
"jerry"," We'll be outside"
"elaine"," Yeah"
"jerry"," It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your 
              fingers before you play?"
"george"," We'll have a good time"
"george"," Ah, come on"
"george"," Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and 
              we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is 
              fine ok, uh, fine, .. "
"jerry"," You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for 
              getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place."
"elaine"," What? How?"
"jerry"," A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer 
              was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. 
            "
"elaine"," So? What happened? "
"jerry"," What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing 
              out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, "
"elaine"," Shut up! "
"jerry"," All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners 
              nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same."
"elaine"," Whar about Kramer?"
"jerry"," He's the same!"
"jerry"," Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in 
              two years. I don't have a good apartment for "
"kramer","  Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade 
              that killed Marty Benson? "
"jerry"," Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention 
              for him. We're having it here. "
"kramer"," Can I get in on that?"
"jerry"," What do you think? It's like a poker game?"
"kramer"," Is Elaine going?"
"jerry"," Yeah"
"kramer"," Well, I knew him as well as she did."
"jerry"," Yeah, but John invited her."
"kramer"," So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"
"jerry"," No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid 
              you might be interfering while we're intervening. "
"george"," It's George"
"jerry"," Stop smelling your arm."
"kramer"," You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You 
              spray it on and you smell like you just "
"jerry"," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe 
              I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
"kramer"," Tell me about it!"
"jerry"," Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing 
              department at Calvin Klein. "
"george"," Well it's over. It's definitely over. "
"jerry"," She broke up with you?"
"george"," No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had 
              this terrible phone conversation. "
"jerry"," What was on the list?"
"george"," Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my 
              car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink, "
"jerry"," Yeah, Postum is under-ratted, "
"george"," Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted 
              to go out to dinner and she said "
"jerry"," What's wrong with lunch?"
"george"," Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. 
              you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. "
"kramer"," I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?"
"george"," I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have 
              no hand."
"kramer"," Break up with her "
"george"," What?"
"kramer"," You break up with her. You reverse everything that way."
"jerry"," A preemptive breakup. "
"george"," A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got 
              nothing to lose. "
"george"," So, I am have to going to break up with you."
"george"," I, ... am breaking up with, ... you."
"george"," Shocked?"
"george"," Never expected this did you?"
"george"," Well, live and learn."
"george"," Kind of."
"george"," Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid."
"george"," Now, stop it ..."
"george"," When you're playing the piano do you think about me?"
"george"," This is what I'm talking about."
"george"," All the time."
"george"," I can't hear you."
"george"," See, It's not so hard. "
"kramer"," Go ahead smell, smell"
"kramer"," Do you recognize it? ... The beach."
"kramer"," Oh, I'm talking about the beach."
"kramer"," You know the way you smell when you first come home from 
              the beach?"
"kramer"," Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
"kramer"," So you don't think it's a good idea? "
"elaine","  Uh, you have to work like that? "
"jerry"," In the freezer."
"jerry"," Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes."
"jerry"," Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking."
"elaine"," What's the order?"
"elaine"," Albano is your last name."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Is this the interference?"
"jerry"," Intervention."
"kramer"," Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?"
"kramer"," I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade 
            "
"kramer"," Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for 
              me, big mouth."
"kramer"," Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies."
"jerry"," No, we're having an intervention"
"jerry"," There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront 
              him."
"elaine"," Hide!"
"jerry"," It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah "
"george"," It's George"
"jerry"," Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him."
"elaine"," Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
"elaine"," You're getting warm."
"george"," We just came from Chadway's What's going on."
"jerry"," We're having the intervention for Richie."
"george"," Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?"
"jerry"," Well, uh.."
"elaine"," Oh, hi Noel"
"jerry"," Well, you're looking well."
"george"," Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand 
              is not a man."" "
"george","  This man is a genius. Genius!"
"george"," I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to 
              talk to you"
"elaine"," "
"elaine"," "
"elaine"," No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. 
              It was Jerry."
"jerry"," I didn't know she would laugh."
"george"," No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you 
              going?"
"george"," You can't break up with me. I've got hand."
"jerry"," Hey Richie"
"jerry"," It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, 
              He's hostile, he's"
"george"," I can't do these puzzles. "
"jerry"," So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the 
              coffee table "
"george"," Ah ah Pez dispenser."
"jerry"," He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized 
              by it. Then he's"
"george"," Well they're hard to load."
"jerry"," Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying 
              to load it he loses control"
"george"," Poor kid."
"jerry"," So as he's telling the story he starts crying. "
"george"," What did you do?"
"jerry"," What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser."
"george"," Wow"
"jerry"," Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked 
              to the doctor yesterday."
"george"," What's a three letter word for candy?"
"jerry"," I can't do those things."
"jerry"," Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you 
        think that would have a negative effect on his life?"
"elaine"," Na."
"jerry"," What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes."
"elaine"," Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three 
        days?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Its George."
"jerry"," Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast 
        for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?"
"elaine"," I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could 
        have given me ulcers?"
"jerry"," I think Ill take out the garbage."
"elaine"," Hey, have you ever fasted?"
"jerry"," Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, 
        that was pretty rough.  
        Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me."
"george"," Yeah, right."
"jerry"," Come on, its just down the hall."
"george"," Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks."
"jerry"," Ill give you 50 cents."
"george"," Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars."
"jerry"," Come on. Fifty cents. &lt;??&gt; a piece of Drakes coffee 
        cake"
"george"," Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty 
        cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to 
        the Cayman Islands this Friday."
"jerry"," I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What 
        do you need a break from getting up at eleven?"
"george"," Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont 
        come with me."
"jerry"," Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant 
        commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline."
"jerry"," Hi."
"jerry"," Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?"
"jerry"," How much do they cost?"
"george"," No, no the full size."
"jerry"," No, no the junior."
"george"," You didnt say ""junior""."
"jerry"," Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! 
         How ya doing?"
"jerry"," Boy shes sexy isnt she?"
"jerry"," Do you believe that guy?"
"elaine"," What guy?"
"jerry"," My neighbour"
"elaine"," Oh, that creepy guy?"
"jerry"," Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?"
"george"," He didnt seem too pleased."
"elaine"," Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings."
"george"," hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream 
        about that guy last night. This is amazing. "
"jerry"," Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before."
"george"," I havent seen him for months."
"jerry"," What was the dream?"
"george"," I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night 
        club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics 
        off."
"jerry"," I think Ive played there."
"george"," Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me."
"jerry"," Youre a little paranormal "
"elaine"," Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic."
"george"," Really?"
"elaine"," Uh uh, you should go some time. "
"george"," Id love to go. Make an appointment."
"jerry"," Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job? "
"george"," I just got fired."
"jerry"," Alright, come on, lets get out of here."
"elaine"," I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast."
"jerry"," I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits. "
"elaine"," Really?"
"jerry"," Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits. "
"jerry"," Who is it? Who is it?"
"jerry"," Who?"
"jerry"," Martine?"
"jerry"," Oh, Martin!"
"george"," Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill 
        himself with pills."
"jerry"," What? "
"jerry"," In my pajamas? I better get my robe."
"jerry"," Itll take two seconds."
"jerry"," We dont have two seconds?"
"jerry"," Nah, forget it."
"jerry"," Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas."
"jerry"," Are you sure?"
"jerry"," Nah, Ill go get the robe. "
"jerry"," Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow 
        comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime. "
"jerry"," Really? Its over?"
"jerry"," Oh boy, did he say anything about me?"
"jerry"," He said that?"
"jerry"," Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly. 
      "
"jerry"," You werent?"
"jerry"," Of course."
"jerry"," Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN."
"jerry"," I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries 
        today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this."
"jerry"," No, I just wanted to see what time it was. "
"jerry"," No."
"jerry"," Here?"
"jerry"," Is this the proper venue?"
"jerry"," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, 
        I pine to. "
"jerry"," I cant. What if he wakes up?"
"jerry"," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and 
        out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  
        you dont want to mess with it."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. "
"kramer"," Did you hear about Martin?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I heard."
"kramer"," I cant believe hes in a coma."
"kramer"," Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. 
        He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? "
"jerry"," Who told you about Martin?"
"kramer"," Newman! Hes good friends with him. "
"kramer"," Hes got all of my attachments, you know. "
"jerry"," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for 
        a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?"
"kramer"," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? "
"jerry"," You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres 
        no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their 
        lips around a revolver like a normal person? "
"kramer"," So whats going on between you and Gina?"
"jerry"," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night."
"kramer"," Uh, uh."
"jerry"," So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss 
        her right in front of him. "
"kramer"," Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean 
        women. All right, so what did you do?"
"jerry"," Nothing."
"kramer"," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma 
        and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? "
"jerry"," I didnt know what the coma etiquette was. "
"kramer"," There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of 
        the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it. "
"jerry"," So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its 
        all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim."
"kramer"," Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant 
        get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush."
"jerry"," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, 
        he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?"
"kramer"," NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum 
        cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it. "
"elaine"," Why would he come to George?"
"george"," I knew it. I always felt different. "
"george"," Drakes? "
"george"," Did you buy this for me?"
"george"," Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake."
"elaine"," Take it away."
"george"," She hasnt eaten in two days."
"george"," Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated 
        a woman named Pauline."
"george"," When I hear her name mentioned."
"george"," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose."
"george"," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she 
        ever speak to me again?"
"elaine"," Should you be smoking?"
"elaine"," Youre pregnant."
"george"," Elaine."
"george"," Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?"
"george"," You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to 
        happen to me? What?"
"elaine"," Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that."
"george"," Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going 
        to be. "
"george"," Should I not go on this trip?"
"elaine"," Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything 
        we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. "
"george"," Elaine, what are you doing?"
"elaine"," Its disgusting."
"elaine"," Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so 
        irresponsible."
"george"," If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane 
        crash."
"george"," Not a plane crash.  Is it a plane crash?"
"jerry"," You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if 
        Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. "
"jerry"," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie."
"jerry"," Theyre a comedy team."
"jerry"," Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit 
        each other a lot."
"jerry"," I will show you The Stooges."
"jerry"," Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now 
        but if I locate them you will be the first to know."
"jerry"," Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything 
        but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea 
        for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had 
        a lot of friends here."
"jerry"," Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my 
        closet?"
"jerry"," Yeah, all right. All right."
"kramer"," You should just eat fruit. "
"newman"," I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent."
"kramer"," ???"
"newman"," Hello Gina. Hello Jerry."
"jerry"," Hello Newman."
"jerry"," Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind 
        of sicko would do that? He could kill me."
"george"," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me."
"elaine","  Did you see that wall move?"
"jerry"," Boy, its a good thing we came."
"george"," Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres 
        native unrest."
"elaine"," Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much 
        longer it would be until I get my X-ray."
"jerry"," George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in 
        a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and 
        put it in storage. "
"george"," How come?"
"jerry"," Looters."
"elaine"," How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it? "
"jerry"," Shes really hungry."
"kramer"," Hey."
"elaine"," Kramer"
"kramer"," Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin. "
"george"," Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?"
"kramer"," Youre not going?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," Why not?"
"george"," The psychic said something terrible will happen."
"kramer"," I dig. "
"kramer"," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, 
        shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going 
        to kill me."
"kramer"," Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this 
        one?"
"kramer"," I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything. 
      "
"kramer"," The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American 
        public since One Hour Martinizing."
"kramer"," I wouldnt set foot in your house."
"jerry"," Hello."
"newman"," Hello Jerry."
"jerry"," Hows he doing? "
"kramer"," He looks happy to me."
"newman"," I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up."
"jerry"," Why wouldnt he?"
"newman"," No reason."
"jerry"," Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. "
"newman"," Ill bring him up to date."
"jerry"," How up to date?"
"newman"," Oh, all the way up."
"jerry"," And nothing could change your mind? "
"newman"," Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something 
        you earn."
"kramer"," Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands 
        for this weekend. Hes not going. "
"newman"," I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that 
        a,.."
"jerry"," Drakes Coffee Cake "
"newman"," Wow, where did you get that?"
"jerry"," From my house. I got a whole box of them. "
"newman"," Boy, thats the full size."
"jerry"," Thats your big boy."
"newman"," Can I have a bite?"
"jerry"," I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving 
        it for later. "
"newman"," Just one bite?"
"jerry"," I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile. 
      "
"newman"," All right! All right. I wont say anything. "
"jerry"," You swear?"
"newman"," I swear."
"jerry"," On your mothers life?"
"newman"," On my mothers life."
"kramer"," oh oh oh oh oh"
"newman"," Oooh, "
"elaine"," And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, 
        but juicy tender breasts of duck. "
"george"," sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart"
"george"," how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is 
        phenomenal. "
"george"," Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to 
        apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even 
        know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt 
        get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .."
"george"," I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont 
        you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember 
        the other day you were saying something about my trip. "
"george"," Yeah, why? Why? "
"george"," Because? Because?"
"elaine"," Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  
        Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that."
"newman"," Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell."
"jerry"," Elaine! No! No!"
"george"," Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? 
        Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?"
"newman"," He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you."
"kramer"," I want my vacuum cleaner!"
"jerry"," Hey!"
"newman"," It was disgusting."
"jerry"," What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes."
"george"," I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting. 
      "
"jerry"," What did she name the kid?"
"george"," You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin."
"kramer"," Heey!"
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"george"," when did you get back?"
"kramer"," A couple of hours ago."
"george"," So how was it?"
"kramer"," George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days 
        I ever spent in my life."
"jerry"," osh."
"kramer"," They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right 
        in the hotel pool."
"jerry"," Woah. "
"kramer"," Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the 
        beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down 
        there."
"jerry"," Wow! "
"kramer"," I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson "
"jerry"," Oh! "
"kramer"," We played Backgammon in the nude."
"jerry"," Oh! "
"kramer"," Shes a sweet kid."
"jerry"," Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!"
"kramer"," Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a 
        jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula 
        was trying to warn you about."
"george"," Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Whats this?"
"jerry"," Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and 
        Gina."
"kramer"," They moved in together?"
"jerry"," Yeah, its some place down in the village. "
"kramer"," Phew."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Its Elaine."
"jerry"," All right were coming down."
"kramer"," Hey, where ya going?"
"jerry"," Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the 
        fast again. Um, you want to go?"
"kramer"," Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well 
        be getting together."
"george"," Elle McPherson going to be there?"
"kramer"," OH! I got to call her back."
"george"," It's all departures. I see nothing but departures.  Do you know where the arrivals are?"
"george"," Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?"
"george"," Where?"
"george"," But you have a watch on."
"george"," Why don't you just look at your watch?"
"george"," Let me see the watch."
"george"," You know we're living in a society!"
"jerry"," George."
"george"," Jerry. Jerry."
"jerry"," Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?"
"george"," I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway."
"george"," One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,<br/>
        like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead."
"jerry"," So you have no car?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," So what good are you?"
"jerry"," I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,<br/>
        O'Brien's not showing up."
"george"," How do you know?"
"jerry"," He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him 
        on the<br/>
        plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden."
"george"," We should take his limo."
"jerry"," Yeah, right."
"george"," Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till 
        you<br/>
        see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's 
        in<br/>
        Chicago."
"jerry"," He's definitely in Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well the guy's just standing there.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry How would we do it?<br/>
<br/>
        George We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien.""<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Maybe he knows O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
        George No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have 
        a<br/>
        sign. Let's just do it.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What if we get caught?<br/>
<br/>
        George What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Who's gonna be O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
        George I'll be O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Who am I?<br/>
<br/>
        George You're you.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Just me?<br/>
<br/>
        George Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Okay.<br/>
<br/>
        George What, you don't want to be you?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?<br/>
<br/>
        George Like who?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Dylan Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George mumbles something.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        George Well I like Dylan.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry You could be Colin.<br/>
<br/>
        George Colin O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I'm Dylan Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George I'm Colin O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        They walk towards the chauffer.<br/>
<br/>
        George Are we really doing this?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Come on,<br/>
<br/>
        Man  Hey, do you have the time?<br/>
<br/>
        George Clock over there.  O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer Yes sir.<br/>
<br/>
        George Sorry we're late.<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer Here let me take that for you.<br/>

        George Oh thank you.<br/>

        New scene.<br/>
        George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.<br/>
<br/>
        George This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever 
        done<br/>
        in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What for?<br/>
<br/>
        George I dunno, I'm in a limo.  Hello ma? It's me. Guess where 
        I am. <br/>
        In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell 
        you<br/>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop<br/>
        it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? 
        I'm<br/>
        *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry She happy for you?<br/>
<br/>
        George Can he hear us?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry No. Why?<br/>
<br/>
        George I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry He can't hear us.<br/>
<br/>
        George Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick 
        up<br/>
        your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at 
        my<br/>
        house?<br/>
<br/>
        George We'll ask him.  My dear fellow, where are you<br/>
        dropping us?<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.<br/>
<br/>
        George Of course, the uh, the four passes.  Four passes 
        to<br/>
        Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! 
        <br/>
        The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What?<br/>
<br/>
        George We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry We're going to the Knick game!<br/>
<br/>
        George Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!<br/>
<br/>
        George You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, 
        wait,<br/>
        you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do 
        you see<br/>
        things as they are? What do you say when you see things?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.<br/>
<br/>
        George If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and 
        I<br/>
        have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square 
        Garden. <br/>
        Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner 
        at<br/>
        seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right<br/>
        babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. 
        I<br/>
        can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye.  'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer I know.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry and George He knows?<br/>
<br/>
        George Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Maybe it's a shortcut.<br/>
<br/>
        George We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry  'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this 
        exit?<br/>
<br/>
        Chauffer Pick up the other members of your party.<br/>
<br/>
        George Right. The other members of our party.  Other<br/>
        members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know 
        we<br/>
        were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this 
        jig.<br/>
<br/>
        George It was a good jig.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do 
        now? <br/>
        They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        George There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a 
        limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well you should have been O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        George Yes, you have to be Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George You're Murphy!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I'm Seinfeld!<br/>
<br/>
        George You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry We're doing sixty miles an hour!<br/>
<br/>
        George So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Who are you, Mannix?<br/>
<br/>
        George We're slowing down. Are those the people?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
        The limo pulls over, two people, a man  and a woman , get in.<br/>
<br/>
        Woman  Mr. O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva  Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather<br/>
        excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his<br/>
        newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Newsletter?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim And of course, his great book, ""The Game"".<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've 
        never<br/>
        uh, met him before?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva No.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Never seen a picture of him?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Never.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Not even on the book jacket?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva There was no picture on the book jacket.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry  Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake 
        up.<br/>

<br/>
        Kramer Hey!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Hey!<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer What, you took a cab?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Yeah? So?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer How much do you make?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I'm not telling you.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer C'mon.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine No!<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer I'll tell you how much I make.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, 
        I<br/>
        don't even like basketball.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer You ever seen Michael Jordan?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Just in those commercials.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What's that?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Huh?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of 
        garbage<br/>
        cans.<br/>
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry  I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You think someone's been tipped off?<br/>
<br/>
        George So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva  Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.<br/>
<br/>
        George Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman<br/>
        thinks of ""The Big Game"".<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The 
        way you<br/>
        analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left 
        me<br/>
        breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the<br/>
        epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.<br/>
<br/>
        George Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry He tends to exaggerate.<br/>
<br/>
        George Okay, I mean it's serious but--<br/>
<br/>
        Eva We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.<br/>
<br/>
        George Uh, my speech?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it 
        over?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Well you might as well look it over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer So what's going on, how did all this happen?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're 
        all going<br/>
        to the Knicks-Bulls game.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine He did.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call 
        them<br/>
        O'Brien and Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.<br/>
<br/>
        George ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied<br/>
        government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white<br/>
        minority communities.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry You're not going to open with that, are you?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?<br/>
<br/>
        George I said so many things.<br/>
<br/>
        Suddenly they hear a loud bang.<br/>
<br/>
        George They're shooting! They're shooting!<br/>
<br/>
        Tim  Alright, get down!<br/>
<br/>
        The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, 
        Eva has<br/>
        fallen on top of George.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.<br/>
<br/>
        George That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim returns.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, 
        we're<br/>
        prepared to handle anything that might come up.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling<br/>
        it sensually.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Nice looking Lugar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        New scene.<br/>
        Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square 
        Garden<br/>
        where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering 
        to<br/>
        protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader 
        of the<br/>
        midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their 
        most<br/>
        charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the 
        violent<br/>
        overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration 
        of Adolf<br/>
        Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There 
        is a<br/>
        full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell 
        me he is<br/>
        in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, 
        but<br/>
        quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional<br/>
        fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm 
        Jodi<br/>
        Baskerville, back to you in the studio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up 
        Jerry. <br/>
        They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and 
        wanna be<br/>
        called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?<br/>
<br/>
        A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized<br/>
        Elaine.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Elaine?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Good.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, Kramer?<br/>
<br/>
        They shake hands.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head 
        of<br/>
        the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first 
        time<br/>
        he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Who?<br/>
<br/>
        Dan The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo.<br/>
        Jerry and George are alone inside.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry What's taking him so long out there?<br/>
<br/>
        George Didja see the way she was looking at me?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!<br/>
<br/>
        George I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna 
        do?<br/>
<br/>
        George I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Let's just make a run for it.<br/>
<br/>
        George I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry How'd that happen?<br/>
<br/>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
        George I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers 
        in real<br/>
        tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick 
        it out<br/>
        and I pulled it.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with 
        your<br/>
        feet like that.<br/>
<br/>
        George For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the 
        police.<br/>
<br/>
        George grabs the phone and dials.<br/>
<br/>
        George 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah<br/>
        listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--<br/>
<br/>
        Tim re-enters the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        George --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! 
        The<br/>
        Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim We'll be ready in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
        George Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the 
        middle<br/>
        of something.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.<br/>
<br/>
        George Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You are.<br/>
<br/>
        George And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular<br/>
        again?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You are.<br/>
<br/>
        George Good. I think you forgot something.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
        George Good. Now get out.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim leaves.<br/>
<br/>
        George Okay, what are we gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
        George Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, 
        we see<br/>
        Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I'm sure he was just joking around.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,<br/>
        Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. 
        Yes!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What is it?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about 
        Jerry,<br/>
        always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The 
        limo? <br/>
        The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same<br/>
        person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Jerry's a nazi?!<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer I can't believe I didn't see it.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer You don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine No, he's just neat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        George Me??<br/>
<br/>
        George and Jerry laugh nervously.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim And you really don't look like a Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
        George He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Where are you from?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. 
        <br/>
        Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country<br/>
        though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Sounds more like Scottish.<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry We were right on the border.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the street corner.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Maybe he's with the company.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization<br/>
        from within.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What about his comedy act?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, 
        he's<br/>
        too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine What about George?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. 
        <br/>
        No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're 
        with<br/>
        the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and 
        Hunt<br/>
        and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who 
        killed<br/>
        Kennedy!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine I'll bet they were even in on it.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. 
         I'm not gonna.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Kramer, you're hurting me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Quick cut to the now approaching limo.<br/>
<br/>
        George Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk 
        to<br/>
        them, pull over.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Get off of me!!<br/>
<br/>
        The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
        This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby 
        bus<br/>
        stop.<br/>
<br/>
        Man O'Brien? Is that him?<br/>
<br/>
        Man #2 Yeah, that's him.<br/>
<br/>
        Man #3 Look there's O'Brien!<br/>
<br/>
        Man #4 Filthy nazi bastard!<br/>
<br/>
        All four Let's get him!!<br/>
<br/>
        They begin running full speed towards the gang.<br/>
<br/>
        George What do I do?! What do I do?!<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Get in the car! Get in the car!<br/>
<br/>
        George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer  O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        Tim Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
        Jerry No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine It could be very confusing.<br/>
<br/>
        The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Yeah? Eva?<br/>
<br/>
        Eva It's for me.  Hello?  It's O'Brien.<br/>
<br/>
<!-- BeginAd04 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Kramer O'Brien? Well that's weird.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva  Who are you?<br/>
<br/>
        George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car 
        broke<br/>
        down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group 
        of<br/>
        protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of 
        the three<br/>
        are intelligible at this point.<br/>
<br/>
        Jodi They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police 
        seem<br/>
        unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien 
        must be<br/>
        having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first 
        public<br/>
        appearance.<br/>
<br/>
        Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less<br/>
        understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming<br/>
        unnerved.<br/>
<br/>
        Eva Get out!!<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!<br/>
<br/>
        Dan Elaine?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD<br/>
        O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.<br/>
<br/>
        George I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! 
        <br/>
        Jerry?! Jerry?!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Closing monologue.<br/>
<br/>
        So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie 
        and<br/>
        there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies 
        always<br/>
        had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they 
        would do<br/>
        and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil,<br/>
        remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how 
        are ya,<br/>
        is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the 
        copier? <br/>
        Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, 
        nice<br/>
        to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?<br/>
<br/>
        End. "
"kramer"," You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? 
               Ill do it!"
"kramer"," Well, why dont you take your clothes off?"
"kramer","  Well, itd be our little secret."
"george","  Button 
              fly!"
"jerry"," I like the button fly."
"george","  What?"
"jerry"," That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking"
"george"," Nothing."
"jerry"," I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check 
              out her"
"george"," I dont get art."
"jerry"," Theres nothing to get."
"george"," Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have 
              to have"
"jerry"," She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting 
              Kramer"
"george"," What for?"
"jerry"," She sees something in him."
"george"," So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall."
"kramer"," Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown.  
              Or, really,"
"kramer"," She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary 
              Todd."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, they're like this ."
"kramer"," Why, what's the difference?"
"kramer"," Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships."
"george"," You know, I'm a little nervous."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel 
              like I'm"
"jerry"," I don't know how long this is gonna last."
"george"," Really? I thought you liked her."
"jerry"," I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like 
              me having"
"george"," You know, it's a miracle you're not married.  Hey, 
              I'm not"
"jerry"," Hi, Nina.  This is my friend George."
"jerry","  Hey, look at this 
              guy!"
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"jerry","  I brought George up to see some of your paintings."
"george","  Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested."
"kramer"," George, you gonna buy a painting?"
"george","  Yeah, sure."
"george"," I am an art-adorer! I adore art."
"jerry"," May I? "
"jerry"," What's this?"
"jerry","  Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm 
              going"
"kramer","  Yeah."
"jerry"," They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!"
"george"," Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?"
"george"," All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the 
              dugout!"
"george"," Look at where we are!  He's 
              not"
"george"," She said first row! Right behind the dugout!"
"elaine"," Well, it's the second row. It's just as good."
"george"," I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my 
              feet up"
"elaine"," Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better 
              than"
"george"," Oh, there's better,  
              right"
"kramer"," Right.  Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? 
              (Kramer"
"elaine"," I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now."
"george","  You're supposed to do that?"
"elaine","  Yeah.  What makes you think anyone would 
              want to"
"george"," I'd rather go to a hanging."
"elaine"," Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit 
              my father"
"kramer","  YOU BETTER CATCH 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              IT,"
"george"," Yeah?"
"george"," Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--"
"elaine"," Hi!"
"kramer","  HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, 
              BABE!"
"george"," --and this is Kramer."
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"george"," Okay."
"elaine"," Great, great."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"george"," Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what 
              it costs."
"elaine","  Yeah. I better!"
"elaine"," You're not serious."
"elaine"," Well, did he say that?"
"elaine"," Well maybe you should ask him!"
"elaine"," No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? 
              This"
"george"," Just take the cap off."
"elaine"," George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!"
"elaine"," Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off."
"george"," Just take the cap off!"
"elaine"," No!"
"kramer"," Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!"
"george","  Do you want us to go with you?"
"kramer","  I'll go get your hat, George."
"elaine","  Stay!"
"george"," Okay, we'll go!"
"elaine"," ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls 
              right over"
"jerry"," Is he okay?"
"elaine"," Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, 
              and you"
"jerry"," This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did 
              he want you"
"elaine"," I know! Can you imagine that?"
"jerry"," How you feeling?"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.  
              Hey,"
"elaine"," Wha- a picture?"
"kramer"," A picture."
"elaine"," OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??"
"kramer"," Uh-huh."
"elaine","  I cannot believe this!"
"jerry","  There's George!"
"kramer"," Yup, yup!"
"elaine"," Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting 
              my father!"
"elaine"," Hi, Mr. Lippman."
"elaine"," My, my father?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," I went to visit him."
"elaine"," Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia..."
"elaine"," Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit 
              must have"
"elaine"," What--what did I say?"
"elaine"," I did?"
"elaine"," Oh! Where are you going?"
"elaine"," Ah. ...Yeah."
"elaine"," There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You 
              know, the"
"elaine"," Wha-- oh!  Oh, god!  That is 
              the THIRD"
"elaine"," Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! 
              "
"jerry"," It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball 
              cap"
"jerry"," Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe 
              we"
"jerry"," Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends 
              with!"
"george"," Five-hundred dollars?! What?"
"jerry"," That's what she told me!"
"george"," I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!"
"jerry"," That's what it costs!"
"george"," Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!"
"jerry"," I wasn't thinking! I don't know."
"george"," You weren't thinking."
"jerry"," Well, she framed it and everything."
"george"," Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm 
              buying this!"
"jerry"," Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint 
              you some-"
"george"," I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, 
              it'd be a"
"kramer","  This was in 
              front of your"
"george"," Hey, Kramer."
"kramer"," Hi, Mike."
"jerry","  Wow, a letter from Nina!"
"kramer","  Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing 
              I've ever"
"jerry","  Oh my god!"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," This is amazing, you can't believe this!"
"george"," What's it say?"
"jerry"," Listen to this ""I don't know what you expect to find 
              out there,"
"george"," WOW!"
"kramer","  She's deep."
"jerry","  ""...'cause that's what you need to do 
              to prove I'm not"
"kramer"," You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!"
"jerry"," No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was 
              wrong about"
"kramer","  Yeah! Get in there and 
              give her a"
"jerry"," Should I?"
"kramer","  YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD!  
              Fight"
"jerry"," ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her."
"jerry"," SHOT!  I told ya! 
              (the inter-"
"george","  It's George."
"jerry"," Come on up.  Well, now we gotta get a posse together. 
              I love"
"jerry"," The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. 
              Get away"
"george"," Hey, Nina!  I owe you some money, don't I?"
"george"," Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, 
              in fact, "
"george"," This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with 
              me! It should"
"george"," Who said anything about money? "
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"elaine","  It's Elaine."
"jerry"," Come on up."
"jerry"," ...Yeah."
"jerry"," She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. 
              (pointing"
"george"," I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," How 'bout Kramer."
"jerry"," HUGE pop-in guy!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Okay!"
"elaine","  Hello!"
"elaine","  Chatty gal.  Lippman's coming back tomorrow, 
              I'll"
"jerry"," If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!"
"elaine"," No, he wants to torture me. "
"elaine","  Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when 
              you're the"
"jerry","  I'm a great clicker! "
"elaine"," You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! 
              I've never"
"jerry"," Let go!"
"elaine"," No, come on! I want it, Jerry!"
"jerry"," Let go, Elaine!"
"elaine"," Well at least let George do it!"
"jerry"," Oh, George can't click! "
"george","  Give it! Give it! 
              (he finally"
"jerry"," Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch 
              it a little"
"elaine"," It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon."
"jerry","  Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches 
              the TV"
"elaine"," What letter?"
"jerry"," This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from 
              the movie!"
"jerry"," ""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort 
              to offer happiness"
"george"," This is incredible!"
"jerry"," I always thought there was something funny about this letter! 
              She cop-"
"george"," Maybe I won't send her that check."
"elaine"," You know, it's not really that terrible. "
"jerry"," What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented 
              herself!"
"elaine"," Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore."
"elaine"," Well, uh, fan. My father--"
"elaine"," Really?"
"elaine"," So... impudent."
"elaine","  Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--"
"elaine","  Okay."
"elaine"," That will be fun."
"jerry"," How's it coming?"
"jerry"," Seen any good movies lately?"
"jerry"," No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You 
              like Neil"
"jerry"," I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to 
              be, uh..."
"jerry"," I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other 
              night."
"george"," Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? 
              "
"jerry"," Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!"
"george"," So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?"
"jerry"," Yeah.  And by the 
              way, can"
"george"," Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it 
              to you right"
"george"," Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other 
              day."
"kramer"," ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and 
              hopped a "
"kramer"," Yeah, sure. Please."
"kramer"," Yeah.  And, it was a big one."
"jerry"," Kramer, what are you doing here!?"
"kramer"," Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to 
        wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" 
        and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare 
        keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper."
"jerry"," You scared me!"
"kramer"," It's just me."
"jerry"," That's enough!"
"kramer"," Forgot the popper... &lt;goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, 
        drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.&gt;"
"jerry"," Kramer! What are you doing?!"
"kramer"," What does it look like I'm doing? What?"
"jerry"," Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!"
"kramer"," Alright, alright..."
"jerry"," C'mon!"
"kramer"," Sorry. "
"jerry"," Move it! Move it! Get going!"
"kramer"," My drain's all clogged up! &lt;Comes out of the bathroom in a 
        towel, covered in soap suds.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, 
        and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your 
        apartment?"
"jerry"," Oh. I see. There he is! &lt;Pretends the murderers are coming.&gt; 
      "
"jerry"," The murderers! &lt;Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.&gt;"
"jerry"," Did you see the look on that guy's face?"
"jerry"," Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!"
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies."
"jerry"," All right, that's it. Hand 'em over. "
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your 
        key privileges. "
"kramer"," Oh, come on!"
"jerry"," No, come on!"
"kramer"," What, what, I thought you went to the movies!"
"jerry"," It was sold out!"
"kramer"," Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?"
"jerry"," <i>That's</i> the point."
"kramer"," What point?"
"jerry"," Just, look, just give the keys."
"kramer"," Just give me another chance!"
"jerry"," Don't ask me!"
"kramer"," I'm asking you!"
"jerry"," I'm telling you."
"kramer"," You're joking."
"jerry"," I'm serious!"
"kramer"," It's not going to happen again!"
"jerry"," Yes it will, now give me those keys!"
"jerry"," So put 'em in a safe place."
"elaine"," I will. "
"jerry"," Where?"
"elaine"," I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?"
"jerry"," I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different."
"elaine"," Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back."
"jerry"," I can't."
"jerry"," Who's there?"
"elaine"," Oh, I'm not, uh..."
"kramer"," No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. 
        I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of 
        the keys."""
"elaine"," Jerry, give him the keys back."
"jerry"," Elaine..."
"kramer"," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned 
        out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of 
        a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. 
        To float.  And I thank you."
"jerry"," Take the keys."
"kramer"," I don't want the keys! &lt;Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, 
        but Kramer refuses.&gt; "
"jerry"," O.K.!"
"kramer"," Now, one more thing - I would like <i>my</i> keys back."
"jerry"," Your spare set?"
"kramer"," That's right."
"jerry"," You want 'em back?"
"kramer"," Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best."
"george"," Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say."
"kramer"," Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!"
"george"," Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? 
        Because Elaine has my keys. "
"kramer"," Well, you can get 'em back."
"george"," I suppose I could."
"kramer"," Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? 
        That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, 
        it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And 
        cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor 
        in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. 
        I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the 
        darkness...like you."
"george"," Me?"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George."
"george"," Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. &lt;The waitress 
        comes over.&gt;"
"george"," Yearn? Do I yearn?"
"kramer"," I yearn. "
"george"," You yearn. "
"kramer"," Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you 
        yearned?"
"george"," Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant 
        craving...but I haven't yearned."
"george"," Aw, Kramer, don't start..."
"george"," I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my 
        life!"
"kramer"," O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," You got money?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," Do you have a woman?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," Do you have any prospects?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," You got anything on the horizon?"
"george"," Uh...no."
"kramer"," Do you have any action at all?"
"george"," No."
"kramer"," Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the 
        morning?"
"george"," I like to get the Daily News!"
"kramer"," George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little 
        boys."
"george"," Why?"
"kramer"," I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug."
"george"," Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too."
"kramer"," No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie."
"george"," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one 
        line! You got fired!"
"kramer"," I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you 
        coming with me?"
"george"," Uh, no, I'm not."
"kramer"," Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're 
        key brothers now. &lt;Gets up to leave.&gt;"
"george"," You're not really gonna go to California, are you?"
"george"," Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my 
        keys, so I need mine back from you."
"elaine"," Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?"
"george"," I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother."" 
      "
"elaine"," That's ridiculous."
"elaine"," I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back."
"george"," What for?"
"elaine"," 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry."
"george"," Jerry? Why?"
"elaine"," 'Cause he gave me his."
"george"," So what?"
"elaine"," So, if he has my keys, I should have his. "
"george"," Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours."
"elaine"," I just said the same thing to you."
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have 
        them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?"
"elaine"," Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. &lt;George begins to leaf through 
        papers on Elaine's counter.&gt; What are you doing? Would you just put 
        that down? &lt;Takes the papers away from George.&gt; I gotta get some 
        new friends."
"jerry"," Did you bring the keys? "
"george"," Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's 
        apartment without his permission."
"jerry"," This could be an emergency!"
"george"," You never should have taken away his keys!"
"jerry"," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. &lt;Jerry and 
        George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.&gt;"
"george"," How'd the Mets do?"
"jerry"," They lost."
"jerry"," Kramer? "
"jerry"," Hello, Newman."
"newman"," You lookin' for someone?"
"jerry"," Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!"
"newman"," Coy? I'm not being coy."
"george"," Yeah, coy."
"jerry"," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?"
"jerry"," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!"
"newman"," Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses."
"jerry"," Turn around, George."
"george"," Sure. &lt;Turns around.&gt;"
"newman"," George?"
"jerry"," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have 
        to do this the hard way? &lt;Hits wall with his fist.&gt;"
"newman"," Help! Help!"
"jerry"," Where's Kramer?"
"newman"," HELP! &lt;Elaine enters.&gt;"
"elaine"," What's going on?"
"newman"," They're gonna beat me up!"
"george"," No we're not."
"jerry"," We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer."
"newman"," You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened 
        to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about 
        the keys. Thought he got a bad rap."
"jerry"," Bad rap?"
"newman"," Yeah. From you."
"jerry"," Me?"
"newman"," You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La 
        Land. L.A."
"jerry"," L.A.?"
"jerry"," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! 
        I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? 
        I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't 
        you see it?"
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, I saw it. &lt;mutters under her breath&gt; I mean, 
        it's complete bullsh*t."
"jerry"," Huh? "
"elaine"," What...?"
"jerry"," No, what'd you say?"
"elaine"," Nothing. I didn't say anything."
"jerry"," Oh, you didn't see it."
"elaine"," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep."
"jerry"," I heard you say something, there."
"elaine"," I didn't say anything."
"jerry"," I'm calling Kramer's mother. &lt;Picks up the phone, dials.&gt; 
         I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard 
        something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the 
        music down? Could you turn the music down!"
"george"," Ask her about Kramer."
"jerry"," She's drunk out of her mind."
"george"," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't 
        feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment."
"jerry"," Don't feel right? What are you talking about? "
"george"," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you 
        want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can 
        I just let you in?"
"jerry"," What is the big deal?"
"george"," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle 
        you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's 
        keys."
"jerry"," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. 
        You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, 
        because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys."
"george"," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, 
        he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which 
        case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her."
"jerry"," Well, I want those keys. &lt;Tries to grab the keys from George.&gt;"
"george"," Nope, no can do."
"jerry"," George, give them to me, I want these keys. &lt;They struggle 
        over the keys.&gt; I don't want to get physical!"
"george"," Do you wanna fight?"
"jerry"," Do you wanna fight?"
"george"," I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! &lt;The struggle continues.&gt;"
"kramer"," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome 
        young prince."
"kramer"," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the 
        cruel, cruel world."
"kramer"," Oh, he's cold."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny.  Hey, you can drop me 
        here!"
"kramer"," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now."
"kramer"," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' 
        in Ivory liquid? &lt;mimics choking somebody&gt;"
"jerry"," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna 
        give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's 
        happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to 
        me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give 
        her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has 
        mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could 
        get mine."
"george"," You're right, how did I miss that? &lt;Begins unlocking the door, 
        mutters under his breath&gt; Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t."
"jerry"," What's that?"
"george"," Nothing."
"jerry"," I heard something."
"george"," Didn't say anything. "
"kramer"," So, how long you been drivin' this thing?"
"kramer"," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi."
"kramer"," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch 
        those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. "
"kramer"," Really?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"george"," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!"
"jerry"," Well, this is great. "
"george"," Well, what do they look like?"
"jerry"," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys.  ""What do they look like."""
"george"," Well, they're obviously not here."
"jerry"," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere."
"george"," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall 
        opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," By Elaine Benes?"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?"
"george"," Lemme see this. "
"jerry"," Wait a second! "
"george"," Gimme half!"
"jerry"," All right, here! "
"george"," Why didn't she tell us?"
"elaine"," You weasels!"
"jerry"," What? What?"
"elaine"," How dare you!"
"george"," We hardly read anything!"
"jerry"," It was funny!"
"elaine"," Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through 
        all my things? You thought it was funny?"
"jerry"," Well... &lt;picks up some of the pages&gt; From what I saw..."
"jerry"," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys."
"george"," He forced me to!"
"jerry"," I did not!"
"george"," Yes you did!"
"elaine"," You! Get out! Get out! Get out!"
"jerry"," Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!"
"elaine"," Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!"
"jerry"," Good!"
"george"," What, you don't want me to hold your keys?"
"elaine"," No, you can't be trusted!"
"george"," Alright, alright, fine. &lt;Gives the keys to Elaine.&gt;"
"elaine"," Good! I won't!"
"jerry"," Good! Don't! Are these my keys?"
"elaine"," These aren't my keys!"
"george"," Whose are these?"
"elaine"," I don't know!"
"elaine"," I just thought I could write it."
"jerry"," Is that something you want to do?"
"elaine"," I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money."
"jerry"," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard 
        work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch 
        the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to 
        each other."
"elaine"," O.K., can I just watch the show? &lt;mutters under her breath&gt; 
        God, what an asshole."
"jerry"," What did you say?"
"elaine"," I didn't say anything."
"jerry"," I heard something. &lt;Looks at the TV&gt; Elaine, Elaine! It's 
        Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
"jerry"," Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!"
"kramer"," Oh, good morning, Miss Brown."
"kramer"," Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell."
"kramer"," Steven."
"kramer"," Oh - I'm familiar with it."
"jerry"," Well this is it."
"jerry"," Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that 
              garlic. "
"jerry"," No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things 
              were garlic."
"jerry"," No, I mean, I don't think so."
"jerry"," No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. 
              If anything"
"jerry"," That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. 
              Why don't you"
"george","  Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set 
              foe the week end. "
"jerry"," This thing has never worked right. "
"jerry"," Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved 
              internationally known cartoon characters of "
"jerry"," How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.?"
"george"," Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?"
"jerry"," Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!"
"george"," Well, I didn't think anyone would play it."
"jerry"," Well, now she's not going away for this weekend."
"george"," What do you mean not goin'? We got plans here. Call her 
              up."
"jerry"," Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going 
              to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a "
"george"," Well maybe you should ask Elaine. "
"jerry"," Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted. "
"george"," Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand 
              him. He vomited all over her. "
"jerry"," Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke? "
"jerry"," Ah, Kramer."
"kramer"," Hello boys, top of the morning to ya. What do you say? 
              What do ya be?"
"jerry"," Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. 
              You had to give him a box of cigars. "
"kramer"," So, what are you guys doin this weekend?"
"jerry",", GEORGE uh uh, we're uh .."
"kramer"," Because I'm going to e playing golf at the Westchester 
              country club. Hum."
"jerry"," Westchester? Isn't that a private club?"
"kramer"," Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. 
              But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. "
"jerry"," and GEORGE ye, hu, um ye, "

"jerry"," and GEORGE No, no, no, no."
"george"," That's pie country."
"jerry"," Yeah"

"jerry"," They sell them by the side of the road."
"elaine"," I don't know. "
"jerry"," Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. 
              If you're there it will be a better group."
"elaine"," What's that? "
"jerry"," Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I don't 
              know what to write on these things."
"elaine"," ""I'm very imPRESSED""? ... Ah you mean pressed

"jerry"," Oh, I thought it was like an igloo."
"jerry"," Ah ha."
"elaine"," Who has the remote?"
"elaine"," The remote goes through the bubble? "
"jerry"," So you have no control over the remote? "
"elaine"," Yeah, of course, yeah."
"jerry"," That's nice! "

"elaine"," Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to."

"susan"," What's a bubble boy?"
"jerry"," He lives in a bubble. "
"george"," Boy!"
"susan"," So, what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?"
"jerry"," No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big 
              piece of plastic dividing the room. "
"susan"," Oh, "
"george"," What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think 
              like that dry cleaning plastic?"
"jerry"," That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway 
              what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow."
"susan"," Well, where does he live? "

"george"," Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that? "
"susan"," Why?"
"george"," ... just sit in your seat over there you're distracting 
              me. We're making incredible time here. "
"jerry"," What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? 
              I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he? "
"elaine"," Isn't that blue car him? "
"jerry"," No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe 
              it. I lost him. That stupid idiot."
"elaine"," It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble 
              boy's house. "
"jerry"," I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even 
              remember the name of the town. "
"elaine"," Wa',you don't have the directions? "
"jerry"," No, I was following him."

"elaine"," Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for 
              you in his bubble, or igloo thing or whatever."
"jerry"," I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM "
"elaine"," Just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out. 
            "
"susan"," We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM! "
"george"," It's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it 
              to follow somebody? "
"susan"," Well now what are you going to do? "
"george"," It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house. 
            "
"susan"," Does he have the address? "
"jerry","  Leave a message. I'll call you back. 
              Thanks."
"kramer"," Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. 
              Yeah, I'm the next door neighbour. Aw, well you know, "
"kramer"," So then I drive all the way up to the country club and 
              then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind"
"kramer"," These are Cubans. &lt;IN FAKE SPANISH&gt; Maria, poquendo 
              los scientos de estes con gleam."
"george"," I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's 
              car anywhere. "
"george"," Stop, would you quit it."
"george"," Maybe someone is going to see us here."
"susan"," So what? You are SUCH a prude."
"george"," Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best 
              of them. "
"susan"," Come on lets go in. "
"george"," What?"
"susan"," Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might 
              be very late if they make it at all. "
"george"," I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy. "
"susan"," What's the matter?"
"susan"," We're goin' in. Come on. "
"george"," Susan, please... &lt;grabs her&gt;"
"susan"," George. Stop."
"george"," Would you wai,.."
"jerry"," &lt;ranting&gt; Can't believe how a little thing like George 
              going too fast - how my whole weekend is gone - the plans,"
"elaine"," Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy? "
"jerry"," Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have 
              to mention the BB? You don't have to mention the BB."
"jerry"," I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club. "
"elaine"," I'll just have a glass of water. "
"jerry","  You can't just have water. "
"elaine"," Why not? That's all I want."
"jerry"," Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in 
              and sit down. It's a business. "
"jerry"," Oh, no."
"elaine"," YES! yes. You saw him on TV. "
"elaine"," Jerry Seinfeld."
"jerry"," Elaaaiinne..."

"elaine"," Waddya' write?"
"jerry"," No good?"
"elaine"," THIS is what you came up with? "
"jerry"," Well."
"elaine"," That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading 
              that for the next twenty years and laughing at you."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. would you 
              mind. I'd like to take the picture back. I'm not happy with what 
              I wrote."
"jerry"," No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with 
              something really funny written on it."
"jerry"," No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture. "
"george"," Hi."
"susan"," Hello."
"george"," 'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend 
              Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... you know ...bubble. I got a lot of 
              bubble experience. Come on."
"susan"," I, I have no story. "
"george"," She works for NBC. "
"george"," Well, you know we gotta been running because of the ..."
"george"," Humph, no, uh, it's just that ..."
"jerry"," Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't 
              like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give 
              it back to me. "
"jerry"," I want that picture. "
"jerry"," I'm not paying for anything until I get that back."
"jerry"," Well, maybe I'll just take it back. &lt;Hits picture&gt;"
"elaine"," This chicken is really good."
"george"," All right BB. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 
              8th century?"
"george"," Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer 
              is, The MOOPS. "
"george"," I'm sorry the card says MOOPS. "
"george"," It's MOOPS. "
"george"," MOOPS, "
"kramer"," Hey, anybody home?"
"kramer"," Huh, hold these &lt;boxes of&gt; pies. "
"george"," Help, someone. &lt;BUBBLE BOY is strangling George&gt;"
"susan"," Stop it. Let go of him!"
"jerry"," What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine! "
"jerry"," No, I want the picture back."
"jerry"," The BB? He lives around here? "
"kramer"," Naomi, come on let's get goin'. "
"kramer"," Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process. "
"kramer"," Let's go. OK, "
"george"," Jerry, what happened to you? "
"jerry"," What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles 
              an hour. "
"george"," I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was trying to kill me. Susan 
              tell him."
"susan"," It's a long story. "
"jerry"," Hey, Happy Birthday. "
"elaine"," Hi."
"george"," Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' 
              you little twerp? "
"george"," MOOPS"
"george"," Go, go, get out, ..."
"jerry"," Fire engines?"
"george"," Must be a big one."
"susan"," Do you smell something?"
"jerry"," Yeah, smoke."
"george"," yeah, &lt;cough&gt; Definite smoke."
"elaine"," Argh, look at the fire! &lt;cough&gt;"
"jerry"," Holy cow! look at that!"
"susan"," IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!"
"elaine"," The CABIN is on fire!"
"george"," I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from 
              the toll."
"elaine"," How could this have happened?"
"kramer"," &lt;singing&gt; ... wild funky mountain man ..."
"jerry"," What are you two doin' here?"
"jerry"," You didn't &lt;makes motion like lighting a cigar&gt;"
"kramer"," &lt;runs to burning cabin&gt; My Cubans!"
"jerry"," She hasn't told her father yet?"
"george"," No. We're supposed to tell him tonight."
"jerry"," ""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?"
"george"," Susan wants me to be there."
"jerry"," You're meetin' the father for the first time?"
"george","  Yeah."
"jerry","  Well, you'll make quite an impression 
              on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down."
"george"," I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!"
"jerry","  I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it 
              Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban 
              cigars.."
"george"," Yeah, I know what happened."
"jerry"," No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer.."
"george","  I know."
"jerry","  ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin 
              down with one of those very same cigars!  
              It's very comical.."
"george"," Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a 
              lot on my mind."
"jerry","  No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's 
              the day."
"george","  I wonder how 
              Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the 
              worst he could do? So you burn"
"jerry","  C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a 
              cabin."
"george"," We could build a cabin like  that."
"jerry","  Well, maybe not us, but two men could."
"george","  Bics? 
              What, d'ja get, bics?"
"jerry"," What, you got a problem with the pen now?"
"george"," Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth."
"jerry"," Alright, let's just get to work.  
              NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I,"
"george","  So, you're gonna sit there?"
"jerry","  Just - just park yourself.  Alright. Act I, Scene A."
"george","  Drink?"
"jerry"," No, no thank you."
"george","  Alright, here we go."
"jerry"," Act I, Scene A.. "
"george"," Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?"
"jerry","  Yes.  Hi, is Elaine 
              there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,"
"elaine"," Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil 
              thing happenin' here..  Uh, I gotta go. 
              I gotta go. "
"jerry"," Okay, let's go. "
"george"," Alright, here we go. You got it?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Here we go."
"jerry"," Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in."
"george","  It's beautiful. 
              Now, what do I say?"
"elaine"," Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could 
              you not talk to them for too long?"
"elaine"," No, no."
"elaine"," Oh, no, he didn't say anything."
"elaine","  No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
              I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right 
              now. It's very hard being a"
"george"," Alright, let's go."
"jerry"," Here we go."
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something 
              here. We're trying to do a little work.."
"jerry"," Yeah, come on.  What's 
              with you?"
"kramer","  No more golf."
"jerry"," Why?"
"kramer"," Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, 
              at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every 
              time I give him a couple"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer","  Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!  Hey, George, maybe you can 
              ask Susan's father for"
"george"," What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars 
              after you burned down his cabin!"
"kramer"," Why? What's one thing got to do with another?"
"george"," Kramer, please."
"kramer"," Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! 
              I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass 
              has big brown patches in it,"
"george"," Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them 
              some place else."
"kramer","  Where? They're Cubans. "
"george","  You know what? Maybe I should take off."
"jerry"," What?!"
"george"," Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house 
              for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want 
              to leave myself plenty of time."
"jerry","  You got four hours! What about the 
              script?"
"george"," I think we got a bite on it. "
"george"," Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with 
              feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling 
              in virtual anonymity. I mean.."
"george"," Oh, uh, the cigars..  I'm, uh, suckin' 
              'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah."
"george","  I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. 
              "
"susan","  He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy."
"susan","  Daddy never laughs."
"george"," Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what 
              is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? 
              What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?"
"susan"," Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk 
              to you about.."
"george","  Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. 
              well, "
"jerry"," Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her 
              that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm 
              responsible for this"
"elaine","  I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. 
              Would you call her?"
"jerry","  Ohh.. dial the number.  How could you do this?"
"elaine","  I was just trying to help 
              you."
"jerry","  Oh, just trying to  help me..  Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry 
              Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her"
"george"," The cabin..  Well..  Susan?"
"susan"," Uhh.. about the cabin.."
"george","  Kinda like Superman's fortress 
              of solitude."
"george"," S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude 
              up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it 
              all.."
"susan"," Daddy.."
"susan"," Daddy, about the cabin.."
"susan"," Well, the thing is.."
"susan"," Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?"
"george","  Burned."
"susan"," There was a fire, and it uh.. "
"george"," Burned."
"george","  yeah, burned. Whoo.."
"susan","  No. Nothing."
"george"," Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole 
              situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's 
              really rather ironic - one might even"
"jerry"," What?!"
"jerry"," What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was 
              just trying to keep up!"
"jerry"," Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join 
              in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed."
"jerry","  I'm not sick.  
              You - you said much sicker things than me."
"jerry"," I really think you're making too much of this."
"jerry"," Let me walk you to a cab."
"jerry"," I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, 
              and that'll be the end of it."
"jerry","  I mean, people - they're not interested 
              in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really 
              don't."
"jerry"," So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she 
              starts rubbing my leg."
"george"," Wo-hoah! What did you do?"
"jerry","  Have you ever told a woman to stop touching 
              your leg?"
"george"," Yeah, right."
"jerry"," I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in 
              Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off 
              my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the"
"george"," Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do 
              they do that?"
"jerry"," I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.."
"george"," Alright, so, go ahead."
"jerry"," So we go back to my apartment.."
"george","  Woah. Whoa! Woah!"
"jerry"," So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting 
              a little passionate..  and, uh, she starts"
"george","  Alright, alright, hold on!  Time out! Woah, woah!  What did she say?"
"jerry","  Oh, you know, the usual.."
"george"," No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?"
"jerry"," Typical things."
"george","  What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme 
              some typical."
"jerry"," She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so 
              shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup 
              bottle - ketchup squirts out"
"george","  That's very dirty.  That's 
              absolutely filthy."
"jerry"," ..And then she starts talking about her panties."
"george","  Gonna need some water here!"
"jerry"," So I said something."
"george"," Ok, what did you say?"
"jerry","  Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep 
              up."
"george"," Of course."
"jerry"," Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I 
              said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"""
"george","  ""The panties your mother laid 
              out for you""?  What"
"jerry","  I don't know! It just popped out."
"george"," Well, how did she react?"
"jerry"," She flipped out! Just left."
"george"," Well, that's not offensive.  It's abnormal, but 
              it's not offensive."
"jerry"," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about 
              any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. 
              And she's never let me"
"jerry"," She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her 
              into it - how stupid was that? "
"george"," Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing."
"jerry"," I guess he failed to see the humor in it."
"george"," Huh.  C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today."
"jerry","  Alright, big work day."
"george"," That's right."
"george"," Okay."
"jerry"," Let's go."
"george"," Here we are."
"jerry"," Right now."
"george"," Let's do it."
"jerry"," You and me."
"george"," Okay."
"jerry"," Alright."
"george"," What'dya got?"
"jerry","  I got You enter, you go ""Hi"", 
              and I go, ""Hello."" Now.. we need something here.."
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"george"," Don't be silly."
"jerry"," Come in, we're taking a break."
"kramer","  Oh, yeah?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"kramer"," Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some 
              more cigars?"
"george","  No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that."
"kramer","  Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have 
              to take matters into my own hands, huh?  Alright, I'll see 
              you guys. (Leaves, despite"
"kramer"," Buenos dias."
"kramer"," Uh, habla ingles?"
"kramer"," Giddy-up. Ok, uh,  Um. I need to 
              talk to someone."
"kramer"," Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely 
              urgent."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah."
"kramer"," Okay."
"jerry","  Alright, let's 
              get going. C'mon, c'mon now.  C'mon, let's 
              get it together.. (Through"
"elaine"," It's Elaine."
"jerry"," C'mon up. "
"george","  Alright, you know what we 
              should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script 
              for a while.."
"jerry","  Yeah, we should."
"george"," Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment 
              and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?"
"george"," No, no, no, no."
"jerry"," Oh."
"elaine"," Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!"
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to 
              work."
"jerry"," Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think 
              about it - there's no two ways about it."
"elaine"," Why? What happened? Did you talk?"
"jerry"," Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! 
              We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks 
              that this isn't anybody you should"
"elaine"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yes."
"elaine"," Really? You really think I should fire her?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy 
              here working on the script, I'd do it myself."
"kramer","  Buenos dias."
"kramer"," Uh, Kramer."
"kramer","  Cigars."
"kramer","  Cigars."
"kramer"," Uh, see here, I..  
              I saved one of the cigar rings.."
"kramer","  Yeah, yeah. 
              That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes 
              of those from you, yeah?"
"kramer"," Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?"
"susan"," Hi!"
"george"," Hi, how are ya? "
"susan"," Hey, Jerry."

"susan"," Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second.  This is my brother,"
"george"," Ohh, hey there, young fella.  What's 
              your major?"
"george"," Well, you should always consider podiatry.  There's nothing wrong with the feet. "
"susan","  And this 
              is my Aunt, Sara."
"susan"," Excuse me.  Hello, Raymond."
"susan","  Oh, thank you.  Wow, I've never seen this before..

"george"," I'm writin' it. ""How's it going?"""
"jerry"," Okay.. "
"elaine"," Real good!"
"jerry"," What?!"
"elaine"," Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!"
"jerry"," What?! How?"
"elaine"," I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! 
              So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!"
"jerry"," What calls?!"
"elaine"," Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've 
              been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!"
"jerry"," Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?"
"elaine","  ""Anything else""? What do you mean 
              ""anything else""?"
"jerry"," So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about 
              anything?"
"elaine"," Yeah!"
"jerry","  Beautiful."
"elaine"," Why is that beautiful?"
"jerry"," Oh, no, not beautiful."
"elaine"," It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!"
"jerry"," Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that."
"elaine"," No, no."
"jerry","  No, I insist. I was the one who 
              encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-"
"elaine","  Okay."
"jerry","  fault.  Do you smell 
              smoke?"
"kramer"," Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. 
               This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto."
"jerry"," Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you."

"jerry"," Oh.  Isn't that, uh, your.."
"kramer","  Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're

"elaine","  Hey, what are 
              you reading?"
"george"," Oh, uh, ""The Falconer"" by John Cheever. It's 
              really excellent."
"elaine","  John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?"
"jerry"," Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing.  Alright,  look, we gotta"
"elaine","  Ok, I'll leave you two alone."

"elaine","  Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just 
              bought me some new panties  and they're - all laid"
"jerry"," We're dead."
"george"," We're not dead."
"jerry"," We are dead."
"george"," Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story."
"jerry"," All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with 
              something and we didn't do anything."
"george"," So we'll do it tomorrow."
"jerry"," Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went 
              skiing?"
"george"," About six years ago."
"jerry"," I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now."
"george"," Women like skiers."
"jerry"," So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan."
"george"," Yeah. Right."
"jerry"," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the 
              one on the right. She's in the closet business."
"george"," The closet business? What's the closet business?"
"jerry"," What is it your business?"
"george"," I'm interested."
"jerry"," She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize 
              your closet space. She looked into my closet."
"george"," So you thought she was good looking and figured this would 
              be a good way to meet her."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Yeah. So what happened?"
"jerry"," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. 
              What do I need more closet space for?  Hi, Marla."
"jerry"," George, Marla."
"george"," Marla."
"jerry"," Stacey."
"jerry"," George, Stacey."
"george"," Stacey."
"jerry"," George."
"george"," Jerry. Marla.  Stacey! "
"jerry"," Trip to Berlin?"
"jerry"," Oh, right, right."
"jerry"," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, 
              and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains 
              out?"""
"jerry"," Really?"
"jerry"," Oh, did he like it?"
"george"," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave 
              us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got 
              a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story 
              before we can write."
"george"," Not a bad way to make a buck."
"george"," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, 
              it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is 
              my gift. "
"jerry"," So, are you gonna go out with her?"
"george"," I might."
"jerry"," What about Susan?"
"george"," What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody 
              else?"
"jerry"," Depends."
"george"," Depends on what?"
"jerry"," On many factors."
"george"," Like what?"
"jerry"," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone 
              call frequency? Are you on a daily?"
"george"," No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week."
"jerry"," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, 
              or is a date implied?"
"george"," Implied."
"jerry"," She got anything in your medicine cabinet?"
"george"," There might be some moisturizer."
"jerry"," Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your 
              house?"
"george","  Yeah."
"jerry"," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," You got yourself a girlfriend."
"george"," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?"
"jerry"," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his 
              house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help 
              you out, but..."
"george"," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I 
              have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" 
              and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when 
              you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get 
              girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, 
              you just want more girlfriends."
"jerry"," You're going to make a good father someday."
"george"," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, 
              all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing."
"jerry"," Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?"
"george"," No, what?"
"jerry"," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over."
"george"," Why? What do you mean?"
"jerry"," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's 
              gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's 
              one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna 
              pick us up?"
"george"," Oh, right. Oh no, man."
"jerry"," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have 
              a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. 
              But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the 
              girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? 
              What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll 
              still like me and it doesn't affect the deal."
"jerry","  Oh, yeah."
"george"," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very 
              quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David 
              Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. 
              Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. 
              I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they 
              fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman."
"jerry"," This is your plan?"
"george"," No, no. I'm just thinking."
"jerry"," I don't think you are."
"jerry"," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity."
"jerry"," I don't think I am."
"jerry"," Try me."
"jerry"," Everything?"
"jerry"," You're quite mad, you know.  Oh, I don't 
              believe this.  Hey?"
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," What are you doing?"
"kramer"," I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful."
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," This is not a good time."
"kramer"," Five minutes. What?"
"jerry"," What did you have to give your TV away to George for?"
"kramer"," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. 
              I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells."
"jerry"," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. "
"kramer"," Well, wow."
"jerry"," Marla, Kramer."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Why don't you go out? It's nice out."
"kramer"," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me."
"jerry"," There's weather."
"kramer"," Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for 
              me."
"jerry"," I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back."
"kramer"," No, no, I don't want it back.  Are you gonna watch 
              the Knick game tonight?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Will you tape it?"
"jerry"," Kramer... "
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"jerry"," So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin."
"jerry"," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall."
"jerry"," Ah hah.  Excuse me one second. Yeah?"
"elaine"," It's me."
"jerry"," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. 
              I don't know what she's doing here now.  I'm sorry. What?"
"elaine"," I didn't get it."
"jerry"," Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem."
"jerry"," Snapple?"
"jerry"," Go on."
"jerry"," Yes."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hello!"
"jerry"," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted 
              to return your tape."
"jerry"," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five 
              dollars to see Havana."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting."
"elaine"," No, no, I'm leaving."
"jerry"," I like that thing in your hair there."
"elaine"," Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party 
              I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple? "
"elaine"," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened 
              to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. 
              So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, 
              it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me 
              this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, 
              big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, 
              like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. 
              You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  
              Ahh. "
"jerry"," So we'll talk about the hooks then?"
"elaine"," What? Was it something I said?"
"jerry"," She's a virgin, she just told me."
"elaine"," Well I didn't know."
"jerry"," Well it's not like spotting a toupee."
"elaine"," Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? 
              Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?"
"jerry"," No, no, I mean..."
"elaine"," 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. "
"jerry"," Elaine, Elaine...  Yeah?"
"george"," It's George."
"george"," She's a virgin?"
"jerry"," A virgin."
"george"," Wow. So what're you gonna do?"
"jerry"," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's 
              so sexy."
"george"," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember 
              the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten."
"jerry"," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have 
              any of that Lewis and Clark in you."
"george"," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.  I'm really hungry."
"jerry"," Yeah, me too."
"george"," We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting 
              on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?"
"jerry"," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me 
              just call Kramer, see if want anything.  Hey, we ordering 
              Chinese food. If you want anything--  let 
              me know what it is and I'll order for you."
"kramer"," I'm in. Let's go for it."
"george"," What do you want?"
"kramer"," I don't care, whatever."
"george"," I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes 
              and we'll just share 'em."
"kramer"," Okay. What are you getting?"
"george"," I'm gonna get a Chow Fung."
"kramer"," What's a Chow Fung?"
"george"," It's a broad noodle."
"kramer"," What do you mean, a broad noodle?"
"george"," It's a big flat noodle."
"kramer"," Well I don't want a big flat noodle."
"george"," What kind of noodle do you want?"
"kramer"," Who says I want a noodle?"
"george"," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have 
              to have any."
"kramer"," All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of 
              my pea pods."
"george"," Fine."
"kramer"," Get extra MSG."
"elaine"," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. 
              Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man 
              changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's 
              over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really 
              quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want 
              to flee the scene before the police get there."
"elaine"," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working 
              on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta 
              get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn 
              into farmers suddenly."
"elaine"," Eh."
"jerry"," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the 
              meeting. "
"george"," Where's the food? What happened to Ping?"
"jerry"," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two 
              hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get 
              through this meeting.  There's your food."
"george"," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist 
              is uninsured, you with me?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely 
              no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees 
              that he becomes my butler."
"jerry"," Your butler?"
"george"," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all 
              my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program."
"jerry"," What about me?"
"george"," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. "
"jerry","  That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. 
              Sentenced to be a butler.  Ping, what happened?"
"elaine"," There was a bit of an accident."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"elaine"," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing 
              the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the 
              way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his 
              head and everything went flying."
"george"," Something happened to the food?"
"jerry"," Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?"
"george","  The pea pods? All you saved 
              was the pea pods? "
"kramer"," Hey, you got the food?"
"jerry"," Yeah, here."
"kramer"," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!"
"kramer"," Yeah. Where's yours?"
"george"," He dropped it."
"kramer"," Oh, that's too bad."
"elaine"," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to 
              go that fast."
"kramer","  Hey, you watchin' Oprah?"
"elaine","  I did not jaywalk."
"jerry","  You're givin' him back that TV."
"kramer","  No, I don't want it back."
"george","  We got work to do. What about the meeting?"
"kramer","  Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze."
"jerry"," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe 
              we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because 
              Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, 
              and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools 
              of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. 
              I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been 
              on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? 
              It's like that  , like that! One bad impression, 
              you're outta the business!"
"george"," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here."
"jerry"," What do you mean? They know we're here."
"george"," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I 
              can't believe, my back."
"jerry"," No, no, would you get up?"
"george"," I can do this, Jerry."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," All right, I'll tell them my sister died.  My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing 
              and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're 
              livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my 
              poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor 
              family."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk 
              by. I'll be right back. "
"jerry"," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. "
"jerry"," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello."
"jerry"," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?"
"jerry"," Oh, poor Blossom. "
"jerry"," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman."
"susan"," David Letterman's on the floor?"
"jerry"," Yeah, he just walked by. "
"jerry"," Yeah, good idea."
"jerry"," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas."
"jerry"," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell 
              you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' 
              there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very 
              funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for 
              the table.  Because we've all been in 
              that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... 
              and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?"
"jerry"," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea 
              where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance 
              and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You 
              know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, 
              he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of 
              those big neck collars."
"george"," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful 
              or what? Hey, sorry I'm late.  Russell?"
"george"," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to 
              see you. Jay, always a pleasure.  Sweetie.  Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, 
              that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought 
              I was getting the butler."
"jerry"," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you."
"jerry"," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?"
"george"," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time 
              I should probably break the Prozacs in half."
"kramer"," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy."
"jerry"," Would you give him the TV back?"
"kramer"," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
"george"," I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over 
              there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? "
"kramer","  Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!"
"susan"," Hello?"
"george"," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?"
"susan"," What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going 
              on. I'm fired!"
"george"," Fired? Why?"
"susan"," Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! 
              Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone."
"kramer","  What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again."
"george"," But I had no... I didn't realize."
"susan"," You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! 
              You're a stupid, stupid man!"
"george"," I just feel terrible This is just terrible."
"kramer","  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed."
"susan"," I'll speak to you later."
"george","  this is great! He fired her! 
              This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!"
"jerry"," Why did he fire her?"
"george"," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, 
              he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!"
"kramer"," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!"
"jerry"," You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. 
              You got her fired. You gotta be there for her."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," You gotta at least wait until she gets another job."
"george"," Another job?"
"jerry"," Couple of interviews."
"george"," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think 
              I'm out, they pull me back in. "
"jerry"," What? Leave? Where? Why?"
"jerry"," Why would I leave? This is my apartment."
"jerry"," Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?"
"jerry"," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has 
              to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I 
              mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole 
              structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was 
              in bad shape."
"jerry"," What else did you say to her?"
"elaine"," Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope."
"jerry"," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another 
              cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent."
"elaine"," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe 
              me."
"jerry"," What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with 
              you?"
"elaine"," You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served 
              with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. 
              You better be nice to her."
"jerry"," I was trying to be."
"elaine"," Look at George.  He 
              lucked out, huh?"
"jerry"," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break 
              up with him? They had a good thing going."
"elaine"," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family 
              cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, 
              and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had 
              a real good thing going."
"george"," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm 
              writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now."
"jerry","  Let me ask you a question."
"elaine"," Mm-hm."
"jerry"," You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-"
"elaine","  Who, me?"
"jerry"," You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're 
              chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think 
              they would ever consider doing"
"elaine","  They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
"kramer","  You! Take off your socks, 
              your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it 
              off, take it off!"
"kramer"," Hey, Georgie."
"jerry","  What's the matter?"
"george","  My mother caught me."
"jerry"," ""Caught"" you? Doing what?"
"george"," You know.  I was alone.."
"elaine","  You mean..?!"
"george","  Uh-huh."
"kramer","  She caught you?"
"jerry"," Where?"
"george","  ..I stopped by the house 
              to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody 
              was there - they're supposed"
"jerry"," ""Glamour""?"
"george"," ..So, one thing lead to another.."
"jerry"," So, what did she do?"
"george"," First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My 
              God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started 
              clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it."
"george"," I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, 
              or zip up."
"jerry"," What did you do?"
"george"," I zipped up!"
"elaine","  So, she fell?"
"george"," Yeah.  Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!"
"elaine"," No, I guess you couldn't have.."
"jerry","  No, I wouldn't 
              think so."
"elaine","  ..done that."
"george"," So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My 
              back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
"elaine","  How is she?"
"george","  She's in traction."
"elaine","  Ok, I'm sorry."
"george"," It's not funny, Elaine."
"elaine","  I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious."
"george"," Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of 
              days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, 
              why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's"
"jerry"," ""Glamour""?"
"george","  Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never 
              doing.. that , again."
"elaine"," What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?"
"george","  All together."
"elaine"," Oh, gimme a break.."
"jerry","  Ohhh yeah.. right."
"kramer"," Oh, like you're gonna stop?"
"george"," You don't think I can?"
"jerry"," No chance."
"george","  You think you could?"
"jerry"," Well, I know I could hold out longer than you."
"george"," Care to make it interesting?"
"jerry"," Sure, how much?"
"george"," A hundred dollars."
"jerry","  You're on."
"kramer","  Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in 
              on this. "
"jerry"," You?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," You'll be out before we get the check."
"elaine","  I want to be in on this, too."
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry","  It's apples and oranges.."
"elaine"," What? Why?  
              Why?"
"jerry"," Because you're a woman!"
"elaine"," So what?"
"jerry"," It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man."
"elaine","  Oh."
"jerry"," We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, 
              uh.. shaving."
"elaine"," Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
"kramer","  Not everyday."
"george"," Alright, look, you want to be in?"
"elaine"," Yeah!"
"george"," You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta 
              put up two-hundred dollars."
"kramer"," No, a thousand!"
"elaine"," No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
"george"," Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
"jerry","  Okay, one-fifty."
"george"," Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?"
"jerry"," Well, obviously, we all know each other very well,  I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within 
              the confines of the honor system."
"kramer"," Alright. "
"george","  No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I 
              don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, 
              I'll see you later. Yes, of course"
"jerry","  ..Yeah?"
"george","  Whatever."
"jerry"," How is she?"
"george","  She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital 
              to see her tonight."
"jerry","  Yeah?"
"elaine"," It's me."
"jerry"," Come on up. "
"george"," Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
"jerry","  Dating Marla."
"george"," Oh, the virgin?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
"jerry"," Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just 
              waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
"kramer"," Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across 
              the street."
"jerry"," Where?"
"kramer"," Second floor from the top.  See the window on 
              the left?"
"george","  Wow!"
"jerry","  Who walks around the house like that?!"
"george","  Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist 
              colony people.."
"kramer"," ..Yeah..  yeah.. "
"jerry"," Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, 
              do they eat naked in the dining room?"
"george"," I would imagine it's all naked."
"jerry"," What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?"
"george","  They're naked, the gardeners 
              naked.. the bellhops.  One 
              big nude-a-rama."
"elaine"," Hey."
"elaine"," Well,  where's my money? Who caved?"
"jerry","  Not me."
"george","  Not me."
"elaine"," What're you looking at?"
"jerry"," There's a naked woman across the street."
"elaine","  This is gonna be the easiest money 
              I've ever made in my life.  So, my fried, 
              Joyce, is teaching an aerobics"
"jerry","  Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it 
              back."
"elaine","  So 
              then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to 
              go on the space shuttle. We're goin'"
"jerry","  Uh-huh."
"george"," Have a good time."
"kramer","  I'm out!"
"elaine"," What?!"
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest."
"george"," You're out?!"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah..  what?"
"elaine"," Well, that was fast!"
"jerry"," Well, it was that woman across the street.  You 
              know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks 
              out, shutting the door"
"elaine"," ..And then there were three."
"elaine"," I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing 
              better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a 
              quart of milk, I come home, and find"
"george","  Ma."
"george"," Ma, people can hear you."
"george","  Alright, Ma, that's enough!"
"george"," No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!"
"george","  Because I don't want to."
"george"," Well, I am not going."
"george","  Is that important, really? What is this, a police 
              investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive 
              the experience now?!"
"george","  Yeah.. television."
"elaine"," Oh, it's been a while."
"elaine","  Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched."
"elaine"," Why is that?"
"elaine","  Oh, my God.  John F. Kennedy 
              Junior's here!"
"elaine","  In my class? John Kennedy's 
              gonna be in my class?!"
"elaine"," Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt."
"jerry"," ""Slow it down""?"
"jerry"," Ah, yeah.. I know."
"jerry"," Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about 
              the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean 
              anything to me.  I don't"
"jerry","  Sure, Saturday night."
"jerry"," Goodnight.  Not 
              just a good night - a great night. "
"kramer","  Goood Moorrrnninng!"
"jerry","  Yeah, good morning."
"kramer"," Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. "
"jerry"," She's not there. She's doin' her wash."
"kramer","  Oh. So, did you make it through 
              the night?"
"jerry","  Yes, I'm proud to say I did!"
"kramer"," So, you're still master of your domain."
"jerry","  Yes. Yes I am.  Master of my 
              domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to  her apartment, and"
"kramer"," Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?"
"jerry"," I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't 
              sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. 
              Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in"
"kramer"," Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?!  This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, 
              and you want to tell her to"
"jerry","  Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way."
"kramer","  No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This 
              is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, 
              looking through our"
"jerry"," Look, I'm sorry-"
"kramer"," No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry."
"jerry"," Kramer,  get outta my way!"
"kramer","  No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my 
              sake! God knows I don't ask you for much!  Now, come on. 
              Please, Jerry. Please! I'm"
"jerry"," Alright.. "
"kramer"," Yes!"
"jerry"," ..Alright."
"kramer","  Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
              "
"jerry"," She's not there!"
"kramer"," Oh, I can wait.."
"jerry"," So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?"
"george"," Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then 
              I got a look at the patient..  I was going 
              nuts."
"jerry"," Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital."
"george","  Well, my mother, Jerry.."
"jerry","  But are you still master of your domain?"
"george","  I am king of the county. You?"
"jerry"," Lord of the manor."
"elaine"," John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!"
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine","  He was in my aerobics class."
"jerry"," Really? Did you talk to him?"
"elaine"," No, you don't understand - he was working out right in 
              front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk 
              to the door so we'd get there at"
"george"," ""Quite a workout""? What did you say?"
"elaine","  I said, ""yeah."""
"jerry","  Good one."
"elaine"," So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, 
              and I saw him again, on the way out.  
              So we're walkin' and"
"jerry"," But the question is, are you still master of your domain?"
"elaine","  I'm queen of the castle. "
"george"," Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's 
              in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit."
"george"," You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?"
"george","  You got it, Ma.  A 
              little later. "
"george"," Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?"
"george","  I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a 
              little time with you."
"george"," Ten minutes! Here, here,  Have some Tic-Tacs."
"george","  Hang on, Ma.. hang on.."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine"," No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. "
"elaine","  What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an 
              impression? What impression?"
"elaine"," No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!"
"elaine","  He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about 
              me?!  What 
              did he say?"
"elaine","  What situation? I have a situation?"
"elaine"," That was good. That was very good."
"elaine","  Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to 
              hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt 
              me."
"jerry"," Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm 
              watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid 
              shows. They have a very innocent,"
"kramer","  Oh, that's 
              good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. 
              (Jerry looks back at"
"jerry","  The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, 
              round and round. The"
"kramer"," The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, 
              nothing on.."
"george"," All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real 
              coffee?"
"jerry"," I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the 
              outside!  Yeah?!"
"elaine","  It's Elaine."
"jerry","  Come on up! "
"george"," Where did you get those socks?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"george"," I think those are my socks!"
"jerry"," How are these your socks?!"
"george"," I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just 
              like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!"
"jerry","  Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep 
              one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They 
              looked so good to me, I just had to"
"george"," Yeah, well, they're my socks!"
"jerry"," They're my socks!"
"george"," Oh boy.."
"jerry"," What are we doing here.."
"george"," ..Oh boy."
"jerry"," This is ridiculous."
"george"," Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting."
"jerry"," I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody."
"george"," Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street."
"elaine"," Hello.. "
"george","  You caved?!"
"jerry"," It's over?"
"george"," You're out?"
"jerry"," Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead."
"george"," I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"elaine"," It was..uh.. John-John."
"jerry"," But you made it through the day before."
"elaine"," Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, 
              that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight."
"jerry"," Why outside here?"
"elaine"," Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a 
              cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."
"jerry"," Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me."
"george"," And then,  there were two."
"elaine","  Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior.."
"jerry"," Really?"
"jerry"," You sure?"
"jerry"," You really want to?"
"jerry"," Okay.."
"jerry","  You don't know the half of it."
"jerry"," Well, it's kinda silly, but.."
"jerry"," No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with 
              George and his mother-"
"elaine"," Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-"
"elaine"," What happened?"
"jerry"," I told her about the contest."
"elaine"," Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o."
"george","  Hey, what happened?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," I thought you were meeting Kennedy."
"elaine","  He didn't show."
"george"," Yeah, he did."
"elaine"," What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, 
              I gotta go.."
"george"," No, no, no. He just left."
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Yeah, he was talking to Marla."
"jerry"," Marla?"
"george"," Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he 
              was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and 
              they just drove away."
"elaine","  He left with Marla, the virgin?"
"george"," Yeah."
"elaine"," They drove away?"
"george"," Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You 
              know, he's - he's-"
"jerry","  Oh my God in heaven!"
"elaine","  Is that..?"
"george"," Kramer?!"
"elaine"," He's waving.."
"george"," I loved her Jerry, I loved her. "
"jerry"," No, you didn't."
"george"," And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did."
"jerry"," No she didn't."
"george"," What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. 
            I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?"
"elaine","  Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like 
            her."
"george"," Who says? "
"elaine"," You did."
"george"," Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love 
              with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest 
              of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment 
              watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around 
            with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry."
"jerry"," You walk around with no underwear?"
"george"," Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?"
"jerry"," I do a wash."
"george"," Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, 
            Jerry. No one's better than her."
"jerry"," When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her."
"george"," I loved her! "
"jerry"," You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being 
            taken to a cell."
"george"," I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.            "
"george"," I gotta call her. Should I call her?"
"jerry"," George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?"
"george"," Whyie?"
"jerry"," You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see 
            Elaine's friend? She's a therapist. "
"george"," I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe 
            with."
"jerry"," No, no no  Elaine what's 
              the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the 
            woman."
"elaine"," Dana Folley."
"jerry"," Right, Dana Folley."
"george"," She any good?"
"elaine"," Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?"
"george"," Wa, uh, ..."
"elaine"," Tia? Who's that? "
"jerry"," She's the model I met on the plane."
"elaine"," She sent you a Christmas card? "
"jerry"," Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night."
"george"," My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!! "
"jerry"," What are you doing?"
"elaine"," ... date with Fred."
"jerry"," The religious guy?"
"elaine"," He's not THAT religious."
"jerry"," Let us pray."
"kramer"," Hey, you got any Double Crunch?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Kramer, should I call Susan?"
"kramer"," Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta 
            listen to the little man."
"george"," My little man doesn't know."
"kramer"," The little man knows all. "
"george"," My little man's an idiot."
"elaine"," See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a 
            card. I should do that. I never do anything like that. "
"kramer"," You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can 
            do that for you. ..."
"george"," She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.            "
"elaine"," No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture 
            on a card."
"kramer"," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything."
"george"," She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what 
            she put in those eggs. "
"kramer"," All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal 
            and I'll take your picture."
"elaine"," Really? Can you really take a picture?"
"jerry"," Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment 
            over there."
"elaine"," All right, ha ha "
"kramer"," I don't know about that outfit though. "
"elaine"," Why? What's wrong with it?"
"kramer"," Well, we'll have to improvise."
"george","  Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful 
              girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my 
            baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ..."
"jerry"," George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.            "
"jerry"," So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right 
            here."
"jerry"," Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush 
            them down the toilet."
"jerry"," What's that perfume you're wearing?"
"jerry"," What is that smell?"
"jerry"," It smells like the beach."
"jerry"," Oh my God is that the new perfume? "
"jerry"," I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea 
              for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive 
            at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea."
"jerry"," And you're the model for this perfume?"
"jerry"," Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door "
"kramer"," Hey"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey, how ya' doing? "
"jerry"," Yeah, uh, I'll see you later. "
"kramer"," I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster."
"jerry"," All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait 
            here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia."
"kramer"," Hello."
"kramer"," How tall are you?"
"kramer"," Come on lets see - Back to Back."
"jerry"," NO! Kramer!"
"kramer"," What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall 
            she was."
"jerry"," Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference 
            who's tall. We're all tall."
"kramer"," What's that? "
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," That smell. What's that smell?"
"jerry","  What smell?"
"kramer"," It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very 
            familiar."
"jerry"," Oh, they're all the same. Here.  
            Now if you'll excuse us, .."
"kramer"," Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?"
"jerry"," Okay."
"kramer"," Yeah. Nice meeting you."
"jerry"," I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Ooow, that was close."
"kramer","  THE BEACH!!!"
"kramer"," You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? 
            you're wearing."
"kramer"," CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole 
              my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell 
            like you just came from the beach."
"jerry"," I know look at this "
"kramer"," Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp 
              he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. 
              I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not 
            going to get away with this."
"george"," Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, 
              uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with 
              my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with 
              me  and uh, well, I was the cause 
              of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with 
            this thing?"
"george"," Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down? "
"george"," What is with this damn zipper?"
"george"," It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth 
            out."
"george"," This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, 
            ..."
"george"," ... Susan."
"george"," UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new 
            jacket."
"elaine"," Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work 
            for that Church on Amsterdam."
"jerry"," Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday 
              season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped 
              by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at 
              what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't 
            have to go to all that trouble."
"elaine"," It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing."
"jerry"," I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?"
"elaine"," Well, you know. It's a picture?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job."
"elaine"," Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?"
"jerry"," ... um ..."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Did you look at look at this picture carefully?"
"elaine"," Carefully?"
"jerry"," Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong 
            but I think I see ... a nipple."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Here. Take a look. What, what is that?"
"elaine","  Oh my God! That's my nipple. "
"jerry"," That's what I thought."
"elaine"," That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card 
            to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa. "
"jerry"," DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?"
"elaine"," Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You 
              know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide 
              your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their 
            own personal shot of it. "
"kramer"," Hey!"
"elaine"," Have you seen the card? "
"kramer"," What card?"
"elaine"," This car."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it."
"elaine"," Well did you notice anything unusual about it?"
"kramer"," No."
"elaine"," Well come here and take a look. "
"kramer"," Yeah, so?"
"elaine"," So, what's that?"
"kramer"," That's a nipple."
"elaine"," Right!!"
"kramer"," Ooo!"
"elaine"," Aw, great!? Didn't you see that? "
"kramer"," Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh, "
"elaine"," It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt. "
"jerry"," Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let 
            me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it."
"elaine"," No. I don't want him looking."
"jerry"," Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.            "
"elaine"," Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. 
              My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. 
            Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred."
"jerry"," Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything 
            unusual about it."
"jerry"," Okay. Thanks."
"jerry"," No. "
"jerry"," What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. 
            What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them. "
"kramer"," I got them too. "
"jerry"," Everybody's got them. "
"george"," Pull it up a little bit."
"george"," Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate. "
"george"," Take it right off the chest..."
"george"," You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it."
"george"," Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. 
            ... Oh,Elaine?"
"george"," "
"jerry"," No, No, No, No, Oh, No."
"jerry"," Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned 
            one call. "
"george"," Was it a scratch or a pick? "
"jerry"," It was a scratch. "
"george"," Hey. It's me."
"jerry"," Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and 
            a scratch? "
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"elaine","  It's me. "
"jerry"," Come on up. "
"george"," Was there any nostril penetration?"
"jerry"," There may have been some incidental penetration. But from 
            her angle she was in no position to make the call. "
"george"," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so 
            then what?"
"jerry"," Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? 
            Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? "
"george"," I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh 
              the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me 
            you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. "
"jerry"," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody 
              and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue 
            going out with her?"
"george"," No. That's disgusting! "
"elaine"," You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is 
              plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... 
              Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep 
              asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy 
              I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ...  
            Oh please!"
"george"," Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody 
              else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good 
            friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it. "
"elaine"," You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All 
              right here.  Here's your Christmas 
            card. "
"kramer"," Got any Double Crunch?"
"jerry"," yeah. I think I do. "
"kramer"," What's that perfume?"
"elaine"," What, Ocean."
"kramer"," That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that 
            model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN."
"jerry"," I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me 
            in a pick at a light."
"kramer"," I thought you said it was a scratch. "
"jerry"," But that's not what she thinks. "
"george"," Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of 
            town and she didn't get the calls. "
"jerry"," All right. I'll call the agency.  Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. 
              Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. 
              well thank you very much.  She has been in town. She's 
            at CALVIN KLEIN's right now."
"kramer"," Let's go. "
"george"," It'll be different this time. "
"susan"," I need someone a little more stable."
"george"," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, 
              you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these 
              glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? 
            Costanza! "
"susan"," People don't change."
"george"," I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled 
              egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there 
            and I'm loving it. "
"susan"," I'm not a soft boiled egg. "
"george"," And I am not a piece of toast. "
"susan"," I just don't think we have anything in common. "
"george"," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his 
              wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the 
              cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, 
              consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in 
            the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. "
"susan"," Why were there so many cockroaches? "
"george"," Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. 
              Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments 
             "
"susan"," And they got along?"
"george"," Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. 
            He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!"
"kramer"," I want to talk to Calvin."
"kramer"," Let me talk to Calvin."
"kramer"," Yeah, uh."
"kramer"," I'm here to talk about the ocean. "
"kramer"," Now I don't want any trouble Calvin. "
"jerry"," Hello there you are."
"jerry"," Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been 
            returning my calls."
"jerry"," Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, 
              an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that 
            you caught me (flustered, he"
"jerry"," But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril."
"jerry"," But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There 
            ws no piick!"
"jerry"," No! No pick!"
"kramer"," All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came 
            in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.."
"kramer"," Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach 
            cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me."
"kramer"," Well, yeah."
"kramer"," You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what 
            I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose."
"kramer","  Oh?"
"elaine"," I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took 
            it."
"elaine"," Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button 
            it."
"elaine"," Oh, you've never missed a button?!  Yeah?.."
"elaine"," Oh, God - my nephew.  
            Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is."
"elaine"," Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me ""Nip""!  It was 
            an accident! Well.."
"jerry"," An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, 
              and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending 
            myself but all those"
"elaine"," I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish 
              now that I had!  Because it is not me that has 
            been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!"
"jerry"," The pick?"
"elaine"," The pick?"
"george"," She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You 
            should have seen the look on her face. "
"jerry"," I think I've seen that look. "
"kramer"," I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out."
"jerry"," Boy, they really worked on your pectorals. "
"george"," Your buttocks are spectacular. "
"elaine"," Oh my!"
"kramer"," What? "
"elaine"," I'm not sure but... I think I see your..."
"jerry"," What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? 
              Didja "
"jerry"," You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another 
            "
"jerry"," And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out 
              the "
"jerry"," No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate''"
"jerry","  Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... "
"george"," Excuse me, do you have a ticket?"
"george"," Okay. Good."
"jerry"," What are &lt;you&gt; doing here?"
"elaine"," I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''."
"george"," Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy."
"elaine"," ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!"
"george"," ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!"
"elaine"," Oh, &lt;come on&gt;. That Fountain of Youth scene at the 
              end, where "
"george"," Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror 
              and saw "
"kramer"," Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King."
"george"," You're not going to get back here in time!"
"kramer"," I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!"
"elaine"," You can get a hot dog in the theater."
"kramer"," I don't wanna get a movie hot dog!"
"elaine"," Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then 
              this line is"
"kramer"," Well, just save me a seat."
"elaine"," No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! 
              I once"
"george"," I'm in line to buy."
"elaine"," No, George, this is the ticket-&lt;holders&gt; line."
"george"," No it's not, it's the ticket-&lt;buyers&gt; line."
"elaine"," Then how come we're not moving?"
"kramer"," Good question."
"george"," Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?"
"george"," But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said 
              no!"
"george","  Good. It's good to be accurate like that."
"elaine"," Can you believe him?"
"kramer"," He's spaced out."
"elaine"," How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?"
"kramer"," "
"elaine","  Yeah, exactly..."
"elaine"," I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!"
"george"," It's the same movie! What's the difference?"
"elaine"," It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in 
              POWs to "
"jerry","  Take the Park!"
"jerry"," "
"george"," Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''."
"elaine"," Sigh/Ugh."
"george"," I wouldn't mind seein' &lt;that&gt;."
"elaine"," Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie 
              if"
"george"," So what's your point?"
"george"," By the way, you owe me seven fifty."
"elaine"," Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?"
"george"," No, I don't have any change."
"elaine"," Oh, well, then I'll pay you later."
"george"," Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later."
"elaine"," Yeah, you *could*..."
"george"," Might be easier."
"elaine"," I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe 
              me twelve"
"george"," [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, 
              but we"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," So... Can I have it?"
"elaine"," I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda."
"george"," Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?"
"elaine"," I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even."
"george"," I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy"
"elaine","  George, you're sappin' my strength."
"george"," You go in and save seats."
"elaine","  Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save 
              three "
"jerry"," That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices."
"jerry"," I gotta get out of this cab..."
"jerry"," No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the 
            "
"elaine"," No, these are saved."
"elaine"," What, is that a rule?"
"george"," Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You 
              said you"
"elaine"," "
"george"," Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get 
              change,"
"elaine"," Can we do this later, George?"
"george"," Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly 
            "
"kramer"," Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot 
              eleven, "
"elaine"," No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ..."
"elaine"," These two and this one. ..."
"elaine"," Oh, take 'em."
"george"," Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face,"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Your trench coat in my closet?"
"jerry"," No thanks, maybe some other time."
"jerry"," No, I don't."
"jerry"," No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible."
"jerry"," Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 
              'em."
"kramer"," Hey, did that guy show up?"
"kramer"," No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils."
"elaine","  Excuse me, excuse me."
"elaine"," "
"george"," Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?"
"george","  My `stub'?"
"george"," You don't remember me?"
"george"," I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big 
              wall o' "
"george","  Elaine?"
"george","  Elaine!"
"elaine"," Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?"
"elaine"," What's the difference?"
"elaine","  What happened to the small?"
"elaine"," What's... medium?"
"elaine"," Oh-kay. Gimme the large."
"elaine"," Right. Yeah.  Could I have a small 
              popcorn?"
"elaine"," What's `medium'?"
"elaine"," Do adults ever order the child-size?"
"elaine","  Okay, gimme the `adult'."
"elaine"," Is it *real* butter?"
"elaine","  What is it made of?"
"jerry"," 44th and 9th."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just 
              had "
"george","  I've got 
              the stub."
"george"," There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket."
"kramer"," Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket."
"kramer"," Is that seat taken?"
"jerry"," Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?"
"elaine"," I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... "
"elaine"," No no, I can't sit in the front row."
"elaine"," I can't stand around here for *two hours*!"
"elaine","  Oh. Thanks."
"elaine"," Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... 
            "
"jerry"," Hey, did I make it?"
"jerry"," Oh, great. That's great. What a night."
"jerry"," You got my spot?"
"jerry"," Really..."
"jerry"," Weight? Naw. Just need some more height."
"jerry"," My whole night's ruined."
"jerry"," ``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?"
"jerry","  Minsk?"
"elaine"," Oh, gimme a break!"
"jerry"," Elaine?"
"elaine"," Jerry!"
"jerry"," Elaine!"
"george"," Jerry?"
"jerry"," George?"
"george"," Elaine?"
"elaine"," George! "
"jerry"," Hey, where's Kramer?"
"elaine"," I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!"
"jerry"," Let's get outta here.  I'll see ya."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," I don't want the coat."
"george","  Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum."
"jerry"," I didn't even use the ticket!"
"george"," I still paid for it!"
"jerry"," I only have a twenty."
"elaine"," That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?"
"kramer"," It was on the seat..."
"elaine"," *YOU* took my seat!?"
"george"," You uh owe me for the ticket."
"kramer"," Yeah, right..."
"elaine"," What is that stain ?"
"kramer"," It's yellow mustard.  Can you break a twenty?"
"jerry"," I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the 
              plot."
"jerry"," I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending 
              to be excited"
"george"," Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to 
              live because"
"george"," You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the 
              window and "
"george"," I'm bad. I'm *bad*!"
"george"," So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She 
              threatened"
"elaine"," Over you?"
"george"," Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?"
"george"," I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls""."
"elaine"," I got him a two-line phone."
"jerry"," Unbelievable! She's not there."
"george"," What paper does she write for?"
"jerry"," The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student 
              in "
"elaine"," Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that..."
"jerry"," Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately..."
"elaine","  Really?"
"elaine"," Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?"
"jerry"," Living or all time?"
"elaine"," All time."
"jerry"," Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins 
              and ends "
"elaine"," I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?"
"george"," Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle."
"elaine"," I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up 
              a tree."
"elaine"," Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? 
              I mean you "
"george"," So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man 
              I'll ever love."
"jerry","  What's the matter with you?"
"george","  C'mon, go along..."
"jerry"," I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 
              goose-"
"jerry"," Y'know I hear that all the time."
"elaine"," Hear what?"
"jerry"," That I'm gay. People think I'm gay."
"elaine"," Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too."
"jerry"," Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat."
"elaine"," And you get along well with women."
"george"," I guess that leaves me in the clear..."
"george"," I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become 
              a porno "
"jerry"," Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?"
"george"," Yeah, how did you know that?"
"jerry"," You told me that already like two months ago."
"george"," Allison bought it for me."
"jerry"," How you gonna get out of *that* one?"
"george"," I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die."
"jerry"," He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?"
"george"," Jerry did you wash this pear?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I washed it."
"george"," It looks like it hasn't been washed."
"jerry"," So *wash* *it*."
"george"," You hear the way he talks to me?"
"george"," Jerry said he didn't like it."
"jerry"," I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K..."
"george"," No, you said you didn't like it..."
"jerry"," Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of 
              the world, or"
"jerry"," Actually, we met in the gym locker room."
"george"," Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb 
              the ropes"
"jerry","  Live together?"
"george"," No, I got my own place."
"jerry"," Know *what*?"
"george"," My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on..."
"jerry"," Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping 
              on"
"jerry"," There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole 
              thing "
"george"," No, of course not..."
"jerry"," I mean that's fine if that's who you are..."
"george"," Absolutely..."
"jerry"," I mean I have many gay friends..."
"george"," My *father* is gay..."
"jerry"," It was a *joke*..."
"george"," Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex

"george"," No!"
"jerry"," No steam!"
"kramer"," Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!"
"kramer"," Happy birthday paruba!"
"jerry"," Today's not my birthday."
"kramer"," Well, I beg to differ..."
"jerry"," Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!"
"jerry"," Hey, where you going?"
"elaine"," I gotta go return something..."
"jerry"," Thank you very much, that's great- &gt;click&lt; Oh! Hold

"jerry"," Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper 
              on"
"george"," So, what did she say?"
"jerry"," She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. 
              She "
"george"," Y'know... I could hear you on the other line..."
"jerry"," What are you talkin' about?"
"george"," I heard what you said ""Sharon, are you there?""."
"jerry"," You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?"
"george"," Yes, I heard you!"
"jerry"," Well, maybe she was disconnected."
"george"," Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!"
"jerry"," Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can 
              hear anything,"
"kramer"," Yello?"
"jerry"," Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. 
              &gt;click click&lt;"
"george"," ""There may be a problem with the phone, hold on""!"
"jerry"," Oh no! &gt;click click&lt; Kramer, this phone's a piece 
              of junk, goodbye!"
"george"," ""The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye""!"
"jerry"," Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?"
"george"," Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong 
              with it..."
"jerry"," No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences 
              are "
"elaine"," Thank-you."
"elaine"," So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and 
              then she"
"jerry"," She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either."
"george"," Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep 
              your coat on"
"jerry"," So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU 
              thinks I'm gay."
"george"," Not at all."
"george"," Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go 
              with you!"
"jerry"," ""Guys And Dolls""? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway 
              musical?"
"george"," It's ""Guys And *Dolls*"", not ""Guys And *Guys*""."
"jerry"," ""The Collected Works Of Bette Midler""."
"jerry"," What do you got there?"
"jerry"," ""Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian 
              and his"
"george"," Now everyone's going to think we're gay!"
"jerry"," Not that there's anything wrong with that..."
"george"," No, not at all..."

"kramer"," I thought we were friends..."
"jerry"," Here we go..."
"kramer"," I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?"

"george"," Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!"
"jerry"," Ma, it's not true!"
"jerry"," Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!"
"george"," Yeah. I'm Buck Naked."
"george"," Of course not..."
"george"," Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want 
              to have dinner"
"jerry"," Y'know, I think I'll pass on the ""Guys And Dolls""..."
"george"," No. Just imagine her reaction."
"elaine"," Yeah..."
"george"," Oh, my God..."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna 
              think--"
"george"," Yeah so??"
"george"," Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what 
              that's"
"george"," I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay."
"george"," Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness."
"george"," You don't believe me? Ask Jerry."
"george"," What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is 
              a very "
"jerry"," I dunno...  *Alright*, I forgive you..."
"jerry"," I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane."
"george"," Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!"
"jerry"," What!?"
"george"," You're with a *woman*!"
"jerry"," I know! What are you doin' here?!?"
"george"," I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you 
              do! I "
"jerry","  Would you get the Hell 
              out of "
"george"," Alright, tell her. Go ahead."
"jerry"," Tell her what?"
"george"," Y'know. About *us*."
"george"," Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's 
              Buck Naked,"
"kramer"," We'll see you later..."
"kramer"," He's the *phone* man!"
"kramer"," Not that there's anything wrong with that..."
"jerry"," I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes 
              when "
"george"," Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like 
              me, when"
"jerry"," Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before 
              it'll"
"george"," Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English."
"jerry"," Yeah, how about a mute?"
"george"," A mute would be good."
"jerry"," Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?"
"george"," This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute."
"george"," I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry,"
"jerry"," A deep, yawning chasm..."
"george"," There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you 
              pleasure?"
"jerry"," Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and 
              I'm on"
"elaine"," Hey boys!"
"jerry"," Hey! How you doin'?"
"elaine"," Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow."
"george"," Start what?"
"elaine"," I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens."
"george"," *Really*."
"elaine"," Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel 
              *so*"
"george"," Volunteer work, huh?"
"jerry"," What're you gonna do down there?"
"elaine"," Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment 
              and,"
"jerry"," That's what I do with him "
"george"," When did you get this idea?"
"elaine"," Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* 
              and *on*"
"jerry"," What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on 
              me?"
"george"," And... and anybody can do this?"
"elaine"," Yup."
"george"," Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect 
              sense!"
"elaine","  What about you?"
"jerry"," Nah, it's not for me."
"elaine"," Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you."
"george"," What *kind* of a person are you?"
"jerry"," I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful."
"george"," Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"george"," Hey, what's your guy's name again?"
"jerry"," Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your"
"george"," Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that 
              age?"
"jerry"," *We*? No."
"kramer"," So what's up, Diggity Dog?"
"jerry"," George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer"
"kramer"," Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn 
              you."
"jerry"," What're you talkin' about?"
"kramer"," Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!"
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some 
              money"
"jerry"," Where do you *get* this?"
"kramer"," The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the 
              truth."
"newman"," Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?"
"kramer"," I'm in here. C'mon..."
"jerry"," Hello, *Newman*..."
"newman"," Jerry, George.  So, did you ask him about the 
              records?"
"kramer"," Well--"
"jerry"," What records?"
"kramer"," Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records."
"newman"," You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash 
              for used"

              old-"
"kramer"," Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge."
"george"," Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, 
              Newman?"
"newman"," I'm a United States postal worker."
"george"," Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back 
              with a"

"newman"," Well, you know how much those records are worth!?"
"newman"," Those records are worth more than five dollars!"
"kramer","  He's gyppin' us..."

"kramer","  I don't like it..."
"newman"," I don't like it."
"kramer","  Alright, well be back, jack."

"jerry"," Oh, right... But you *hated* it!"
"george"," Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, 
              do you "
"jerry"," What for?"
"jerry"," Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not 
              doing "
"kramer"," I can't work with these!"

              the room"
"jerry"," Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend."
"elaine"," Well..."
"jerry"," Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role 
              before "
"elaine"," What's with him?"
"jerry"," Y'know a lot of people have asked that..."
"elaine"," Roy!"
"elaine"," Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognise you! You look so..."
"elaine"," A *lot* of weight."
"elaine"," You look ter*rific*."
"elaine"," This is... uh... you *really* lost weight."
"jerry"," Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend."
"kramer"," Ah, the mother lode!"
"elaine"," I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't

"elaine"," *Get* *out*!"
"elaine"," Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks..."
"jerry"," That's terrible..."
"elaine"," I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you."
"jerry"," You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep..."
"elaine"," Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out 
              of here?"
"elaine"," Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you

"jerry"," No I'm not..."
"elaine"," Shut up..."
"kramer"," Pay dirt!"
"elaine"," Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends."
"kramer"," I do great."
"jerry"," Hey Doc, check this out.  I *just*

"kramer"," I sure am."
"kramer"," But you *will* use... a retractor."
"kramer"," Mmm-hmm..."
"kramer"," I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!"

              be friends"
"george"," Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?"
"jerry"," Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and 
              wanted"
"george"," How's the guy?"
"jerry"," Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty 
              chummy."

"george"," Clara Barton? What did she do?"
"jerry"," I'm not sure, but I think she was nice."
"george"," Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with."
"jerry"," Yeah, I think you would."
"george"," So, you gonna buy his art?"
"jerry"," No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars."
"george"," Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta 
              here. "
"jerry"," I will."
"george"," Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing."
"jerry"," No, it isn't. I can find out."
"george"," Yeah? How?"
"jerry"," There are ways."
"jerry"," Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would 
              make fun "
"jerry"," Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?"
"jerry"," Oh... *you*..."
"george"," Now let's try ""breast""... Celeste... Kest...

"jerry"," No."
"george"," Rest... Sest... Hest..."
"jerry"," ""Hest""? That's not a name."
"george"," What, you should've just asked her."
"jerry"," I know, I should've asked her."
"george"," What're you gonna do now?"
"jerry"," I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with 
              her. Once "
"george"," Aretha!"
"jerry"," No..."
"george"," Bovary!"
"jerry"," Alright, that's enough."
"george"," Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go 
              through her"
"jerry"," How am I gonna do that?"
"george"," When she goes to the bathroom."
"kramer"," Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you 
              guys"
"jerry"," You asked a date to go to the operation?"
"kramer"," Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say?"
"george"," What kind of operation is it?"
"kramer"," Spleenectomy."
"george"," Isn't that where they remove the--"
"kramer"," Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!"
"kramer"," C'mon, what d'you say?"
"george"," Mulva!"
"jerry"," Mulva?"
"kramer"," C'mon, do you wanna go?"
"jerry"," Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll 
              go "
"jerry"," What are you eating?"
"kramer"," Junior Mints. Do you want one?"
"jerry"," No..."
"kramer"," I can't see... Psst...."
"jerry"," Where'd you get those?"
"kramer"," The machine. You want one? Here, take one."
"jerry"," I don't want any! "
"kramer"," No, they're good!"
"jerry"," I don't want any! "
"kramer"," Just take one."
"jerry"," No! Kramer, stop it!"
"jerry"," ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into*

              the "
"george"," What do you mean ""into the patient""?"
"jerry"," Into the patient, *literally*!"
"george"," Into the hole?"
"jerry"," Yes, the hole!"
"george"," Didn't they notice it?"
"jerry"," No!"
"george"," How could they not notice it?!?"
"jerry"," Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint."
"george"," What did they do?"
"jerry"," They sealed him up with the mint inside."
"george"," They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?"
"jerry"," Yes!"
"george"," I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those 
              things."
"jerry"," They *eat* them, they don't put them next to vital organs 
              in their "
"kramer"," Hey, this wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like 
              a ski "
"jerry"," Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint!"
"kramer"," Well, I didn't believe you."
"jerry"," How could you not believe me?!?"
"kramer"," Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's 
            "
"jerry"," That's true."
"kramer"," It's very refreshing!"
"jerry"," Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine..."
"elaine"," Prognosis... negative."
"jerry"," Prognosis *negative*!?"
"elaine"," He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. 
              They're "
"elaine"," Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and 
              attractive."
"george"," It's that bleak?"
"elaine"," Mmm..."
"george"," Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something..."
"jerry"," We gotta confess."
"kramer"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yes!"
"kramer"," We could be tried for murder..."
"jerry"," I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and 
              Loeb!"
"kramer"," You're not gonna say anything, you got that?"
"jerry"," I'm telling and you can't stop me!"
"kramer"," You're *not*!!!"
"george"," Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars 
              worth."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, that's the spot..."
"jerry"," Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide. [She finds the right 
              spot "
"jerry"," Mulva?"
"jerry"," My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse."
"jerry"," Oh, good idea..."
"jerry"," Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint."
"jerry"," No!  No, I mean, no thank 
              you..."
"kramer"," Any news?"
"jerry","  No, you better get out of here. No, wait a 
              second..."
"kramer"," 10-4."
"kramer"," Hello, I'm Kramer."
"kramer"," See you later. "
"jerry"," Hey, there's a name you don't forget."
"george"," Hi, I'm George."
"george"," I gave it a shot... So, any word on the ""artiste""?"
"jerry"," No, I haven't heard anything."
"george"," Well, I got my triangles."
"jerry"," Really..."
"george"," Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment."
"jerry"," Yeah, I'm sure..."
"jerry"," Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened."
"george"," No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," You could get in trouble."
"jerry"," Look, I gotta try and help the guy."
"george"," Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his 
              number "
"jerry"," Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's 
            "
"george"," What? What?"
"jerry"," Oh, thats *fantastic*!"
"george"," He didn't get better, did he?"
"jerry"," Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!"
"george"," Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the 
              drain."
"george"," Oh, that's great. That's great."
"kramer"," Y'know, art is a great investment."
"elaine"," It's gonna look great in your apartment, George."
"george"," Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles. 
            "
"jerry"," What do you mean?"
"kramer"," Mint?"
"elaine"," I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos 
              on "
"jerry"," I don't think so..."
"elaine"," We are..."
"jerry"," I believe we're not..."
"elaine","  Please can we 
              go to "
"jerry"," Well, I'll think about it..."
"jerry"," Really..."
"jerry"," Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph?"
"jerry"," Do you have it with you?"
"jerry"," Let me see."
"jerry"," Yeah, I know..."
"jerry"," Yes I do."
"jerry"," It, uh, rhymes with a female body part."
"jerry"," Mulva..."
"jerry"," Gipple?"
"jerry"," Loleola?"
"jerry"," Oh! Oh! *Delores*!"
"jerry"," Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing 
              else."
"jerry"," ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means 
              either you"
"jerry"," Is that bothering you?"
"elaine"," No, not at all..."
"elaine"," Oh, could you please hurry?"
"jerry","  ""Please hurry"". Look at you. Look 
              at what you've "
"elaine"," What? What have I become? I haven't ""become"" 
              anything..."
"jerry"," Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?"
"elaine"," I don't want to keep him waiting..."
"jerry"," He'll like you more..."
"elaine"," That's impossible..."
"jerry"," Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon..."
"jerry"," So, where am I dropping you?"
"elaine"," His place..."
"jerry"," This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and 
              then drop"
"elaine"," *And* he gets the rest of my chicken..."
"jerry"," So, is tonight ""the night""?"
"elaine"," You never know..."
"jerry"," Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!"
"jerry"," Boy, do you smell something?"
"elaine"," Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* 
              I"
"jerry"," What is it?"
"elaine"," I think it's B.O.!"
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O."
"jerry"," It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this."
"elaine"," Jerry. It's *B*.*O*."
"jerry"," But the whole car smells."
"elaine"," So?"
"jerry"," So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays 
              with the ""B"". "
"elaine"," I can't believe you ski!"
"elaine"," Yeah? What else?"
"elaine","  Oh! You ""pillage and plunder""?"
"elaine"," See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages 
              and "
"george"," This'll only take a second."
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm going to poke around..."
"george","  Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* 
            "
"george","  Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?"
"susan"," George?"
"george","  Argh!  Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What 
              are"
"susan"," Renting a video! What do you got there?"
"george"," Oh, ... some stupid movie..."
"susan"," This is Mona."
"george"," Oh, hi..."
"george"," Yes. Well..."
"susan"," You okay?"
"george"," Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time."
"susan"," And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman."
"george"," Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? 
              I "
"susan"," I *know* who I'm talking to."
"george"," Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, 
              uh, "
"susan"," I liked women?"
"george"," There you go."
"george"," So, uh, how long has this been going on?"
"susan"," Since you and I broke up."
"george"," Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?"
"susan"," Yeah."
"george"," Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's 
              very "
"susan"," So, what have you got there?"
"george"," Oh, I, uh--"
"susan"," Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''"
"george"," It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually."
"susan"," Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?"
"george"," No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* 
              nudity."
"george"," Oh, that's me."
"susan"," Alright, well... Good seeing you, George."
"george"," Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with 
              the"
"george","  ``Rochelle, Rochelle''."
"george"," $3.49? It says $1.49."
"george"," What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!"
"kramer"," George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you 
              less to"
"george"," I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it 
              again..."
"jerry"," So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car 
              out. I"
"elaine"," Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours 
              that "
"jerry"," What about skunk?"
"elaine"," I don't mind skunk."
"jerry"," Horse manure?"
"elaine"," I *loooove* horse manure."
"jerry"," Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In 
              fact, I "
"elaine"," Absolutely."
"elaine"," Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, 
              and he "
"jerry"," It means he's lying."
"elaine"," Wow..."
"jerry"," Why? Is that what he told you?"
"elaine"," Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early 
              some"
"jerry"," No. Never."
"elaine"," Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in 
              the morning."
"jerry"," Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but 
              a man will "
"elaine"," Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?"
"jerry"," Anything's *possible*..."
"jerry"," What's the matter with you?"
"kramer"," Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life..."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, Steinbrenner..."
"kramer"," I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. 
              He'll "
"jerry"," I know the list..."
"kramer"," What's that smell?"
"jerry"," What smell?"
"kramer"," Ooooh... You stink."
"jerry"," Whatd'ya mean I stink?"
"kramer"," You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?"
"jerry"," I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've 
              been in "
"elaine"," So?"
"jerry"," Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself 
              to me! "
"elaine"," If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's 
              why Carl"
"kramer"," What happened?"
"jerry"," What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's 
            "
"george"," What is that? B.O.?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," This is *unbelievable* B.O."
"jerry"," I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy 
              told me "
"george"," So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?"
"jerry"," No, no. It's the valet guy."
"george"," No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism."
"jerry"," Oh... No, that's ridiculous."
"george"," What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?"
"jerry"," Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism."
"george"," The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told 
              me she's *never* "
"george"," Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!"
"jerry"," There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like 
              a ""Smell "
"george"," Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing 
            "
"jerry"," Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought..."
"jerry"," Here he is... that's the guy! "
"jerry"," I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?"
"george"," Stinks."
"jerry"," Stinks!"
"jerry"," Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!"
"jerry"," That's from the car!"
"george"," Oh, it's the chicken and the egg..."
"jerry"," Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; 
            "
"george"," Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the 
            "
"jerry"," You've gotta smell the car"
"jerry"," C'mon! One whiff!"
"jerry"," Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?"
"elaine"," Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The ""O"" 
              went from the "
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!"
"george"," Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that 
              perhaps I "
"george"," What $98.00?"
"george"," How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?"
"george"," So, was it me?"
"susan"," Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk 
              to me "
"george"," Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back."
"susan"," Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go."
"george"," Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were 
              ever "
"susan"," You're an idiot."
"george"," Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question."
"susan"," I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real 
              bad."
"george"," It's not me! It's the car!"
"kramer"," I knew you would."
"jerry"," Let's do it."
"elaine"," Tomato Sauce?"
"jerry"," Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!"
"jerry"," It still smells!"
"george"," How could it still smell after all that?"
"jerry"," I don't know!"
"george"," Well, what are you gonna do?"
"jerry"," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!"
"george"," You're *selling* the car!?"
"jerry"," You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force 
              more "
"george"," Maybe I'll buy it."
"jerry"," Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? 
              This"
"elaine"," I still smell!"
"jerry"," You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! 
              It's "
"susan"," Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!"
"jerry"," Susan!"
"susan"," Kramer!"
"jerry"," What is going on?"
"susan"," You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, 
              he burns"
"george"," He stole your girlfriend?"
"susan"," Yes. She's in *love* with him."
"george"," Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back."
"jerry"," That's the *least* of what you've accomplished..."
"elaine"," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on 
              a second."
"kramer"," I'm Kramer."
"george"," I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what 
              they want?"
"susan"," I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*."
"george"," Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet 
              other"
"susan"," You think so?"
"george"," Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian."
"susan"," You're very sweet..."
"george"," Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with 
              you, I"
"susan"," Really?"
"george"," Yeah, you're just so... hip."
"george"," Oh, my God..."
"susan"," What?"
"george"," It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed 
              with me."
"george"," Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?"
"george"," Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, 
            "
"susan"," Nice to meet you... "
"susan"," Thank you..."
"kramer"," I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my 
              apartment;"
"jerry"," '90."
"kramer"," Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing 
              she "
"jerry"," That's strange..."
"jerry"," 23 000."
"kramer"," And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, 
              I'm "
"jerry"," Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The 
              Beast!"
"jerry"," This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!"
"elaine"," Sauce me."
"jerry"," Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything 
              in "
"george"," I can't believe this!"
"jerry"," Oh, it won't be for that long."
"george"," How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? 
              Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that."
"jerry"," Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents."
"george"," How can you compare you parents to my parents?!"
"jerry"," My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!"
"george"," My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!"
"jerry"," My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water."
"george","  Listen carefully. My mother has never 
              laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never 
              went 'Ha!'"
"jerry"," A smirk?"
"george"," Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!"
"jerry"," I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent."
"george"," No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having 
              sex. It just completely changes the relationship."
"kramer"," Alright. I'm ready.  You know, I still don't 
              understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?"
"george"," I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left 
              in the bank."
"kramer"," Well, move in here."
"jerry","  What's that?"
"kramer"," Why doesn't he just move in here?"
"george","  Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He 
              doesn't even let you use the toilet!"
"kramer"," You can move in with me, if you want."
"george","  Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out."
"kramer"," Hello, Mrs. Costanza."
"kramer"," Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. "
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"george","  There's more."
"jerry"," Fine, Mrs. Costanza.  
              Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.."
"jerry"," No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-"
"george"," Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!"
"jerry"," No thanks."
"kramer"," Uhh.. no thanks. "
"jerry"," I really don't eat it."
"jerry"," I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna 
              sandwiches in the building.."
"kramer","  Alright, that's it. Anything else?"
"george","  No, that's it."
"kramer"," Oh, I gotta go move the car. "
"jerry"," Well, I guess we'll be going.. "
"george","  What? You're 
              going?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Wha - what are you doing later?"
"jerry"," Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and 
              his new girlfriend."
"george"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. 
              You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse 
              me?', 'what was"
"george"," Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?"
"george","  Oh.. okay.. talk to you later."
"jerry"," Yeah, take it easy. "
"george"," Oh, my God.. "
"elaine"," Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you 
              make your own pie! "
"jerry"," Right."
"kramer"," Yeah, well, that was a good one."
"jerry"," Well.."
"elaine"," What's that?"
"jerry"," Excuse me?"
"jerry"," Yeah.. yeah."
"elaine"," Yep. Yeah.."
"kramer"," You know that, uh, Leslie  is in the clothing 
              business? She's a designer."
"elaine","  Oh?"
"kramer"," In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to 
              be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt.  Well, yeah,"
"elaine"," Oh, a puffy shirt."
"jerry"," Puffy."
"kramer"," Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You 
              know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care.."
"kramer","  That's true..  I'll be right 
              back. "
"elaine"," Uh, oh!  Jerry's 
              going to be on the ""Today"" show on Friday."
"jerry"," Yeah, that's right!"
"elaine"," Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you 
              know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless.."
"jerry","  And the indigent."
"elaine"," And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. 
              I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it."
"jerry"," Sure."
"elaine"," Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"elaine"," Yep."
"jerry"," Yep.."
"elaine"," Mmm"
"george","  I'm not taking a civil service 
              test."
"george"," Yes, I've seen a silver dollar."
"elaine"," Why don't you want to take a civil service test?"
"george"," To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want 
              me to do?"
"george"," I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?"
"george"," I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent 
              - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!"
"george","  Oh my God.."
"george","  I need 
              some air.."
"george","  I got a lot of thinking to do."
"george"," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. "
"george","  I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you.."
"george"," It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother 
              wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, 
              I don't even think I'd pass it.. So.."
"george"," What?"
"george"," What about them?"
"george"," They are?"
"george"," Hand modeling? "
"jerry","  I - I don't get it."
"george"," Me neither!"
"jerry"," What is it?"
"george"," I don't know."
"jerry"," They're hands!"
"george"," This woman just set me up for a job!"
"jerry","  Well, what about my 
              hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands."
"george"," What, are you kidding?  The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over 
              there - where do you get off"
"jerry"," Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your 
              whole life."
"george"," This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in 
              the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take 
              it any more. I got up, and (Makes a"
"kramer"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey, George! "
"george"," What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!"
"kramer"," What?!"
"george"," You coulda damaged my hand!"
"kramer","  But, it's only a toy!"
"jerry","  George has become a hand model."
"kramer"," A hand model?"
"jerry"," Yes."
"kramer","  Really? Let me look at them.."
"george","  You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. 
              "
"kramer"," Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed 
              this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet  
              masculine."
"george","  Alright,  I gotta get going."
"jerry"," Oven mitts?"
"george","  That's all I could find.  
              Would you mind getting the door?"
"kramer"," Yeah.."
"jerry"," Alright. "
"george"," Thank you very much. "
"kramer"," You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. 
              You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today 
              show, she's been getting"
"jerry"," Uh-huh..  
              Since I said what?"
"kramer"," Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. "
"jerry"," What are you talking about?"
"kramer"," When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt 
              on the Today show. "
"jerry","  This?"
"kramer"," Yes!"
"jerry"," I agreed to wear this?!"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah."
"jerry"," But, when did I do that?"
"kramer"," When we went to dinner the other night."
"jerry"," What are you, crazy?!"
"kramer"," What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?"
"jerry"," I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! 
              I was just nodding!"
"kramer"," There you go."
"jerry"," Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous 
              shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!"
"kramer"," Yes, yes! You said it!"
"jerry"," But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't 
              hear her!"
"kramer","  Well, she asked 
              you."
"jerry"," I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at 
              it! It looks ridiculous!"
"kramer"," Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking 
              it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV 
              show! The factory in New"
"jerry"," They're making these?!"
"kramer"," Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, 
              - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the 
              first pirate!"
"jerry","  But, I don't want to be a pirate!"
"george","  Hand me an Emory 
              board."
"george","  Scissor.  Don't hand them to me with the point 
              facing out! "
"george"," You're sorry?!"
"george","  I hope so. "
"george"," Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. 
              Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important 
              photo session in the"
"george","  I'll take it in my room. "
"kramer"," Yeah, come in."
"kramer"," Giddy-Up.  Jerry! Five minutes!"
"kramer"," Now that's a great looking shirt!  Ayye Captain!  Yeah! I'm glad I ironed 
              it. It's perfect. (Walks around"
"jerry","  Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear 
              this!"
"kramer","  Hey, this look's better than anything you 
              own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing 
              the  pirate"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said 
              he might help out at the benefit!"
"kramer"," Great."
"elaine","  What is that?!"
"kramer"," It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is 
              it cool or what?"
"elaine","  Why're you wearing that now?"
"jerry","  'Why am I wearing 
              is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker 
              asked me to, that's why!"
"elaine"," When did she,  when did she ask you this?"
"jerry"," When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom."
"elaine"," I didn't hear anything."
"jerry","  Of course not! Nobody hears anything when 
              this woman speaks!"
"elaine","  Well, you can't wear 
              that on the show."
"kramer","  Elaine, you 
              want to stop?"
"elaine","  Wha- What? No.  
              Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You 
              can't come out"
"jerry","  I have to wear it! The woman has 
              orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing 
              them as we speak!"
"elaine","  Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate 
              person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. 
              swing in on a"
"george"," Who was he?"
"george","  What happened to him?"
"george"," You mean, uh..?"
"george","  But 
              how.. uh..?"
"george","  You don't have to worry about me. 
               I won a contest."
"jerry","  Thank you, Bryant."
"jerry","  Oh, thank you."
"jerry"," Yeah, it's a puffy shirt."
"jerry"," So, does he like you? "
"elaine"," What do you think? "
"jerry"," You like him? "
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a 
              lot. "
"george"," What's wrong with him? "
"elaine"," Nothing, and I've looked. "
"george"," Well, I'm sure you'll find something. "
"jerry"," So, how did you meet him? "
"elaine"," In the office. "
"jerry"," So, he's a writer. "
"elaine"," Yeah. "
"jerry"," Yeah, big surprise. "
"elaine"," So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking 
              pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps. "
"george"," What are those? "
"elaine"," Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, 
              so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through 
              his thumb and his forefinger"
"jerry"," So, what did you do? "
"elaine"," I said ""So, what do you think?"". And he said, 
              ""Gabardine?"". And I said, ""Yeah."" That was it. 
            "
"george"," Wow, just felt your material? "
"elaine"," Yeah...Jake Jarmel. "
"george"," Sounds like a cool guy. "
"jerry"," Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on. "
"george"," Jerry, where did you get that sweater? "
"jerry"," What do you think? I found it at the back of my closet. 
            "
"george"," I think that's what the back of closets are for. "
"elaine"," Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. "
"jerry"," Hey... "
"elaine"," Hi. "
"george"," Who's that? "
"jerry"," That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant. "
"george"," I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money. 
            "
"elaine"," Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. 
              He just does my taxes. "
"jerry"," Hey Barry, how you doing? This is my friend George. "
"elaine"," Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood? "
"jerry"," Yeah, so how's my money? "
"jerry"," What, you got a cold? "
"elaine"," Wow, look at that ring. "
"jerry"," Bathroom, bathroom is right over there. "
"jerry"," Did you see that? "
"elaine"," See what? "
"george"," Yes, I saw that. "
"jerry"," What was all that sniffing? "
"elaine"," I don't know. "
"jerry"," You don't think...? "
"elaine"," Oh, no! Come on Jerry. "
"george"," He was definitely sniffing. "
"jerry"," I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. 
              Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write 
              checks to himself right out of my account. "
"elaine"," I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs. 
            "
"jerry"," Then, what was all that sniffing? "
"elaine"," Maybe it's the cold weather. "
"jerry"," Today is not cold. "
"george"," All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting 
              me. "
"elaine"," Don't forget to wash your hands before supper. "
"george"," This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could 
              have as much as I want. "
"george"," Next Friday, what time? "
"george"," That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers. 
            "
"george"," I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know? "
"george"," Do we have to...? "
"george"," They are made from lycra-spandex. "
"george"," She doesn't want to get a bra. "
"george"," All right, it wouldn't kill me. "
"george"," I-I know about the cups. "
"george"," I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on 
              knowing that the D is the biggest. "
"george"," I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. "
"kramer"," Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing? "
"jerry"," Sniffing, with his nose. "
"kramer"," Jerry, he probably had a cold. "
"jerry"," No, I asked him. "
"kramer"," So, what are you saying? "
"jerry"," I don't know, you know, what if...? "
"kramer"," Drugs? You think he's on drugs? "
"jerry"," I don't know. All I know he was sniffing. "
"kramer"," Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together. "
"jerry"," I know. "
"kramer"," And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this 
              guy. We trusted you. "
"jerry"," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just 
              means he was sniffing. "
"kramer"," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? 
              Did he use the word 'man'? "
"jerry"," No, he didn't use 'man'. "
"kramer"," I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ? "
"jerry"," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. "
"kramer"," Whoh! "
"jerry"," Do you think that's a bad sign? "
"kramer"," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! 
              All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money 
              back, right? "
"jerry"," I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it? 
            "
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"elaine"," Hello.... hello, oh... "
"elaine"," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making 
              dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man. "
"elaine"," Did anyone call? "
"elaine"," Where are they? "
"elaine"," Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! 
              Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? "
"elaine"," She did? Oh, that's so great! "
"elaine"," In the drawer on the right. Hmm... "
"elaine"," Oh it's nothing. "
"elaine"," It's nothing. "
"elaine"," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation 
              point? "
"elaine"," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", 
              but you didn't use an exclamation point. "
"elaine"," So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it 
              curious. "
"elaine"," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and 
              I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point. 
            "
"elaine"," You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an 
              exclamation point. "
"elaine"," I just thought you would be a little more excited about 
              a friend of mine having a baby. "
"elaine"," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like 
              the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points 
              at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! 
            "
"jerry"," You're out of your mind you know that. "
"elaine"," What? "
"jerry"," It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under 
              it. "
"elaine"," Well, I felt a call for one. "
"jerry"," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. 
              I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. 
            "
"elaine"," I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. "
"jerry"," George was right. Didn't take you long. "
"kramer"," Anything new on that guy on drugs? "
"elaine"," He's not on drugs. "
"kramer"," Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff* 
              sniffing? "
"elaine"," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing 
              right now. "
"jerry"," Good idea. "
"jerry"," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. "
"jerry"," Out of town? "
"jerry"," South America? "
"kramer"," South America? "
"jerry"," I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! "
"kramer"," Yyyeeaaah!! "
"elaine"," So what? "
"jerry"," Who goes to South America? "
"elaine"," People go to South America. "
"jerry"," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large 
              intestine. "
"elaine"," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an 
              entire continent? "
"jerry"," Yes, I'm impugning a continent. "
"kramer"," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! "
"newman"," Hey, hey... "
"jerry"," Hello Newman. "
"newman"," Hello Jerry. So, any news? "
"kramer"," Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America! 
            "
"newman"," South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us 
              mixed up with? "
"elaine"," Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. 
              This is all speculation and hearsay. "
"kramer"," Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. 
              You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. "
"elaine"," What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and 
              dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean 
              come on... "
"jerry"," Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and 
              find out... "
"newman"," If we put our three heads together we should come up with 
              something. "
"kramer"," What's today? "
"newman"," It's Thursday. "
"kramer"," Really? Feels like Tuesday. "
"newman"," Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, 
              Sunday has a feel.... "
"kramer"," I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... "
"jerry"," All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. 
              Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. "
"newman"," Hey, you know this is kind of fun. "
"kramer"," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... "
"jerry"," Yeah maybe you should. "
"kramer"," Maybe I will. "
"newman"," Yeah, me too. "
"jerry"," All right, what are you gonna say to him? "
"kramer"," Just gonna find out if he's interested. "
"newman"," Hey, hey maybe I should go with him? "
"jerry"," No, you stay in the car. "
"newman"," Who made you the leader? "
"jerry"," All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out 
              of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar. "
"kramer"," All right, I'm going in. "
"jerry"," Be careful Kramer. "
"newman"," I've should've gone in with him. "
"jerry"," No, you stay here in the car. I may need you. "
"newman"," What you need me in the car for? "
"jerry"," I might need you to get me a soda. "
"kramer"," I'll have a brewsky , Charlie. "
"kramer"," Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh? 
            "
"kramer"," Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then 
              again, I've been known to do a lot of things. "
"kramer"," Cigarette? "
"kramer"," I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good 
              all the time. "
"kramer"," Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh? 
            "
"kramer"," Me neither. "
"jerry"," You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 
            "
"newman"," I use dental tape. "
"jerry"," You should try this. "
"newman"," I don't wanna. "
"jerry"," Not even once? "
"newman"," No. "
"jerry"," You're an idiot. "
"newman"," Why, because I use dental tape? "
"jerry"," Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. "
"kramer"," South America? "
"kramer"," That's importuning continent. "
"kramer"," Tell me about it. "
"kramer"," I'm hip. "
"kramer"," To the whole scene. *sniff* "
"kramer"," The bathroom scene. *sniff, sniff* "
"newman"," No, no I don't like it. "
"jerry"," What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like 
              it? "
"newman"," I like the thick tape. "
"george"," Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much 
              indeed, sir. "
"george"," No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, 
              top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled. 
            "
"george"," Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. 
              His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked 
              it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way 
              or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres. "
"george"," They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups 
              in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it? "
"george"," Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed. "
"george"," If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8. "
"george"," So long, Mr. Farkus. "
"george"," Oh, nothing... "
"elaine"," You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman? "
"elaine"," Yes, krhm, yes I did. "
"elaine"," Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and 
              intensity. "
"elaine"," Right, well... "
"elaine"," That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't 
              like to be ch-ch-chilly... "
"elaine"," Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you 
              keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt* 
              nothing comes out... "
"elaine"," Ok, ok ok ... "
"elaine"," ...ok I'll just.... "
"jerry"," 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination 
              of our relationship effective immediately.' "
"kramer"," Exclamation point. "
"elaine"," You still have no proof. "
"kramer"," Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. "
"jerry"," 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later 
              than the 18th'. "
"kramer"," Double exclamation point! "
"newman"," Will that take care of ours too? "
"jerry"," Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back. 
            "
"newman"," Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway. 
            "
"jerry"," Yeah, thanks. "
"newman"," It'll be my pleasure. "
"newman"," See'ya later. "
"jerry"," You know this... "
"kramer"," Hey, Ralph. "
"jerry"," Hi Ralph. "
"jerry"," All right. "
"kramer"," Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry? "
"jerry"," Yeah. "
"kramer"," What's the matter? You've got a cold? "
"kramer"," It's a sweater. "
"kramer"," I don't know, Jerry gave it to me. "
"jerry"," Mohair, I think. "
"jerry"," You mean you just started sniffing? "
"jerry"," I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry 
              came in. "
"kramer"," Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar. "
"elaine"," The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he 
              wasn't a drug addict. "
"jerry"," Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all 
              over it! "
"kramer"," Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. "
"jerry"," The what?? "
"newman"," After you. "
"george"," So what, what is so bad about that? "
"elaine"," You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. "
"jerry"," Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 
            "
"elaine"," What is this? "
"jerry"," It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. "
"elaine"," He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why 
              is he filing a chapter eleven? "
"jerry"," Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and 
              spent it on drugs! "
"elaine"," What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater. "
"kramer"," All right, What about the money? "
"jerry"," What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship 
              with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the 
              money back. Which I"
"newman"," Pair of bear claws, please. "
"jerry"," Think so? "
"jerry"," Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong? 
            "
"jerry"," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. 
              Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that 
              we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't 
              see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the 
              players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy 
              scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two 
              points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll 
              be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, 
              shh."""
"jerry"," Are these seats unbelievable or what?"
"george"," Where's the sunblock?"
"jerry"," Here."
"george"," 25? You don't have anything higher?"
"jerry"," What, are you on Mercury?"
"george"," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
"jerry"," You got a problem with paba?"
"george"," Yes, I have a problem with paba."
"jerry"," You don't even know what paba is."
"george"," I know enough to stay away from it."
"george"," So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?"
"jerry"," I'll go if someone else drives. You going?"
"george"," Gwen really wants to go."
"jerry"," You're bringing a date to a party?"
"george"," No good?"
"jerry"," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're 
              with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and 
              talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate.  
              Ho, ho, ho."
"george"," Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk 
              to?"
"jerry"," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross 
              dressing. Seems like an interesting guy."
"george"," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. 
              Todd introduced us, I'm obligated."
"jerry"," That woman is absolutely stunning."
"george"," The Croat? "
"jerry"," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful 
              lineswoman I've ever seen."
"george"," Yeah, she's a B.L."
"jerry"," B.L.?"
"george"," Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession 
              stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry?  Jerry?"
"elaine"," You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?"
"elaine"," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver 
              will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem 
              he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
              always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that 
              would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, 
              and the driver is way up there on the stage. "
"elaine"," I guess that could work."
"kramer"," Hey, hey, it's George."
"elaine"," Pardon me?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back 
              here. So..."
"elaine"," I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf."
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," It can be very frustrating."
"elaine"," An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know 
              you gotta live your life."
"jerry"," I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman 
              is absolutely mesmerizing."
"george"," Boy you are really smitten."
"jerry"," I gotta talk to her. What do you think?"
"george"," Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those 
              guys."
"jerry"," I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that 
              just walk across the hot coals."
"george"," They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the 
              other side."
"jerry"," I have to. I won't be able to live with myself."
"george"," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you 
              go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here 
              on this side. Take me with you."
"jerry"," I can't."
"george"," What are you going to say?"
"jerry"," I don't know, ""Hi""."
"george"," You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? 
              You're not going to make it."
"elaine"," Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love 
              him."
"elaine"," Yeah. Yes it does..."
"elaine"," No no, no no."
"jerry"," Excuse me.  Excuse me?  Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. 
              Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've 
              got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too 
              good for everyone, but it's women like you  oh well, what are you deaf?"
"kramer"," And you're saying she's deaf."
"jerry"," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf."
"kramer"," Can't hear a thing."
"jerry"," Can't hear a thing."
"kramer"," And you're going to go out with her."
"jerry"," Yeah, isn't that something?"
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey I know how to sign. "
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us 
              for about a year.  So I haven't been able 
              to do it in a while."
"elaine"," What is this about?"
"jerry"," I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match."
"elaine"," You are kidding. That is amazing.  I just took a car service from work and 
              to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf."
"jerry"," Wow good plan."
"elaine"," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, 
              but I'm not a terrible person."
"elaine"," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get 
              out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to 
              injure them like other people. "
"jerry"," That's nice."
"elaine"," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever 
              stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because 
              I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."
"jerry"," That's nice for the freaks."
"elaine"," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie 
              so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy 
              or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?"
"jerry"," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about 
              that friend of yours that works at the ticket area."
"kramer"," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. 
              Like a rock concert. Whatever you like."
"elaine"," Oh, thanks Kramer."
"kramer"," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you 
              see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. 
              I would love to be able to do that."
"jerry"," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key 
              aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There 
              are no ball men."
"elaine"," Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man."
"kramer"," Well there ought to be ball men."
"jerry"," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man 
              go ahead, break the ball barrier."
"elaine"," Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw 
              George at the tennis match on TV yesterday."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating 
              a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing 
              that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real 
              nice and tight. And he's... "
"george"," I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? 
              Something must have happened."
"george"," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells 
              me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
"george"," You're *damn* right it's me."
"george"," I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better 
              than me."
"george"," Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find 
              out."
"jerry"," But I thought things were going great."
"george"," Yeah so did I."
"jerry"," Did she say why?"
"george"," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine."
"jerry"," But that's your routine."
"george"," Yeah. Well aparently word's out."
"kramer"," Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday."
"george"," Really? At the tennis match?"
"kramer"," Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae."
"george"," Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there."
"kramer"," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they 
              made a couple of cracks about you."
"george"," Cracks? What were they saying?"
"kramer"," That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking 
              about how funny you looked."
"george"," Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it."
"kramer"," Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight."
"george"," She must have seen me eating it on TV."
"jerry"," So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends 
              it? You really think she would be that superficial?"
"george"," Why not. I would be."
"jerry"," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice 
              cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. "
"george"," You're parents saw me on TV?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?"
"kramer"," It felt like 8 seconds."
"george"," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
"elaine"," I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape 
              it?"
"george"," Can we move on?"
"jerry"," He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating 
              the ice cream on TV."
"elaine"," Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her."
"george"," Yes I do."
"elaine"," So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday."
"george"," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there."
"kramer"," Well she should be the one that shouldn't go."
"jerry"," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral 
              place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? "
"kramer"," Excellent question."
"jerry"," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the 
              breakee. He needs to get on with his life."
"elaine"," I beg to differ."
"jerry"," Really."
"elaine"," He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong 
              the spoils."
"jerry"," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want 
              to fight that traffic on Friday night."
"elaine"," Well we can take the car service from my office."
"jerry"," Really?"
"elaine"," Yeah, they don't know."
"kramer"," All right, I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Okay."
"george"," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you 
              going to do tonight?"
"jerry"," Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman."
"george"," Oh. "
"jerry"," Why?  Well what 
              are you doing?"
"george"," Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want 
              to tag along with you or anything."
"jerry"," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?"
"george"," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh,  
              where would we be going?"
"george"," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no 
              napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that 
              concession stand cost me a relationship."
"jerry"," Let's get the check.  Is this considered 
              signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know 
              a sign, that's my first sign."
"george"," They're breaking up? How do you know?"
"jerry"," She reads lips."
"george"," What are they saying now?"
"george","  Oh my gosh, I just 
              had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read 
              Gwen's lips for me."
"jerry","  What?"
"george","  We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen 
              is saying about me."
"jerry","  She's not a novelty act, 
              George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas."
"george","  Look. It's 
              a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off."
"jerry","  I don't know George. I'm 
              not sure about this."
"george","  Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case 
              closed."
"jerry","  All right."
"jerry"," Uh Laura, George was wondering if..."
"jerry"," So I really had a good time."
"jerry"," So you want to go to the party on Friday night?"
"jerry"," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by 
              and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. 
              . You got a problem with six? . What? What? "
"kramer"," I may be old, but I'm spry."
"kramer"," Oh I'll be up for it punk."
"jerry"," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying 
              ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though."
"george"," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" 
              then how is she going to lip read from across the room?"
"jerry"," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close."
"george"," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and 
              ""eh""."
"jerry"," Eh."
"george"," It seems like a problem."
"jerry"," Well I'm not dating any other deaf women."
"kramer"," Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals."
"jerry"," You're kidding."
"kramer"," Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls 
              with such gusto."
"george"," When is that car service comming?"
"jerry"," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're 
              going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there."
"george"," If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how 
              incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your 
              friend."
"jerry"," I know. It's like X-ray vision."
"george"," If we could just harness this power and use it for our 
              own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
"newman"," I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You 
              gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day."
"jerry"," Can't do it Newman."
"newman"," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post 
              office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about 
              me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me 
              two hours."
"jerry"," Not going to happen."
"newman","  All right, all right. All right you go ahead. 
              You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you 
              control the mail, you control... information."
"jerry"," Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign."
"jerry"," I said pull over by the stop sign."
"kramer"," -ca."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," ca."
"george"," ah."
"jerry"," You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so 
              I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night."
"jerry"," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs,  check, and  late. Hey this is the 
              guy you helped become the first ball man."
"kramer"," She doesn't know what she's talking about."
"george"," Hey hey."
"george"," Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up 
              with me?"
"george"," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You 
              should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll 
              even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no 
              chance of me overhearing anything."
"george","  Let's go, let's go. All right what are 
              they saying?"
"kramer"," ""Hi Gwen, hi tide."""
"jerry"," Hi tide?"
"kramer"," Hi Todd."
"kramer"," ""You've got something between your teeth"""
"george"," What?"
"kramer"," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love 
              carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea 
              soup."" So do I."
"elaine"," She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow 
              afternoon?"
"jerry"," No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody."
"kramer"," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."""
"george"," What?"
"kramer"," ""You want me to sleep with you?"""
"kramer"," He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, 
              oh boy, ""love to."""
"george"," So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are 
              going to sleep together?"
"kramer"," ""What? You're crazy."""
"george"," I heard your whole conversation."
"kramer"," ""How?"""
"george","  I can read lips. You said let's 
              sleep together."
"kramer"," ""... with a broom, cleaning up."""
"george"," Sweep?"
"kramer"," ""Yes sweep."""
"george"," Cut it."
"kramer"," George says ""Cut it."""
"george"," Cut it."
"kramer"," George is saying ""Cut it."""
"george"," Cut it.   Would you stop 
              signing? She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep 
              together."""
"kramer"," I know how to sign."
"george"," Ow. My eye, my eye."
"elaine"," It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in 
              the finals."
"jerry"," I know and on the first tournament of her comeback."
"jerry"," Thus ends the great ball man experiment."
"george"," Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious."
"george"," I enjoy understanding."
"george"," I want you to have this job. Of course..."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"george"," That's it."
"jerry"," What do you mean that's it?"
"george"," He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was 
              the end of the interview."
"jerry"," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said?"
"george"," Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check 
              with my associates."""
"elaine"," ""I want you to have this job, of course the Board 
              of Directors is under indictment and will be"
"jerry"," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a 
              prerequisite."""
"george"," All right."
"elaine"," Why don't you go ahead and call him?"
"george"," Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything 
              immediately. That's what"
"jerry"," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose 
              the job."
"george"," And if I don't call..."
"jerry"," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind 
              of company is it?"
"george"," Rest stop supply."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey."
"jerry"," Shower?"
"kramer"," Haircut."
"jerry"," Who'd you use? Gino?"
"kramer"," Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair."
"elaine"," What butcher?"
"kramer"," The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses."
"jerry"," Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. 
              I'd hurt his feelings."
"elaine"," You never get good haircuts."
"kramer"," You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's 
              there all by himself."
"jerry"," Really?"
"elaine"," Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one 
              to look good for my bachelor"
"kramer"," What bachelor auction?"
"elaine"," Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors 
              for charity."
"kramer"," And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money 
              to cure polio."
"jerry"," I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time."
"kramer"," Polio?"
"elaine"," Will you go ahead? You need a haircut."
"jerry"," Okay."
"kramer"," What are you all dressed up for?"
"george"," I had a job interview."
"kramer"," Yeah. How'd it go?"
"george"," Good. Of course..."
"jerry"," Oh hi Enzo."
"jerry"," No, actually I was just..."
"jerry"," Well I, if it's your day off I really... "
"jerry"," Well I don't want to take too much off."
"george"," He massacred you. You look like you're five years old."
"jerry"," What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps."
"george"," You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this 
              relationship."
"jerry"," I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. 
              Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd"
"george"," You gotta do it."
"jerry"," I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart."
"kramer"," No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo."
"jerry"," He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there."
"kramer"," So what?"
"jerry"," I didn't want to hurt his feelings."
"kramer"," His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying 
              yourself. I'm not going to let "
"jerry"," No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that."
"kramer"," I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're 
              going to get that haircut fixed up."
"jerry"," I don't want you to call him."
"kramer"," All right, geez. You're crazy."
"george"," So I still haven't heard about that job."
"jerry"," Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about 
              that?"
"george"," I have an idea."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"george"," I show up."
"jerry"," What do you mean you show up?"
"george"," I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. 
              If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't"
"jerry"," Hmm. Not bad."
"george"," What's the worst thing that could happen?"
"jerry"," Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a 
              large group of people and have to walk out"
"george"," Yeah, so?"
"george","  Good morning. Good morning. 
              Good morning. Hi nice to see"
"george"," The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. 
              I was wondering if you could tell"
"george"," Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard."
"george"," Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start 
              his vacation."
"george"," Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just 
              take the small office."
"george"," Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. 
              I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love"
"george"," Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait 
              to sink my teeth into that. Wow that "
"jerry"," So what did you do there all day?"
"george"," They gave me the Pensky file."
"jerry"," So it's a nice place to work?"
"george"," You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers 
              are really taking to me. "
"george","  I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was 
              Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet "
"jerry"," What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?"
"george"," He'll be back on Monday."
"jerry"," Hi."
"elaine"," Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?"
"jerry"," I got a haircut."
"elaine"," Oh yeah? Can I see it?"
"jerry"," Oh there's nothing to see."
"elaine"," Come on. Let me see it."
"jerry"," Forget it."
"elaine"," Come on."
"jerry"," All right."
"elaine","  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"jerry"," Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to 
              that bachelor auction."
"elaine"," What? No Jerry, you have to go."
"george"," You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day."
"elaine","  Yeah, too bad."
"kramer"," It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it."
"kramer"," I'd like to have shoehorn hands."
"kramer"," Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix 
              the haircut."
"elaine"," Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction."
"jerry"," Yeah, but how am I..."
"kramer"," No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock."
"elaine"," Can he fix it?"
"kramer"," I don't know."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"jerry"," Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while."
"jerry"," That's nice of you to say."
"jerry"," In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really 
              good."
"kramer"," Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it."
"jerry"," Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor."
"kramer"," Yeah, so?"
"jerry"," I think he knew."
"kramer"," No. He doesn't know."
"jerry"," Who do you know? He knows my hair."
"kramer"," Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a 
              thing. Now come on. Pull yourself "
"jerry"," Okay, okay."
"elaine"," What happened? It looks the same."
"jerry"," He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost 
              got caught."
"elaine"," Jerry, the auction is in a few hours."
"jerry"," Take the K-man."
"elaine"," You can still go."
"kramer"," What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque."
"elaine"," You think?"
"kramer"," Do I think? He's repugnant."
"elaine"," What would you wear?"
"kramer"," Whatever it takes."
"newman"," Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to 
              barber school. I always felt I had a talent "
"newman"," Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special."
"newman"," It's okay. A little crooked."
"newman"," What's the catch?"
"newman"," Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* 
              free haircuts. And a comb."
"george"," Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?"
"george"," Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring 
              the contents of the file into this"
"george"," He's on vacation."
"george"," Well you know in college they used to call me the little 
              bulldog."
"george"," Really?"
"george"," Not now Florice."
"george"," I am aware. I am aware."
"jerry"," How do you know?"
"jerry"," Who is it?"
"newman"," It's Newman."
"jerry"," All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go 
              out the fire escape."
"jerry"," What do you want?"
"newman"," Can I use your bathroom?"
"jerry"," What's wrong with yours?"
"newman"," My toilet's clogged."
"jerry"," You can't unclog it?"
"newman"," No."
"jerry"," Did you ask Kramer?"
"newman"," He's out."
"jerry"," Number one?"
"newman"," Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly."
"jerry"," All right. Flush twice."
"newman","   No.  
              Jackpot. I don't believe this."
"jerry"," You all right?"
"newman"," Yeah, yeah."
"jerry"," All right, I'll see you later."
"newman"," What are you doing?"
"jerry"," I'm watching Edward Scissorhands."
"newman"," Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie."
"jerry"," Yeah all right."
"jerry"," You want something to drink?"
"newman"," No."
"jerry"," If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. 
              I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of "
"newman"," Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel "
"newman"," It was a cinch. Where are you going?"
"elaine"," Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard 
              graduate."
"elaine"," A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a 
              thousand three times, sold to the lucky"
"elaine"," Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's 
              uh, he's a high school graduate."
"kramer"," Equivalent."
"elaine"," Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. 
              He's uh, self-employed. He's..."
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do 
              I hear, uh, five bucks? "
"jerry"," I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be 
              like a super hero, like Green Lantern or "
"jerry"," Who is it?"
"jerry"," Oh my god, he knows.  Go.  One second."
"jerry"," No I wasn't there."
"jerry"," Sample?  Newman. Uh, I was there but I 
              was just dropping off a book."
"george"," Mr. Tuttle, you're back."
"george"," You are?"
"george"," Oh. Really."
"george"," Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace."
"george"," Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office."
"george"," You are aware that Pensky is interested in me."
"george"," Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle."
"george"," Obviously."
"jerry"," You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. 
              But "
"george"," Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is 
            "
"george"," Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. 
              You know "
"george"," We do?"
"george"," Why?"
"george"," Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster 
              isnt the way "
"jerry"," Then he asked you out?"
"elaine"," We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then 
              he put his "
"jerry"," On your heart?"
"elaine"," Jerry, the man is a doctor."
"jerry"," Doctor? Hes a podiatrist."
"elaine"," Its the same thing."
"jerry"," Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry 
            "
"elaine"," Really?"
"jerry"," Oh hi."
"jerry"," Yes, Ill be stopping. See you later.  Well 
              we cant all "
"george"," Its over."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," How did you get in?"
"george"," Kramer."
"elaine"," Whats that?"
"george"," Lobster."
"jerry"," Looks like a swan."
"george"," She says we cant go out anymore."
"elaine"," Why?"
"george"," Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont 
              let her get "
"elaine"," Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster."
"jerry"," Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad."
"george"," I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats 
              not "
"elaine"," Mmm, delicious."
"jerry"," Mmm, succulent."
"george"," She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at 
              home. Didnt seem "
"elaine"," Why dont you just ask her parents?"
"george"," I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, 
              In the cab on the "
"jerry"," To Latvian Orthodox?"
"george"," Why not? What do I care?"
"jerry"," You know its not like changing toothpaste."
"elaine"," I think it would be romantic."
"george"," Really?"
"elaine"," Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne 
              and marrying "
"george"," King Edward. King Edward, Jerry."
"jerry"," Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank 
              and Estelle "
"george"," You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the 
              difference."
"elaine"," George I was just kidding around."
"george"," No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise 
              her."
"elaine"," George I wasnt serious."
"george"," How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have 
              a "
"elaine"," I guess this one is my fault."
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"jerry"," Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work 
              at it. When I "
"jerry"," To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange. "
"jerry"," Right there."
"jerry","  ""Fungicide"". Fungus?"
"jerry"," Fungicide. I mean what could she have?"
"elaine"," I dont know."
"kramer"," Fungus."
"elaine"," So what did you say?"
"jerry"," I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I 
              had to go "
"elaine"," What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?"
"jerry"," I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little."
"elaine"," You were snooping."
"jerry"," I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was 
              no breaking "
"kramer"," I would. I always open medicine cabinets."
"elaine"," Well I trust people not to do that."
"kramer"," Big mistake."
"jerry"," Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?"
"elaine"," What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist."
"jerry"," But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. 
              Theyre knee-"
"elaine"," I am not going to ask him about funguses."
"kramer"," Fungi."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Fungi."
"george"," *ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man 
              begins to ask "
"george"," No."
"george"," No not vast "
"george"," Yes."
"george","  I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn 
              religious "
"george"," Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know 
              the basic "
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and 
              the "
"george"," Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, 
              am I in?"
"george"," Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious 
              to become a "
"george"," Nice nun."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza."
"kramer"," Oh yeah."
"kramer"," Oh. Kramer. Pleasure."
"george"," I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually 
              Orthodox. All I have "
"jerry"," Thats all there is to it."
"george"," Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will 
              be Brother "
"jerry"," And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother 
              Costanza?"
"george"," Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence."
"jerry"," Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?"
"kramer"," Sister Roberta gave it to me."
"jerry"," Why did she give you that?"
"kramer"," I think she liked me."
"jerry"," What do you mean she liked you?"
"kramer"," *Liked* me."
"george"," Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people."
"kramer"," No. I think I picked up on a vibe."
"jerry"," You picked up on a vibe, from a nun."
"kramer"," Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And 
              I have no control "
"jerry"," Oh hi."
"jerry","  A little better. *fake cough*"
"jerry"," Okay. All right bye."
"george"," Story."
"jerry"," Shes subletting Carols place for a month."
"george"," She likes you."
"jerry"," Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide 
              in her "
"george"," So?"
"jerry"," So I dont know what shes using it for."
"george"," Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged 
              to Carol. "
"jerry"," I didnt even think to look."
"george"," Well take a look. It might not even belong to her."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet."
"jerry"," Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine."
"george"," I still have brill cream."
"jerry"," Hi. Can I use your bathroom?"
"elaine"," You sure you dont mind?"
"elaine"," Well the question isnt even for me its for 
              a friend."
"elaine"," Well podiatrist."
"elaine"," No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to 
              medical school, you "
"elaine"," I like feet too. Im just saying"
"jerry"," Fine all done, just looking for the soap."
"jerry"," No I dont see it."
"george"," What? Nothing."
"george"," Im fine."
"george"," Nothing."
"george"," No."
"george"," No!"
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill 
              need that in the "
"george"," I dont know. I cant believe theyre making 
              me take this test."
"jerry"," Hey, did you talk to the doctor?"
"elaine"," No."
"jerry"," All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He 
              presents the "
"elaine"," You *took* her medicine."
"jerry"," Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the 
              tube. When "
"elaine"," I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how 
              podiatrists "
"jerry"," How could you say that?"
"elaine"," Its you fault. You just got me thinking."
"jerry"," I was merely speaking extemporaneously."
"elaine"," Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot."
"jerry"," Me too."
"elaine"," Do you think I should call him and apologize?"
"jerry"," Yes. Hes a doctor."
"jerry"," Wait a second."
"jerry","  What are you doing?"
"george"," What does it look like Im doing?"
"jerry","  ""Matthew, 
              Luke, Paul"", what "
"kramer"," I told you."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," I told you she liked me."
"jerry"," Who?"
"kramer"," Sister Roberta."
"jerry"," How do you know?"
"kramer"," She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up 
              all of these "
"george"," Oh, Im Im full of it Father."
"george"," Oh, I understand."
"kramer"," Um, you wanted to see me Father?"
"kramer"," I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. 
              I just "
"kramer"," Kavorka?"
"kramer"," I dont understand."
"kramer"," Help me Father. Help me."
"jerry"," What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to 
              Kramers "
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. What are you doing?"
"kramer"," Ive got the Kavorka Jerry."
"jerry"," The Kavorka? Whats that?"
"kramer"," The lure of the animal. Im dangerous."
"jerry"," What is this thing around your neck?"
"kramer"," The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar."
"jerry"," You know youre funcifying the whole building."
"kramer"," Keep away Jerry. Keep away."
"jerry"," Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer."
"george"," For a woman."
"george"," No its a regular religion."
"george"," I dont want to get out of it."
"george"," No no."
"jerry"," Good. Whats the matter?"
"jerry"," Bonkers?"
"jerry"," Oh its your cat! "
"jerry"," Ooh, nothing."
"george"," Yes faddah."
"george"," What?"
"george"," I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous."
"kramer"," How you doing?"
"kramer"," Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got 
              time to catch "
"elaine"," *kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. Im a big fan 
              of the foot."
"elaine"," And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie 
              toe."
"elaine"," Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? 
              Youre not "
"elaine"," Ill be right back."
"elaine"," Its right down here to the left. I will meet you 
              right back here."
"jerry"," Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need 
              the tube "
"kramer"," You dont?"
"kramer"," Yeah yeah."
"george"," Well I didnt do it for my mother."
"george"," Latvia?"
"george"," Enjoy, enjoy."
"george"," Id like a doggie bag for this please."
"kramer"," he asked me"
"elaine"," here, take it"
"elaine"," Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February."
"jerry"," I once got Happy new Year in July."
"elaine"," It's "
"jerry"," It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?"
"elaine"," It's really cold."
"jerry"," Scary cold."
"elaine"," I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?"
"jerry"," That."
"elaine"," Huh, What is that, ha?"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," When did you get that?"
"george"," This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. 
        You know about Gore-Tex?"
"jerry"," You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?"
"elaine"," You can't even turn around in that thing."
"jerry"," Look at this "
"elaine"," Hey George, can you feel this? "
"george"," All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go."
"elaine"," Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine 
        or something."
"george"," What for?"
"elaine"," These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something."
"george"," Why?<br/>
        ELAINE Because it's rude, otherwise."
"george"," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're 
        going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?"
"jerry"," The fabric of society is very complex George."
"george"," I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi."
"elaine"," You can't bring Pepsi."
"george"," Why not?"
"elaine"," Because we're adults?"
"george"," You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine 
        is better than Pepsi."
"jerry"," I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there 
        and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table."
"george"," I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner 
        invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it."
"jerry"," You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself."
"kramer"," All right, let's go. Who's driving?"
"jerry"," You are. I can't get that thing  in my car."
"jerry"," Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm 
        cold. Give me a squeeze."
"elaine"," Get off of me. Get off of ME!"
"jerry"," You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?"
"george"," Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat."
"elaine"," I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one 
        bottle of wine."
"george"," Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice 
        sectional."
"elaine"," We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?"
"george"," Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?"
"elaine"," Ring Dings?<br/>
        GEORGE Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a 
        bakery."
"kramer"," I like Ring Dings."
"elaine"," George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and 
        Pepsi."
"kramer"," HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON!"
"george"," It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show 
        up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People 
        be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about 
        the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais 
        and Chardonnay . . . "
"elaine"," Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. 
        Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is"
"jerry"," Jerry."
"elaine"," Yeah, Jerry, come with me."
"kramer"," Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here 
        in ten minutes."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"kramer"," All right"
"elaine"," Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries."
"jerry"," Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and 
        white. Two races of flavor living side by side  It's a wonderful 
        thing isn't it?"
"elaine"," You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile."
"jerry"," I'm looking forward to it."
"elaine"," Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you."
"jerry"," Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'? 
      "
"elaine"," CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty."
"jerry"," Love that Bobka."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah!"
"jerry"," So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the 
        cake box."
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the 
        little string."
"elaine"," You think it's effeminate? "
"jerry"," It's a tad dainty."
"elaine"," Oh, we forgot to pick a number."
"jerry"," You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people."
"elaine"," You think I should go ask her for hers?"
"jerry"," No, forget it."
"elaine"," No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't 
        mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and 
        them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me."
"kramer"," Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?<br/>
        GEORGE Just double park"
"kramer"," No"
"george"," Why not?"
"kramer"," I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out 
        of here?"
"george"," Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give 
        them up. "
"kramer"," It's a fallacy."
"george"," All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store 
        and I'll wait in the car? "
"kramer"," Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?"
"george"," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get 
        cold. "
"kramer"," So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll 
        be on."
"george"," Does the heater even work in this car?"
"kramer"," No."
"george"," Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see"
"kramer"," I see."
"george"," You see, ho ho, "
"elaine"," But we were here ahead of you."
"jerry"," Well we saw you come in."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I 
        make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries."
"elaine"," Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?"
"elaine"," Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember 
        we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower."
"elaine"," Me too."
"elaine"," Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?"
"elaine"," You know we were here ahead of you."
"jerry"," Oh so you still don't believe us."
"elaine"," Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are."
"george"," So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!"
"kramer"," What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?"
"george"," What's that?"
"kramer"," It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which 
        is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars."
"george"," Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee 
        you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake."
"kramer"," All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't 
        have my wallet."
"george"," . . . Why not?"
"kramer"," Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's 
        bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter "
"george"," ""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? 
      "
"kramer"," I never take it."
"george"," So what do you do?"
"kramer"," Oh, I get by."
"elaine"," /JERRY See you later."
"jerry"," That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka."
"elaine"," I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka."
"jerry"," That was our Bobka."
"elaine"," You can't beat a Bobka."
"jerry"," We should have had that Bobka."
"elaine"," They're going to be heroes. "
"jerry"," What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole 
        thing's useless."
"elaine"," Well how about a carrot cake?"
"jerry"," Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into 
        a cake. I'm sorry."
"elaine"," Black Forrest? "
"jerry"," Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh."
"jerry"," How about a Napoleon? "
"elaine"," Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. 
        Might as well get Mengle. "
"jerry"," That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!"
"elaine"," What's this one?"
"jerry"," Another Bobka?"
"jerry"," Well, we've got to get the cinnamon."
"elaine"," No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser 
        Bobka."
"jerry"," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People 
        love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and 
        pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" 
        The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. 
        Lesser Bobka - I think not."
"elaine"," I'll have the cinnamon Bobka. "
"jerry","  and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!"
"george"," All right here you go."
"george"," You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go."
"kramer"," Wait a second. I can get change."
"kramer"," Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?"
"george"," Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed."
"kramer"," What?"
"george"," Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be 
        jumping out of windows after us."
"kramer"," Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change."
"george"," I am not buying something just to get change."
"kramer"," George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on."
"kramer"," All rright let's get some gum or something."
"george"," Pack of gum, okay here you go."
"george"," Why not?"
"kramer"," Here, get a newspaper."
"george"," A newspaper."
"kramer"," A Clark Bar."
"george"," Clark Bar."
"george"," There's 22 dollars here."
"kramer"," George, George, Get a Penthouse Forum."
"george"," I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum."
"kramer"," That will make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the 
        letters at the dinner table."
"george"," Oh, that's nice."
"kramer"," Hey, did you ever read one of these?"
"george"," It's not real. They're all made up."
"kramer"," Oh, it's real."
"george"," You know there is an unusual number of people in this country 
        having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark 
        Bar."
"george"," Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now."
"george"," Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex."
"kramer"," You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war. "
"jerry"," Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, 
        is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes 
        better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes 
        us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be 
        solved. "
"elaine"," Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should 
        do an op-ed piece for the Times. "
"jerry"," Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie."
"elaine"," What is this? "
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," It's a hair."
"jerry"," Oh, take it back. Let's get another one."
"elaine"," No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off."
"jerry"," No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second."
"elaine"," Excuse me."
"elaine"," No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake 
        with a hair on it. "
"elaine"," We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH 
        A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing  are you going to wait here?"
"jerry"," Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it."
"elaine"," It was a little hair. I took it off."
"jerry"," A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?"
"elaine"," What if it's your hair?"
"jerry"," What if it's your hair?"
"elaine"," What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care 
        of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head."
"jerry"," Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health 
        food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your 
        roots out."
"elaine"," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number."
"jerry"," Well, why don't we just forget about the cake? "
"elaine"," No I'm bringing cake!"
"george"," All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine 
        if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S 
        YOUR WINE? GET OUT! "
"kramer"," ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but 
        every word of this story is true""  "" 
        A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive 
        our new neighbor Linda was"""
"george"," Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES 
        ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. 
        Can you believe this?"
"kramer"," ""well of course I noticed it too with those ample 
        breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock 
        out."""
"george"," I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. 
        Can you comprehend it?"
"kramer"," No, no I can't comprehend it?<br/>
        GEORGE I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're basically still 
        very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys who 
        built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?"
"kramer"," Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking 
        and blocking somebody in."
"george"," So you really understand my point about building a rocket and 
        double-parking."
"kramer"," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part 
        he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?"
"george"," Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard 
        for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini 
        would circle the block six times looking for a spot?"
"kramer"," How about Idi Amin?"
"george"," Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the 
        death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is 
        not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!"
"kramer"," Are those shoes comfortable?"
"george"," No not really."
"kramer"," They look comfortable."
"george"," I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable."
"elaine"," Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?"
"jerry"," No, out of the question."
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger."
"elaine"," What happened?"
"jerry"," I'd rather not talk about it."
"elaine"," You can't tell me?"
"jerry"," All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out."
"elaine"," You found a hair in your Farina?"
"jerry"," Yeah,"
"elaine"," What happened?"
"jerry"," I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's 
        a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running 
        and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running 
        and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site."
"elaine"," Wow. Who's hair was it?<br/>
        JERRY My mother's."
"elaine"," That's us."
"jerry"," Oh, good."
"elaine"," You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one."
"jerry"," Ah, that's lovely."
"elaine"," Ah,"
"jerry"," Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your 
        hair for some phlegm "
"elaine"," Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?"
"kramer"," HEY DOUBLE-PARKER. SOVIET SCUM. COME ON OUT. IT'S FREEZING!"
"george"," We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble."
"kramer"," Why?"
"george"," You know, Elaine."
"kramer"," What about her?"
"george"," . . . I'm a little scared of her. "
"kramer"," You're scared of Elaine?"
"george"," Yes!"
"kramer"," Why?"
"george"," Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because 
        I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard 
        my head came right through the top of it."
"kramer"," Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here."
"george"," Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?<br/>
        KRAMER Because I wanted to look good for the party."
"george"," Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty 
        minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?"
"george"," I wasn't talking to you."
"elaine"," Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that 
        big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember 
        that Panama hat? That was nothing."
"jerry"," Uh, wa?"
"elaine"," What's the matter with you?"
"jerry"," Uh, I don't feel so good."
"elaine"," What's wrong?"
"jerry"," My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie."
"elaine"," The black and white?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Not getting along?"
"jerry"," I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there."
"elaine"," Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?"
"jerry"," I feel like I'm going to throw up."
"elaine"," Hey, what about your vomit streak?"
"jerry"," I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980."
"elaine"," Oh, oh!"
"elaine"," Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're 
        doing you, LUNATIC! uh, I think he broke my toe.  
        Where're you going?"
"jerry"," Fourteen years down the drain."
"george"," Do chickens have individual personalities?"
"kramer","  I don't care."
"george"," If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the 
        way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? 
        Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should 
        be eating them. What's the matter with you?"
"george"," We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some 
        car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out."
"kramer"," I've got hypothermia."
"elaine"," How was it?"
"jerry"," As good as it gets."
"george"," You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot 
        more than that cheap Chardonnay."
"kramer"," I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking. "
"george"," I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car. 
      "
"george"," Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein."
"jerry"," Oh, no thanks. "
"george"," Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been 
        Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. 
        What, what happened to you? "
"elaine"," Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to 
        put up your ."
"jerry"," Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are 
        you drunk? "
"george"," I had to give it to the liquor store guy."
"jerry"," What for?"
"george"," I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?"
"elaine"," Cinnamon Bobka."
"george"," Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?"
"jerry"," George!"
"elaine"," Here, here's your cake."
"george"," And your wine."
"elaine"," See ya'."
"jerry"," See ya'."
"elaine"," Well did he bring it up in the meeting?"
"jerry"," Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years I've had this T-shirts, 
              it's my "
"elaine"," I'm on the phone here."
"jerry"," Golden Boy is always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry, 
              here"
"elaine"," No thanks. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold."
"jerry"," But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy 
              is slowly "
"elaine"," Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with 
              some "
"jerry"," No!!! The reason he's iron man is because he goes out there 
              and plays"
"elaine"," Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! this is so fantastic! 
              I'm"
"jerry"," The guy in the gulag!"
"elaine"," Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working 
              on it! "
"jerry"," You wanna barrow Golden Boy!"
"elaine"," Oh! Don't you know what this means, it's like working with 
              Tolstoy!"
"jerry"," Hey ya know what I read the most unbelievable thing about 
              Tolstoy the"
"elaine"," Ha ha."
"jerry"," No, no.. I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress 
              didn't like "
"elaine"," But it's a line from that song!"
"jerry"," That's were they got it from!"
"elaine"," Really?"
"jerry"," I'm not joking!"
"george"," You can't handle the truth!"
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the 
              truth!(he "
"elaine"," What, is this your mail? (She takes the mail and starts 
              flipping"
"george"," Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't want my mother reading 
              it."
"elaine"," Oh! Your Alumni Magazine."
"jerry"," Your mother reads your mail?"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What do you mean like post-cards?"
"george"," No, anything."
"jerry"," She doesn't open?"
"george"," She'll open!"
"jerry"," You've caught your mother opening envelopes!"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What did she say?"
"george"," I was curious! "
"jerry"," Isn't that against the law?"
"george"," Maybe I can get her locked up."
"elaine","  Hey Jerry, you're in the 
              Alumni "
"jerry"," He can't handle the truth!"
"elaine"," All right.. this is too fun I gotta get back to work."
"kramer"," Ah, maybe you could use this  
              Ah,"
"kramer"," Yeah you know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments,            "
"elaine"," Wow!"
"kramer"," It's got an alarm that beeps!"
"elaine"," Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer! I've been wanting to 
              get one of "
"kramer"," Oh no. I got all my appointments up here. "
"elaine"," Where'd you get this?"
"kramer"," The bank, I opened a new account."
"george"," Did you see that whale thing on TV last night?"
"jerry"," No."
"george"," I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were 
              showing how "
"jerry"," It's a mammal."

"george"," But I'm not a marine biologist!"
"jerry"," I'm aware of that."
"george"," So?"

"jerry"," Oh. It's a fascinating field!"
"george"," What if she calls. What will I say?"
"george"," Algae, obviously plankton, I don't know what else I can 
              tell you, Oh"
"elaine"," That is so true! Although one wonders if ""War and 
              Peace"" would has "

"jerry"," Well what happened?"
"kramer"," I have no concentration!"
"jerry"," What, what, what's wrong with you?"
"kramer"," Sand, I can get rid of the sand.  
              Look there"
"jerry"," Hey you're getting it all over the floor!"
"jerry"," Hello....yeah....yes it is....really....oh.

"jerry"," Let me have a look at this thing."

              garbage can."
"jerry"," I would like to know what my name is doin in this creep's 
              organizer "
"jerry"," Who do I even know that would have been in a limousine yesterday            "
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"elaine"," Hey, ""great"" organizer that you gave me."
"kramer"," Oh, you like it huh."

"elaine"," I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. 
              I'm"
"elaine"," What, what is it?"
"kramer"," The sand, it's everywhere!"
"elaine"," OK I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Oh, there you are!"
"elaine"," There you are!"
"jerry"," So?"
"elaine"," So?"
"jerry"," So what do you have to say for yourself?"
"elaine"," So what do you have to say for yourself?"
"jerry"," Why should I have anything for say for myself?"
"elaine"," ""War-- What is it go for?""!"
"jerry"," Ha Ha, who told you?"
"elaine"," Ha ha ha. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!"
"jerry"," You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book ""War-- 
              What "
"elaine"," Ya know what happened?"
"jerry"," Can I take a guess?"
"elaine"," Please."
"jerry"," Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?"
"elaine"," What, how did you know that?"
"jerry"," Because I know who has it. "
"elaine"," What, how did you find it?"
"jerry"," Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found 
              my name in "
"elaine"," Well where is it, give it to me!"
"jerry"," I don't have it!"
"elaine"," Why not."
"jerry"," Because she's not returning it until she gets the money 
              back for the"
"elaine"," But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay 
              for it!"
"jerry"," How much is Testikov getting from Pendman for this book?"
"elaine"," One million."
"jerry"," Well that's a start."
"george"," Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils 
              and took"
"george"," Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things 
              like... "
"jerry"," You know what room Testikov's in?"
"elaine"," Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!"
"jerry"," Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?"
"elaine"," Why are you so interested, you want to take her out?"
"jerry"," You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's 
              trying to"
"elaine"," Well you're not Super Man."
"jerry"," Well you're not Louis Lane."
"elaine"," Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder."
"jerry"," Ya, are you sure you want to do this."
"elaine"," Ya I got to get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up 
              in the "
"jerry"," Ah, here she comes. "
"jerry"," Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne."
"elaine"," Hi, you got the organizer?"
"jerry"," All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes 
              hopefully"
"george"," Oh, they're busting!"
"elaine"," Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya 
              know, single"
"jerry"," Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble 
              and "
"jerry"," Oh! Ramscy&lt;?&gt;, great great book if I my say so sir. 
              I almost read the"
"jerry"," It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!"
"elaine"," Oh, by the way Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day 
              when we "
"elaine"," Well would you believe that it hit actually somebody in 
              the head."
"jerry"," Right in the head!"
"elaine"," Boing!"
"elaine"," Um ,nothing."
"elaine"," Hey that's my purse!"
"elaine"," No that's a radio.."
"elaine"," No I wasn't."
"george"," So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you 
              boys, I "
"elaine"," George I was just reading this thing in the papers, it's 
              amazing!"
"george"," I know I was just telling them the story."
"kramer"," Come on George, finish the story."
"george"," The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man 
              trying to "
"george"," I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great 
              beast"
"jerry"," Mammal."
"george"," Whatever. "
"kramer"," Well, what did you do next?"
"george"," Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed 
              like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down 
              on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!"
"kramer"," What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh."
"jerry"," Well the crowd most have gone wild!"
"george"," Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like 
              Rocky 1. "
"jerry"," Wow! What'd she say?"
"george"," She told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus 
              home."
"jerry"," All right lets go."
"elaine"," Are you in a bad mood?"
"jerry"," No, I just got my laundry back."
"elaine"," Ohhh! GoldenBoy?"
"jerry"," He didn't make it. "
"elaine"," I'm sorry."
"jerry"," This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue."
"kramer"," What's with you?"
"george"," Sand. It's everywhere"
"jerry"," Yeah. Are you full? "
"jerry"," Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. <i></i> Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some. "
"jerry"," You're not gonna have any? "
"jerry"," Do you not like apple pie? "
"jerry"," Well, at least taste it. "
"jerry"," You won't even taste it? "
"jerry"," Come on, try it! <i></i> 
        A little taste! <i></i> Come on! <i></i>
"
"george"," Did she say why? "
"jerry"," No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head 
        like this <i></i> "
"george"," Maybe she's diabetic. "
"jerry"," No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. "
"george"," Maybe you said something that offended her. "
"jerry"," The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those 
        moving walkways all over the city. "
"george"," Like at the airport? <i></i> "
"jerry"," Yeah. "
"george"," That's a great idea!!! "
"jerry"," Tell me about it! "
"george"," We could be zipping all over the place. "
"jerry"," They could at least try it. "
"george"," They never try anything. "
"jerry"," What's the harm? "
"george"," No harm! "
"jerry"," <i></i> I'm sorry. There's no reason 
        for her not to taste that pie. "
"elaine"," Who wouldn't taste a pie? "
"jerry"," Audrey. "
"elaine"," Dump her. "
"jerry"," Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? "
"elaine"," <i></i> I once broke up with someone for not offering 
        me pie. "
"jerry"," You did? "
"elaine"," He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's 
        a sickness. "
"george"," Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there 
        were walkways. <i></i> What are you doing? 
      "
"elaine"," I got a pebble. "
"jerry"," Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman? "
"elaine"," What the hell does that mean? "
"kramer"," Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. <i></i>
"
"elaine"," What? Why? "
"kramer"," Do it. Do it. This. "
"elaine"," Like... <i></i> Like this? "
"kramer"," Oh yeah! It's you! "
"elaine"," What's me? "
"kramer"," <i></i> There's a clothing store downtown. They 
        got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. "
"elaine"," Get out! "
"kramer"," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, 
        dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you 
        on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. "
"george"," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? "
"kramer"," Rinitze. <i></i> Oh yeah... "
"jerry"," <i></i> Uh... may I help you? <i></i> "
"kramer"," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one 
        my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it. "
"george"," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits 
        in there? "
"kramer"," Real Boss! "
"elaine"," I'm going down there. "
"george"," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second 
        interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking 
        me out to lunch on Friday. "
"elaine"," <i></i> Let's go. 
      "
"george"," All right. All right. <i></i> "
"kramer"," <i></i> Are you gonna need this? 
      "
"jerry"," Keep it. <i></i> "
"elaine"," It looks exactly like me. "
"george"," It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. 
        Don't fall asleep Elaine. "
"elaine"," What's going on here? How do you think this happened? "
"george"," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? "
"elaine"," You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? 
      "
"george"," You think so? "
"elaine"," <i></i> Excuse me. Where did this come from? 
      "
"george"," You really think this looks O.K. on me? "
"elaine"," I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? "
"elaine"," <i></i> Well, is there somebody 
        around here I could talk to who would know? "
"elaine"," Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. "
"elaine"," <i></i> Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let 
        me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is 
        me at him about you. "
"elaine"," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous 
        dress? <i></i> Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be 
        caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. <i></i> 
        I'll meet you outside. "
"george"," Pfft! What can you do? <i></i> 
        Is this the price tag? "
"george"," Yes, hello. Party's over. <i></i> "
"george"," So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? "
"george"," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. <i></i> "
"elaine"," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em 
        up. "
"kramer"," How did they get your face? "
"elaine"," I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. <i></i> Jerry? Je... 
        Hello? "
"jerry"," <i></i> Uh... Excuse 
        me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. "
"jerry"," And you waved it away. "
"jerry"," Did you give her a reason? "
"jerry"," You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your 
        head. "
"jerry"," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank 
        you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. <i></i> Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. "
"elaine"," We certainly have. "
"kramer"," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. "
"elaine"," No way! "
"kramer"," Come on, one lap around. "
"elaine"," No. "
"kramer"," It will be a funky adventure. "
"elaine"," Kramer, forget it. "
"kramer"," Jerry, how about you? "
"jerry"," I think you know my policy. "
"kramer"," I'm going home to spatula. <i></i> "
"elaine"," I thought George was meeting us here? "
"jerry"," No he's going downtown to guard the suit. "
"elaine"," He's guarding a suit? "
"kramer"," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. <i></i> Whoa. "
"kramer"," Oh, all right. <i></i> "
"george"," <i></i> What's this? Can't I leave this place for a 
        second? <i></i> Can I help you? "
"george"," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. <i></i> "
"george"," <i></i> No. "
"george"," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. 
        This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. "
"george"," Yes. Now take off those pants. "
"george"," <i></i> You know honey for an unadvertised 
        sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. "
"jerry"," I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts 
        here? "
"jerry"," You've tasted them? "
"jerry"," Oh I see they have apple pie. "
"jerry"," You've had the apple pie? "
"jerry"," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's 
        my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other 
        day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts 
        in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such 
        a thing would prey on my mind. "
"jerry"," <i></i> Why can't I know? "
"jerry"," Hello Poppie. "
"jerry"," The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. <i></i>
"
"jerry"," Huh? "
"jerry"," No, Nothing. "
"kramer"," Hey. These are for you Olive. "
"kramer"," Ohh! "
"jerry"," So she tought I did it to get back at her "
"george"," Why didn't you just tell her? "
"jerry"," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your 
        father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was 
        kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. "
"george"," How could he not have washed? "
"jerry"," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. 
        Turn the water on, do something. "
"george"," Yeah, just like I do. "
"jerry"," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's 
        a cry for help, he wants to get caught. "
"george"," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other 
        thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti? "
"jerry"," We haven't spoken. "
"kramer"," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. <i></i> "
"george"," Olive? "
"kramer"," Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the 
        way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. 
        The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all 
        where anything can happen. "
"george"," I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty 
        minutes. "
"kramer"," Is that Elaine mannequin still there? "
"george"," Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked. "
"jerry"," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... "
"george"," <i></i> Well, 
        look at this. <i></i> This doesn't belong here! Someone has 
        made a terrible mistake. "
"george"," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, 
        I do believe I shall purchase it. "
"george"," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. "
"elaine"," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. 
        You know, possible suspects. "
"jerry"," Yeah, all right. Go ahead. <i></i> "
"elaine"," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face 
        for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost 
        put his finger up my nose. "
"jerry"," Hum... ok, what else you got? "
"elaine"," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. "
"jerry"," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? "
"elaine"," Because you have an attitude. "
"jerry"," Georgio! Nice duds! "
"george"," You're telling me. <i></i> So, what do you think? "
"jerry"," Did you hear something? "
"elaine"," Yeah, like a swoosh. "
"jerry"," Yeah. "
"elaine"," It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you 
        walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. "
"george"," I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street 
        noise. <i></i> This is no good! I got to meet these guys from 
        MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! "
"jerry"," So what? What would they care? "
"george"," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired 
        the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. "
"jerry"," So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make 
        a noise? "
"george"," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice 
        quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's 
        gonna hire? "
"jerry"," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. "
"kramer"," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. "
"jerry"," Audrey? "
"kramer"," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. "
"jerry"," Was it apple? "
"kramer"," What else? "
"jerry"," This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! "
"elaine"," Hmm... No you don't. "
"elaine"," The mannequin! "
"jerry"," Oh, I got to see this thing. "
"jerry"," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. "
"elaine"," You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in 
        your window! "
"elaine"," No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. 
        <i></i> Yes, this is my attorney. "
"jerry"," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, 
      "
"elaine"," Uh-huh "
"jerry"," The Charlie Macarthy hearings. "
"elaine"," Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? "
"elaine"," Jerry get the car. <i></i> "
"jerry"," What are you doing? "
"elaine"," Just get the car! "
"jerry"," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. "
"jerry"," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint 
        gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right? "
"elaine"," Where are you going? "
"jerry"," Poppie's "
"george"," No, I didn't hear anything. "
"george"," No, can't say as I did. "
"george"," Could be the leaves... "
"jerry"," Hello. "
"jerry"," So how was the pie? "
"jerry"," The apple pie you had today at Monks "
"jerry"," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. "
"jerry"," Oh, about the... uh <i></i> "
"jerry"," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. "
"george"," I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. "
"george"," No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. "
"george"," Oh... <i></i> "
"jerry"," So you didn't get the job. "
"george"," No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently 
        ill. "
"jerry"," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have 
        to say something. "
"kramer"," What am I supposed to say? "
"jerry"," Tell her you lost your itch. "
"george"," What happened to your itch? "
"kramer"," I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt 
        her feelings. "
"jerry"," Well you should tell her. "
"kramer"," I'll let her down easy. All right. <i></i> Well, hi Olive. <i></i> No, 
        no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you. "
"kramer"," Uh, well, there's someone else. "
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, yeah... "
"kramer"," Her. <i></i>
"
"kramer"," Yeah, there she is. That's my gal. "
"kramer"," Now Olive, look, I'm sorry. "
"kramer"," Well, it's a style. <i></i> Jerry give me 
        the keys. <i></i> Well, I guess we're 
        gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that. "
"george"," Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? "
"jerry"," No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie 
        away for a long long time. "
"elaine"," You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from 
        a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin 
        that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming 
        from? "
"kramer"," It was there!"
"elaine"," Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so..."
"kramer"," Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so 
        the book itself becomes a coffee table?"
"jerry"," Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you 
        think this is funny - &lt;reads comedy he's written&gt; ""Men definitely 
        hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only 
        care <i>what else</i> is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before 
        they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."""
"jerry"," You don't know? Come on, that's gold!"
"elaine"," Well, I don't know about ""gold."""
"jerry"," Oh, that's gold, baby."
"elaine"," 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?"
"jerry"," I was saying 'baby' way before George!"
"elaine"," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, 
        Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me."
"jerry"," Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night."
"elaine"," Yeah, who's he?"
"jerry"," He's a writer from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. I would like to 
        have a good show."
"kramer"," Danke schoen, my little dumplings."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine"," Yeah, how about her?"
"kramer"," Ooh, she's a package full of energy!"
"elaine"," Yeah, she's a package full of something."
"kramer"," And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - 
        she's brimmin' with positivity!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Great, I'm gonna bring Toby."
"jerry"," Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's 
        gonna be there."
"kramer"," Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?"
"elaine"," Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. &lt;imitates Toby&gt; 
        Really, really great!"
"kramer"," Is that the waitress from the comedy club?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?"
"kramer"," She's got a kid?"
"jerry"," Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!"
"george"," Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat 
        that! That's not food! &lt;to Robin&gt; He's suckin' down Equal packets!"
"george"," 25 kids for his birthday party? &lt;to kid under table&gt; Don't 
        put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, 
        here, have some more sugar packets."
"george"," How about Bozo?"
"george"," Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a 
        kid, Bozo the Clown was <i>the</i> clown, bar none. "
"george"," With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles..."
"george"," And the TV show! He had cartoons!"
"george"," You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday 
        parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday 
        party..."
"george"," Nah, I have asthma. &lt;Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under 
        the table, and George struggles.&gt;"
"elaine"," Fine... &lt;Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.&gt; How 
        are you?"
"elaine"," Nope."
"elaine"," Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior 
        editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?"
"elaine"," Really!"
"elaine"," Oh...well..."
"elaine"," No, really."
"elaine"," I mean, stranger things have happened..."
"elaine"," Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby."
"jerry"," Hey, Ronnie. &lt;To bartender&gt; Can I have a club soda? &lt;To 
        Ronnie&gt; Goin' on tonight?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Yeah, I know."
"jerry"," I don't...think so."
"jerry"," I don't...I dunno."
"jerry"," Oh, is this a bit?"
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry."
"jerry"," Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf 
        now, too."
"jerry"," Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear."
"kramer"," What about me?"
"jerry"," Good, good."
"jerry"," Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?"
"kramer"," Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," O.k., good, I'll see you later. &lt;Kramer and Toby are about 
        to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.&gt;"
"jerry"," Men definitely hit the remote button more than women..."
"jerry"," Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care <i>what 
        else</i> is on TV."
"jerry"," ...that's why men hunt and women nest."
"jerry"," Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down 
        here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!"
"kramer"," Look, she didn't mean anything."
"jerry"," Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!"
"kramer"," She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!"
"jerry"," Hey! What is wrong with you?!"
"jerry"," You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout 
        the whole set!"
"jerry"," No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the 
        show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!"
"jerry"," Oh, I can take it."
"george"," Bozo? "
"george"," B-O-Z-O? "
"george"," You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?"
"george"," How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?"
"george"," How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?"
"george"," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?"
"george"," Yes, he's a clown!"
"george"," Alright, just forget it."
"george"," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, 
        Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?"
"george"," Well, I do what I can. &lt;Robin comes over.&gt;"
"george"," Ah, great, great. &lt;sniffs&gt; What's that smell? Smoke? &lt;walks 
        to the kitchen&gt; Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...&lt;smoke 
        boils into the doorway.&gt; FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!"
"george"," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is 
        lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should 
        all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where 
        heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?"
"george"," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand 
        how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like 
        knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to 
        the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving 
        anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that 
        exit was clear. Any other questions?"
"george"," Its not easy."
"george"," So she doesn't want to see me anymore."
"jerry"," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?"
"george"," No, her too. And her mother."
"jerry"," Really? Her mother."
"george"," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know."
"jerry"," You probably couldn't see because of the smoke."
"george"," Yeah. But it was somebody's arm."
"jerry"," So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day 
        and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion."
"george"," To some degree."
"jerry"," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves."
"george"," In a manner of speaking."
"jerry"," Well, it's honest."
"george"," Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like 
        equals."
"jerry"," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll 
        see things differently."
"george"," Perhaps."
"jerry"," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?"
"george"," Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe."
"jerry"," By the way, did you see this? &lt;Hands George a magazine&gt;"
"george"," What's that?"
"jerry"," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig 
        in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article."
"george"," Wow, he really does a number on you. &lt;reads&gt; ""Seinfeld 
        froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."""
"jerry"," I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer."
"george"," You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and 
        heckle her. "
"jerry"," Yeah, right."
"george"," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like 
        it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'"
"jerry"," Yeah, that'd be something."
"george"," I'm not kidding, you should do it."
"jerry"," But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always 
        had a fantasy about doing that."
"george"," Well, go ahead! Do it!"
"jerry"," Why can't I?"
"george"," No reason!"
"jerry"," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where 
        I work, I'll go down to where she works!"
"george"," This is unprecedented!"
"jerry"," There's no precedent, baby!"
"george"," What...are you using my babies now?"
"jerry"," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice 
        to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to 
        the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, 
        let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'"
"jerry"," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?"
"jerry"," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this 
        business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!"
"kramer"," Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!"
"kramer"," What did you go up there to heckle her for?"
"jerry"," Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste 
        of her own medicine! &lt;George enters.&gt;"
"kramer"," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright."
"jerry"," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident."
"george"," What accident?"
"kramer"," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of 
        the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky 
        toe."
"george"," That's unbelievable!"
"kramer"," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put 
        it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital."
"george"," You ran?"
"kramer"," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe 
        here, buddy - step on it."""
"george"," Holy cow!"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, 
        I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the 
        seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think 
        you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize 
        for ya, buddy - "" &lt;Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive 
        uppercut&gt; - knocked him out cold!"
"george"," How could you do that?!"
"kramer"," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed 
        out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him 
        by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and 
        now I'm drivin' the bus."
"george"," You're Batman."
"kramer"," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he 
        starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' 
        the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and 
        I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop."
"jerry"," You kept makin' all the stops?"
"kramer"," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!"
"george"," Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?"
"kramer"," Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place 
        at the end of the line."
"george"," You did all this...for a pinky toe?"
"kramer"," Well, it's a valuable appendage."
"elaine"," Really."
"jerry"," <i>She</i> got the promotion?"
"jerry"," Why?"
"elaine"," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because 
        Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings."
"jerry"," Too bad."
"elaine"," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! 
        It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to 
        cut. What do we need it for?"
"jerry"," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the 
        home.'"
"elaine"," Why don't you just shut the f-"
"elaine"," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??"
"kramer"," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order 
        of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon 
        as possible."
"elaine"," Oh, wonderful!"
"kramer"," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile 
        on her face."
"elaine"," Oh, of course! She's deranged."
"jerry"," So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and 
        see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to 
        write another article."
"jerry"," Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!"
"jerry"," Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, won't be long."
"jerry"," Gotta go. &lt;heads out on stage&gt;"
"george"," Robin? Robin!"
"george"," Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer 
        has opened my eyes. I think I've changed. "
"george"," O.k....&lt;is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.&gt;"
"jerry"," I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need ""the clown"" 
        in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse 
        him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo..."
"george"," ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give 
        me one more chance. "
"george"," Alright, but I'm serious about this."
"jerry"," ...that's why men hunt and women nest."
"george"," The prop comic? &lt;Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.&gt; 
        Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?"
"jerry"," George - could I have a word?"
"kramer"," All right, get off at the next exit."
"jerry"," Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the 
              exit."
"kramer"," It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there."
"jerry","  You sure we're makin' the right move?"
"elaine"," We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a 
              weekend in"
"jerry"," Didn't they just have a baby?"
"elaine"," That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see 
              the"
"jerry"," Is it possible they're just having babies to get people 
              to visit"
"kramer"," Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," Put that on the top of your list."
"jerry"," No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and 
              Jane"
"elaine"," Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex 
              yet, but"
"jerry"," I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she 
              signed a"
"elaine"," When's Rachel comin' out?"
"jerry"," She's makin' the three o'clock train."
"elaine"," Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting 
              you"
"jerry"," I bought him some kishka."
"kramer"," What's that?"
"jerry"," It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry 
              it. In"
"george"," I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love."
"george"," You see? We were made for each other.  
              It's"
"george"," Pertussin. Ever try it with club soda?"
"george"," Oh, very refreshing.  Sex is like joining 
              a"
"george"," Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at 
              a"
"george"," My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton 
              tomatoes."
"kramer"," Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back."
"jerry"," Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
"kramer"," Come on, I'll rub some on yours."
"jerry"," No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No."
"george","  You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar 
              and"
"george"," Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You 
              wanna go"
"george"," 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?"
"jerry"," No thanks."
"kramer"," No. "
"jerry"," And then there's Maude. "
"elaine"," Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?"
"jerry"," No lines."
"elaine"," You know why? One word shade."
"jerry"," So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous 
              event?"
"elaine"," I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something."
"kramer"," I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, 
              you"
"elaine","  No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends."
"jerry","  Oh this is interesting."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Jane's topless. "
"kramer"," Yo yo ma."
"jerry"," Boutros Boutros-Ghali."
"elaine"," Nice rack. "
"jerry"," Oh, in a minute, Carol."
"kramer"," We're gonna be right there."
"jerry"," This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet."
"elaine"," Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?"
"kramer"," Maybe she's trying to create a buzz."
"elaine"," What?"
"kramer"," You know, get some good word of mouth goin'."
"jerry"," Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as 
              Jane"
"jerry"," No thanks."
"elaine"," I'm good."
"kramer"," Deh-deh-deh-deh-  All right, show's over. I'm 
              goin'"
"elaine"," Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby."
"elaine"," Ugghh."
"elaine"," Oh, gorgeous, yes."
"jerry"," So very gorgeous."
"jerry"," Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?"
"elaine"," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
"jerry"," Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. "
"elaine"," Oh, you have to lie."
"jerry"," It's a must lie situation."
"elaine"," Yes, it's a must lie situation."
"jerry"," You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane 
              topless."
"elaine"," No, I don't think so."
"jerry"," You know, we might want to tell Kramer."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine","  Pretty gorgeous."
"elaine"," Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't 
              wait to"
"elaine"," Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?"
"jerry"," Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station."
"elaine"," Yeah, see ya."
"jerry"," Okay. "
"jerry"," Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes"
"george"," Hey Rachel!"
"george"," What kind of a greeting was that?"
"jerry"," She's got greeting problems."
"george"," Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em 
              like"
"jerry"," Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup"
"kramer"," Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!"
"george"," Hey! Wow, the K-Man! "
"jerry"," You got lobster for everybody?"
"kramer"," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
"george"," This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster 
              for"
"kramer"," I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows 
              that"
"george"," You saw who, what?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her."
"jerry","  All right."
"george"," You saw Jane topless?"
"jerry"," Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless."
"george"," Oh you mean face down on her chest."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," Face up on her back?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Well why'd she do that?"
"kramer"," I guess she was hot."
"george"," You mean she just laid there topless?"
"kramer"," No, no, she got up, walked around..."
"george"," Walked around? And you looked?"
"kramer"," Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm 
              gonna go"
"george"," I can't believe it, you saw her before me."
"jerry"," Think of me as a doctor. "
"george"," Well, how good a look did you get?"
"jerry"," Well what'd you mean?"
"george"," Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her 
              to a police"
"jerry"," They'd pick her up in about ten minutes."
"george"," Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize 
              her"
"jerry"," I guess that's true..."
"george"," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't 
              like"
"jerry"," What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?"
"george"," Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime."
"jerry"," You can see me naked. I can offer you that."
"george"," It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of 
              Tang and"
"elaine"," Nobody ever called me breathtaking before."
"jerry"," I've never been called breathtaking either."
"elaine"," I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then 
              who's not"
"jerry"," Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room."
"elaine"," Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out."
"jerry"," How are you gonna do that?"
"elaine"," I can be very clever."
"elaine"," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and 
              sees"
"george"," Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their 
              room"
"george"," Oh, sorry."
"george"," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've 
              never"
"jerry"," You might have."
"george"," I didn't."
"jerry"," You won't."
"jerry"," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what 
              you"
"george"," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
"jerry"," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some 
              gum."
"george"," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms 
              me up."
"george"," Okay.  Thanks anyway. "
"jerry"," Wait'll you get to know him."
"jerry"," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything 
              quite so"
"george"," I was in the pool! I was in the pool!"
"george"," Did she do it on purpose?"
"jerry"," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door."
"george"," I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me."
"jerry"," So what?"
"george"," Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But..."
"jerry"," But..."
"george"," Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the 
              water was"
"jerry"," Oh... You mean... shrinkage."
"george"," Yes. Significant shrinkage!"
"jerry"," So you feel you were short changed."
"george"," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete"
"jerry"," Well, so what's the difference?"
"george"," What if she discusses it with Jane?"
"jerry"," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane."
"george"," How do you know?"
"jerry"," Women aren't like us."
"george"," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about"
"jerry"," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, 
              I think"
"george"," How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking 
              down"
"elaine"," What do you mean, like laundry?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards..."
"elaine"," It shrinks?"
"jerry"," Like a frightened turtle!"
"elaine"," Why does it shrink?"
"george"," It just does."
"elaine"," I don't know how you guys walk around with those things."
"kramer"," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?"
"kramer"," You mean you've never tasted lobster?"
"kramer"," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when 
              you"
"jerry"," No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable."
"elaine"," Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun 
              over here."
"jerry"," Yeah, the lobster'll scare him."
"george"," See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to 
              be much"
"elaine"," Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in 
              Jane's"
"george"," What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're 
              you"
"george"," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking"
"jerry","  Easy big fella."
"kramer"," No, I got 'em in the ocean."
"kramer"," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all 
              these"
"kramer"," Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for"
"kramer"," Ahhh! "
"elaine"," Some night, huh?"
"elaine"," Some dinner, huh?"
"elaine"," Some house, huh?"
"elaine"," Some ugly baby, huh?"
"elaine"," I said, uh, some snuggly baby."
"elaine"," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised 
              to hear"
"jerry"," You told her?"
"jerry"," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
"george"," You're going back to New York now?"
"george"," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend 
              Rachel,"
"george"," And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?"
"george"," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is 
              not all"
"george"," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
"kramer"," Looking for this? "
"kramer"," Well, I thought you might wind up around here."
"kramer"," I'm afraid I couldn't do that."
"kramer"," Well, that wouldn't be kosher."
"kramer"," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch."
"kramer"," Heyahhh!"
"jerry"," Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle 
              of the"
"elaine"," George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted."
"kramer"," I didn't know you could cook."
"george"," Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious 
              host."
"kramer"," You'd regret it for the rest of your life."
"jerry","  Hey, look at this guy."
"george"," A little breakfast."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george","  And, uh, you eat eggs, right?"
"jerry"," Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs 
              like"
"george"," Ah, enjoying them?"
"george"," Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with 
              one of"
"george"," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
"jerry"," Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
"elaine"," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. 
              (Policeman"
"kramer"," Wonder what's goin' on."
"george"," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
"george"," I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael 
              to town."
"elaine"," Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back 
              in the same"
"jerry"," I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer."
"elaine"," How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?"
"jerry"," They got some sort of program."
"george"," Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some 
              more."
"jerry"," Hey, isn't that Michael's car?"
"elaine"," There's Rachel."
"george"," Where? "
"jerry"," Bad."
"george"," O.K., Danny, take a swing. &lt;Tartabull swings the bat.&gt; 
        N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder."
"george"," No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to 
        hear myself talk. Yes, really!"
"george"," What are all sweatin' for?"
"george"," Hot? &lt;Feels Tartabull's material.&gt; What is this?"
"george"," This uniform, what's it made from?"
"george"," No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. &lt;Tries to look at 
        the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.&gt; Will 
        you stop it? &lt;Looks at the tag.&gt; Oh. Of course. Polyester! "
"george"," I can't believe you're not playing in cotton."
"george"," You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?"
"george"," Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck."
"george"," Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. 
        &lt;George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something 
        in his back.&gt;"
"elaine"," Oh, you want one?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," I'll get it. &lt;Reaches in her bag for money.&gt;"
"jerry"," That's alright, I got it."
"elaine"," Jerry!"
"jerry"," Elaine, stop it."
"elaine"," Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got 
        any money.  Yo! Dogs! Two!"
"jerry"," I'm sorry."
"elaine"," Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. 
        Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis. "
"jerry"," Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?"
"elaine"," Yeah, she was an editor."
"jerry"," Right, just like you. "
"elaine"," Yeah. Can you hold my seat? &lt;Elaine gets up.&gt;"
"jerry"," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any 
        taller. So you're Miss, uh..."
"jerry"," I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. 
        &lt;Miss Rhode Island laughs.&gt;"
"george"," Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?"
"jerry"," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel."
"george"," You're incredible."
"jerry"," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and 
        she's going to be down there for the pageant."
"george"," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, 
        Jerry!"
"jerry"," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone."
"george"," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?"
"jerry"," No, it's part of the contest rules."
"george"," What does the chaperone do?"
"jerry"," I don't know, she just sits there."
"george"," Can she talk?"
"jerry"," I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. &lt;Picks up the phone 
        and dials.&gt;"
"george"," You're calling her?"
"jerry"," Yeah.  There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen 
        Hanson?"
"george"," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?"
"jerry"," Of course, they're polyester."
"george"," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those 
        things get? They should be wearing cotton."
"jerry"," Why <i>do</i> they wear polyester?"
"george"," I don't know. That's all gonna change."
"jerry"," You're going to do something about it?"
"george"," Why shouldn't I?"
"elaine"," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have 
        a little grace...not as much as Jackie - "
"elaine"," O.K., fine, I have...no grace."
"elaine"," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, right."
"elaine"," Justin Pitt?"
"elaine"," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce."
"elaine"," Nothing. &lt;Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.&gt;"
"elaine"," I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis..."
"jerry"," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. 
        You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. 
        They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene 
        yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together 
        later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone.  The chaperone 
        can't make it.  Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're 
        not going? &lt;Kramer enters.&gt; Hold on one second.  Hey, 
        what are you doing tonight?"
"kramer"," Nothin.'"
"jerry"," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna 
        go?"
"kramer"," What state?"
"jerry"," Rhode Island."
"kramer"," They're never in contention."
"george"," How do you know?"
"kramer"," Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six. 
      "
"jerry"," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner."
"kramer"," Giddy-up!"
"elaine"," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes."
"elaine"," Grace?"
"elaine"," You think <i>I</i> have grace?"
"elaine"," Just some?"
"george"," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?"
"george"," How's everything going? Everything O.K.?"
"george"," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about 
        the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of 
        the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some 
        of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms."
"george"," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not 
        a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton."
"george"," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing 
        games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't 
        you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're 
        happier - they're gonna play better."
"george"," Oh - I've got something."
"jerry"," Congratulations!"
"elaine"," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing."
"jerry"," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?"
"elaine"," I attend to his personal affairs. "
"jerry"," Like what?"
"elaine"," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy 
        him some socks."
"jerry"," Really! Socks!"
"elaine"," Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers."
"jerry"," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! &lt;Kramer enters.&gt;"
"jerry"," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got 
        something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you 
        know what I mean."
"kramer"," No way!"
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing 
        while you defile this woman, you're crazy."
"jerry"," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!"
"kramer"," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, 
        Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's 
        dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery 
        of everything the pageant stands for. "
"jerry"," But - "
"jerry"," But wait a minute..."
"kramer"," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun 
        with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for 
        something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! &lt;Jerry tries 
        to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an 
        inch.&gt;"
"kramer"," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world 
        a better place?"
"jerry"," That's a hell of a plan.  Listen - "
"jerry"," Alright, Kramer!"
"kramer"," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these 
        questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions 
        of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, 
        poise counts."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won 
        easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
"kramer"," Tape her breasts together. &lt;Jerry is shocked.&gt;"
"kramer"," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but 
        you got a big waist."
"jerry"," Hey, come on!"
"kramer"," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. "
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. Just - <i>thip!</i> - suck you in."
"jerry"," I'll be right back. &lt;Leaves the table.&gt;"
"kramer"," So, what's your talent?"
"kramer"," Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten."
"kramer"," No, five. But you were close. "
"kramer"," How's your evening?"
"kramer"," Stop right there."
"kramer"," Disaster. "
"kramer"," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress."
"jerry"," Well, here we are..."
"kramer"," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we 
        don't play at all."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell."
"kramer"," Oh, come on."
"jerry"," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!"
"kramer"," Oh, you're poo-pooing!"
"jerry"," Yes, I poo-poo."
"kramer"," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. 
        To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!"
"jerry"," I don't want to stop her!"
"kramer"," You <i>can't</i> stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and 
        go, but this kid has got something! &lt;Turns to leave.&gt;"
"jerry"," Yeah, so do you. &lt;George enters with a newspaper.&gt;"
"george"," Well, did you see it?"
"jerry"," See what?"
"george"," The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! 
         ""Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can 
        breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed 
        anything could be so soft and fluffy.' """
"jerry"," Boy, they really do sound comfortable."
"jerry"," I'm working in Atlantic City."
"george"," Really!"
"jerry"," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come 
        down?"
"george"," Atlantic City?  Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. 
        I'm in. I'm down."
"jerry"," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. &lt;Picks 
        up the phone.&gt; She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number..."
"elaine"," So, what do you think?"
"elaine"," You don't like them?"
"elaine"," What's wrong?"
"elaine"," Too tight?"
"elaine"," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. &lt;The phone rings.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?"
"elaine"," Sorry. Hello?"
"jerry"," Hey Elaine, it's me."
"elaine"," Jerry?"
"jerry"," We're going to Atlantic City."
"elaine"," Really? When?"
"jerry"," Today, right now! Are you in?"
"elaine"," One second, hang on.  Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would 
        it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?"
"elaine"," Yes."
"elaine"," Well, it's just one more day. "
"jerry"," Why not?"
"elaine"," Because I have to return the socks and get different ones."
"elaine"," I gotta go. &lt;Hangs up.&gt;"
"kramer"," No. Alright, watch me now. &lt;Karen sits on the bed. Kramer 
        walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile 
        on his face.&gt; Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? 
        Posture."
"kramer"," Let's try a few more questions, alright? &lt;Karen stands up.&gt; 
        If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, 
        and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep 
        with the enemy's leader, what would you do?"
"kramer"," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you 
        can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a 
        thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
"george"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Hey."
"george"," How was the show?"
"jerry"," Good. How was the roulette?"
"george"," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here."
"jerry"," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!"
"elaine"," But what??"
"elaine"," But that's why I got you the tighter ones! &lt;Holds them up.&gt;"
"elaine"," What do you want!?"
"jerry"," What the hell is that?"
"george"," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!"
"george"," Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?"
"jerry"," Wait a second. &lt;Grabs the icebucket off the counter.&gt; This'll 
        scare 'em off. &lt;Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear 
        a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. 
        Jerry gets back into bed.&gt; Well, good night, Ollie."
"george"," Good night, Stan."
"kramer"," What is it?"
"kramer"," How did this happen?"
"kramer"," Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered."
"kramer"," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!"
"jerry"," What? Why? What happened?"
"kramer"," Her birds are dead."
"jerry"," Birds?"
"kramer"," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic 
        act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? 
        I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that 
        contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who 
        just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! &lt;Kramer 
        turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.&gt;"
"jerry"," What are you looking at? &lt;Kramer goes out onto the terrace 
        and looks down.&gt; Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, 
        because the water was making the room too cold."
"jerry"," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an 
        accident!"
"kramer"," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is 
        a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in 
        our way, you're crazy!"
"jerry"," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! &lt;Kramer 
        exits.&gt;"
"jerry"," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's 
        doves with a bucket of water last night."
"george"," Oh. &lt;Goes back into the bathroom.&gt;"
"kramer"," How ya feelin'?"
"kramer"," There's nothing to be nervous about."
"jerry"," I heard those doves were really incredible. "
"george"," That's a shame. &lt;Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.&gt;"
"jerry"," It's like watching an animal get tortured."
"george"," Hey, hey! Yankee game! &lt;Changes the channel.&gt;"
"jerry"," Oh, great! Alright. &lt;We hear the announcers calling the game.&gt;"
"jerry"," That's a shame."
"kramer"," Poise. Poise!"
"elaine"," Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil."
"elaine"," No, I'm sure you do."
"elaine"," Well, it's for my boss."
"elaine"," Elaine."
"elaine"," It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha"
"elaine"," Uh, aw, KL5-239O."
"elaine"," Okay,   Move  along. . . "
"jerry"," Why did you give him MY number?"
"elaine"," I think he's got ideas. "
"jerry"," I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?"
"jerry"," Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?"
"elaine"," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?"
"jerry"," Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's 
        here."
"george"," Hey, hey."
"elaine"," Hey hey"
"jerry"," Hi Julie."
"george"," Elaine, Julie."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine"," Oh, mine's ""Ike""."
"george"," Hey, wanna get some lunch?"
"jerry"," Just had a big bowl of Kix."
"george"," Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?"
"elaine"," Ah, no."
"elaine"," No, no. How about if you bring me back something?"
"george"," Sure, all right, what do you want?"
"elaine"," Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad? "
"george"," What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop."
"elaine"," They have big salads."
"george"," I've never seen a big salad."
"elaine"," They have a big salad."
"george"," Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?"
"elaine"," It's okay, you don't"
"george"," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?"
"jerry"," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs."
"george"," , we'll see you in a little while."
"elaine"," Maybe I should just get married."
"jerry"," Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?"
"elaine"," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell."
"jerry"," People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public."
"elaine"," You can say that again."
"jerry"," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm 
        going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house."
"elaine"," Good for you."
"jerry"," I don't need a bunch of people staring at us."
"elaine"," Right on baby. "
"jerry"," What was that?"
"kramer"," That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again."
"elaine"," Who Gendason?"
"kramer"," Steve Gendason."
"elaine"," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?"
"kramer"," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played 
        with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's 
        beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second 
        shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
"elaine"," So what?"
"kramer"," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean 
        the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that. 
      "
"jerry"," Certainly are. "
"kramer"," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. "
"kramer"," He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like 
        a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . "
"jerry"," All right. You're in MY face."
"elaine"," I still don't see what the big deal is. "
"kramer"," A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos. 
      "
"george"," Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha "
"george"," He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic."
"george"," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the 
        Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. 
        You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" 
        it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All 
        right.  All right. I "
"george"," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference 
        does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless. "
"jerry","  Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll 
        tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED 
        your pencil. "
"elaine"," I told ya'. He has ideas."
"jerry"," He doesn't even care if a man answers."
"elaine"," Or you."
"george"," Hey, hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"elaine"," No problem."
"elaine"," Thank you, Julie."
"george"," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim."
"george"," Ya, you go. "
"jerry"," Bye bye"
"george"," Did you see what just happened?"
"jerry"," Well, that all depends. . . "
"george"," Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?"
"jerry"," Yeah, so?"
"george"," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad. "
"jerry"," Is that a fact?"
"george"," Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right."
"jerry"," No it isn't. "
"george"," I mean I'm the one who bought it. "
"jerry"," Yes you did."
"george"," You think she should have said something?"
"jerry"," She could have."
"george"," Oh, I know."
"jerry"," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. "
"george"," You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        they knew it. "
"jerry"," Obviously."
"kramer"," Turn on the TV."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," I'm puttin it on"
"kramer"," Jerry . . . <br/>
        Jerry Well, it has nothing to do with you."
"kramer"," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he 
        murdered the dry cleaner."
"jerry"," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to 
        murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that. "
"elaine"," I like Julie. She's very personable."
"george"," Yeah, she's very lovely."
"elaine"," That's great George. "
"george"," So did you enjoy your lunch?"
"elaine"," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha 
        ha Wht?"
"george"," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed 
        you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, 
        . . . "
"elaine"," Even though what?"
"george"," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's 
        the difference?"
"elaine"," What? What are you trying to say, George?"
"george"," It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. 
        She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. "
"elaine"," You want the money for the big salad, George?"
"george"," No, no,"
"elaine"," What is the problem?"
"george"," There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby 
        you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing 
        the big salad."
"jerry"," And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it."
"jerry"," Ah, no , I don't think so."
"jerry"," We don't need a bunch of people staring at us."
"jerry"," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know 
        what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, 
        that's a long story. "
"jerry"," Hello Newman."
"jerry"," No, no I don't. Why?"
"jerry"," I suppose."
"jerry"," I don't know. Nothing.? "
"jerry"," You two know each other?"
"newman"," You might say that."
"newman"," Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye 
        Jerry. Have fun. Hehe "
"jerry"," . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?"
"jerry"," Why?"
"jerry"," You liked, Newman?"
"jerry"," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop 
        seeing him. "
"jerry"," . . . HE ended it? "
"jerry"," No, no of course not. "
"kramer"," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. "
"jerry"," What tee?"
"kramer"," A golf tee. In the dry cleaner."
"jerry"," Newman! She went out with Newman!"
"elaine"," It must be a mistake."
"jerry"," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that 
        she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? 
        He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. 
        Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did 
        see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing 
        her? "
"elaine"," Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. "
"jerry"," No, there's less. "
"elaine"," It's possible."
"jerry"," No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil. "
"elaine"," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. "
"jerry"," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie."
"jerry"," No,, but thank you. "
"jerry"," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got 
        your pencil. "
"elaine"," Ugh! You are kidding me. "
"jerry"," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor 
        and got it. "
"elaine"," I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. "
"jerry"," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it."
"elaine"," To please Mr. Pitt. "
"jerry"," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited. 
      "
"elaine"," Uh, great!"
"jerry"," Hi Julie."
"jerry"," Hi. "
"elaine"," Hi Julie."
"jerry"," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. "
"elaine"," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me 
        buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. "
"jerry"," How do you know THAT?"
"newman"," Who is it."
"jerry"," It's Jerry."
"newman"," You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?"
"jerry"," Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!"
"newman"," Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the 
        east wing?"
"jerry"," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?"
"newman"," There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?"
"jerry"," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little 
        rat's nest. Now, what happened?"
"newman"," Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what 
        Happened. She wasn't my type. "
"jerry"," Noit your type? "
"newman"," Not really. "
"jerry"," Well, how come? "
"newman"," Ah, she just didn't do it for me. "
"jerry"," What, what is wrong with her? "
"newman"," Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters."
"jerry"," You don't think she's attractive?"
"newman"," No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me. "
"jerry"," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. "
"newman"," Care for some lemonade? "
"jerry"," No, thank you. "
"newman"," Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha "
"kramer"," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the 
        play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of 
        one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry."
"jerry"," But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?"
"kramer"," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing 
        up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well 
        I don't have to tell you what happened. "
"jerry"," What are you so worried about this for?"
"kramer"," You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? "
"jerry"," He did?"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and 
        they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus 
        denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. "
"jerry"," So it had nothing to do with you. "
"kramer"," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. "
"jerry"," No, I don't think so. "
"kramer"," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus."
"jerry"," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think 
        Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I 
        like that. "
"jerry"," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?"
"kramer"," Oh, I love curls."
"jerry"," Yeah,, me too. "
"kramer"," All right, I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Where you going?"
"kramer"," Genderson's."
"jerry"," You're going to see Genderson?"
"kramer"," It's weighing on my conscience. "
"george"," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were 
        dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender 
        thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?"
"george"," A ha! We're just friends. "
"george"," Oh, share."
"george"," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that. "
"george"," Well, she probably just assumed. "
"george"," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went 
        out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, 
        that it came from me? "
"george"," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
        IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY 
        FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?"
"elaine"," It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil 
        right away."
"elaine"," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry. "
"elaine"," Really? A fight with the foreman? "
"elaine"," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. "
"elaine"," Okay. "
"jerry"," You had how many dates with him? Three? "
"jerry"," And . . "
"jerry"," What? I'm not looking. Nothing. "
"jerry"," Why are you looking at my face? "
"jerry"," Where am I going to look? "
"jerry"," . . . I can't. "
"jerry"," Newman!"
"jerry"," All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman 
        found this unacceptable. "
"elaine"," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy. "
"jerry"," You're going out with the stationery store guy?"
"elaine"," I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no. "
"elaine"," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You 
        had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought 
        you the big salad. Didn't ya'. "
"elaine"," Uh, uh."
"george"," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. 
        But you had to have the BIG SALAD. "
"jerry"," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get 
        out of here.  Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for 
        Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey 
        Turnpike. "
"kramer"," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to 
        see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back 
        off. "
"kramer"," My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! "
"kramer"," I thought we would blend in."
"kramer"," we would have had all that bridge traffic. "
"jerry"," how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!"
"jerry"," I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre 
        toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with 
        all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, 
        by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta 
        pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that 
        you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and 
        this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money 
        down the toilet, but look how close I am!"""
"jerry"," I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast 
        at Tiffany's"" thing."
"george"," I think she finds my stupidity charming."
"jerry"," As we all do."
"george"," Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll 
        swing by after."
"jerry"," Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?"
"george"," Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll 
        love me."
"jerry"," You're good with the mothers."
"george"," Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters."
"jerry"," Maybe you should date the mothers."
"george"," Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, 
        then I'd really have something goin'."
"jerry"," Oh, you got something goin'."
"george"," Yeah."
"kramer","  Hey."
"george"," Hey! "
"kramer"," Hey, you got a hammer?"
"jerry"," What do you need a hammer for?"
"kramer"," Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em."
"jerry"," Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over."
"kramer"," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. 
        Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, 
        you wanna take a ride?"
"jerry"," Nah, I don't think so."
"kramer","  George, you wanna go for a ride?"
"george","  Nah."
"kramer"," Oh, COME ON!"
"jerry"," Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?"
"kramer"," All right, I've had it with you two. "
"jerry"," Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other 
        day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?"
"kramer"," A gymnast!"
"jerry"," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics."
"kramer"," A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll 
        melt your face."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing."
"kramer","  ""Bailing""?"
"jerry"," Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just 
        a sexual dalliance."
"kramer"," Jerry, you should pay that price."
"jerry"," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?"
"kramer"," Ch- oo-... what?"
"george","  A gymnast! I can't 
        believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast."
"jerry","  What is this?"
"george"," What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on."
"jerry","  ""Back on""? What was 
        it doing off?"
"george"," I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office""."
"jerry","  What for?"
"george"," Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances."
"jerry"," Unbuttoned, or all the way off?"
"george"," ALL the way, baby!"
"jerry"," Of course."
"kramer","  Yeow! Whoa."
"jerry"," What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should 
        see the doctor and have it checked out."
"kramer","  Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
"jerry","  You always take the shirt 
        off?"
"george"," Always."
"jerry"," Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. 
        I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared."
"elaine"," What meeting?"
"elaine"," Oh! "
"elaine"," Yes?"
"elaine"," All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt."
"kramer"," Elaine?"
"elaine"," Come in, come in!"
"kramer"," Yeah.  Yah, huh?"
"elaine"," Ah, right there, yeah."
"kramer","  Yeah, that's..."
"elaine"," Kramer, it's..."
"kramer","  There she blows! "
"elaine"," Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work 
        to do, okay?"
"kramer"," Oh, these are nice corners, huh?"
"kramer","  Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. 
        BIG computers."
"kramer"," Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through 
        the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...  Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!"
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids..."
"elaine"," Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do."
"kramer"," Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right 
        at you."
"kramer","  Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused.  Waahh! Oh, mama!"
"elaine"," Kramer, what's wrong?"
"kramer"," Mama!"
"elaine"," Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?"
"kramer"," I think I gotta go to the doctor!  Oh, mama!"
"george"," Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most 
        important thing in the world is spending time with family."
"george","  Very close, yes. Almost painfully close."
"george"," Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait!  Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA!  Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's 
        do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?"
"george"," Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?"
"george"," No, I know I don't have to, I want to."
"george"," I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.  Here we go, all right."
"george","  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!"
"elaine","  Look, there's a spaceship! That is 
        so cool!"
"elaine","  Right here."
"elaine"," No, no, unfocus."
"elaine","  Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right 
        down.  Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting."
"elaine"," Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?"
"elaine"," How can I go?"
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea."
"jerry","  So, Ceausescu. He must've 
        been some dictator."
"jerry"," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. 
        ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"""
"jerry"," No, you'd have to be crazy."
"jerry"," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad."
"jerry"," So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. 
        You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, ""What 
        the hell, I'll just eat some trash."""
"george"," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!"
"jerry"," Was it in the trash?"
"george"," Yes."
"jerry"," Then it was trash."
"george"," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top."
"jerry"," But it was in the cylinder!"
"george"," Above the rim."
"jerry"," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse."
"george"," It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on."
"jerry"," Was it eaten?"
"george"," One little bite."
"jerry"," Well, that's garbage."
"george"," But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!"
"jerry"," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and 
        Bum. You are now a Bum."
"jerry"," Hey!"
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," What's with you?"
"kramer"," I got a stone."
"jerry"," What stone?"
"kramer"," A kidney stone."
"jerry"," What is that, anyway?"
"kramer"," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in 
        the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the 
        ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!"
"jerry"," Oh, that's gotta hurt."
"elaine"," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. "
"elaine"," All right.  Hey, you guys--what's the name of the 
        new company gonna be?"
"elaine","  ""Moland""?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything 
        called ""Moland""."
"elaine"," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?"
"george","  No, Lindsay, it was 
        not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. 
        Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I 
        tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage 
        all the time.  It was no big thing. That's right. 
        Oh, okay. Buh-bye.  I'm back in, she gave me a second 
        chance."
"jerry"," Good for you."
"george"," Yes, good for me!"
"jerry"," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it 
        out."
"george"," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!"
"kramer","  Behold! The Games of 
        the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! "
"jerry"," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what 
        they do. It's not going to make any difference."
"kramer"," Jerry, what is your problem?"
"jerry"," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know 
        what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having 
        to consider people's feelings."
"kramer"," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," Tantric yoga?"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual 
        delights that most men dare not dream of!"
"jerry"," Boy, you can really talk some trash.  I guess that's 
        better than eating it."
"kramer"," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? "
"jerry"," All right."
"george"," Did you pass your stone yet?"
"kramer"," Not yet. But the suspense is killing me."
"jerry","  Hey, that's her!"
"kramer"," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.  Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! 
        Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back 
        into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, 
        good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full 
        in, double back, and she sticks the landing!  Perhaps you'd like to keep 
        the tape?  Well, I'll take that as a yes."
"jerry","  Well, here we are."
"jerry"," How did you stay on that beam like that?  I mean, 
        it's only this wide!"
"jerry"," Oh boy..."
"jerry"," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical 
        world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, 
        there was nothing gymnastic about it."
"elaine"," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?"
"jerry"," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno."
"elaine"," No, what?"
"jerry"," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know..."
"elaine"," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk 
        and..."
"jerry"," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of 
        specifics..."
"elaine"," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?"
"jerry"," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like 
        the apparatus."
"kramer"," You mean like the uneven parallel bars?"
"jerry"," See, again, I really don't feel that..."
"elaine"," The balance beam?"
"jerry"," Could we stop?"
"elaine","  Not the pommel horse?"
"jerry"," All right. Let's just drop it."
"jerry"," So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in 
        now because of, you know, last night."
"elaine"," I dunno, at least three weeks."
"jerry","  Oh, great."
"elaine"," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly 
        put the kibosh on the big water merger."
"jerry"," Between Poland and Morgan?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Started a big name controversy."
"jerry"," Kramer! The stone!"
"jerry"," What happened, did you pass the stone?"
"kramer","  No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and 
        I didn't make it."
"george","  
        ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...""  You call this coffee? "
"george"," I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-"
"george"," Oh, sure. Of course.  Um, 
        uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second.  Here you go, now don't worry 
        about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine."
"george"," Look at this sparkle.  Mrs. 
        Enright!  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!"
"george","  No, Lindsay, I had accidentally 
        spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have 
        a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a 
        dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother 
        it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see 
        you later. Buh-bye. "
"jerry"," Strike two!"
"george"," You think I'm going down?"
"jerry"," You're behind in the count."
"george"," I know."
"kramer","  Hey, what are you doing later?"
"jerry"," I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you."
"kramer"," Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first 
        time people are a little shy, a little reticent."
"jerry"," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks."
"kramer"," All right, where you going?"
"jerry"," We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is 
        an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out."
"kramer"," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this 
        girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!"
"kramer"," No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry."
"jerry"," Yeah, well you're going."
"kramer"," Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!"
"elaine"," Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?"
"elaine"," Well, I'm so sorry! I-"
"elaine"," Oh, sorry.  Hello?"
"jerry"," ""Greatest Show on Earth""!"
"jerry"," Well, they certainly take up a lot of space."
"elaine","  Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um 
        hold on.  Mr. Pitt!"
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called 
        an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!"
"elaine","  Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. 
        Lemme just...  Yeah, I've got it...  Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. 
         Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at 
        that poster!"
"elaine","  No, you don't see it, and you're never 
        going to see it!  
        Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. 
        Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!"
"elaine"," In about twenty minutes."
"elaine"," Um, no."
"elaine"," Uh, Mr. Pitt..."
"elaine"," Um, there's a just... "
"elaine"," No?"
"george"," Well, here we are."
"george"," Maybe I could just use the bathroom."
"jerry"," Well, break a leg."
"jerry"," Eh, show biz..."
"jerry"," Boy, those capes are really coming back."
"jerry"," What is that sound?"
"george"," Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, 
        huh? Whew!"
"jerry"," Oh, why not?"
"jerry"," Really?"
"jerry"," Come on. Lets go"
"elaine"," No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis 
              recquet."
"jerry"," What's it doin here?"
"elaine"," He wanted to have it restrung.  Here I need to 
              pick that up"
"elaine"," Oh, Hi."
"elaine"," Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. "
"elaine"," Oh, I'm not very good."
"elaine"," Really? Grace?"
"elaine"," Uh, no. Not really."
"jerry"," Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one."
"elaine"," Newman plays tennis?"
"jerry"," He's fantastic."
"elaine"," Uh, no ... take it."
"elaine"," Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow."
"elaine"," Thanks"
"jerry"," You loaned her Pitt's racquet?"
"jerry"," Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump 
              over the net."
"elaine"," Bye"
"jerry"," Bye bye"
"elaine"," Have you noticed she never laughs"
"jerry"," Hm, really?"
"elaine"," Yeah"
"george"," Check that out "
"kramer"," Whoa, you're dating this woman? "
"george"," That's right."
"kramer"," George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti "
"george"," What's that."
"kramer"," Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal."
"george"," And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. 
            "
"kramer"," Maybe she's bulimic"
"george"," Wa?"
"kramer"," Bulimic, "
"george"," Kramer, she's a model."
"kramer"," Exactly"
"george"," I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right 
              after"
"kramer"," There you go monkey boy."
"george"," Just enjoying watching you."
"jerry"," Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to 
              me."
"jerry"," Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't 
              fit him "
"jerry"," I'm glad you enjoyed it."
"george"," Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen 
              the"
"george"," Where you going?"
"george"," You're fresh  You're very fresh. You seem"
"jerry"," It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing 
              off her"
"elaine"," See, what did I tell ya?"
"jerry"," And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. 
              She"
"elaine"," Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when 
              I can"
"jerry"," I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's 
              like ..."
"elaine"," Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please."
"george"," Well, I heard a noise."
"jerry"," What noise?"
"george"," You know, .. blah ..."
"jerry"," What blah?"
"george"," From the bathroom."
"jerry"," Oh, you think she was refunding?"
"george"," Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating 
            "
"elaine"," So you're concerned."
"george"," Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. 
            "
"jerry"," In a manner of speaking."
"george"," Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what 
            "
"kramer"," Here's your scrubber back."
"jerry"," Thanks."
"george"," Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out 
              the "
"jerry"," A matron?"
"george"," Yeah"
"jerry"," uh, well I can't help you there ."
"george"," Wha?"
"kramer"," Nothin'"
"george"," You know a matron?"
"kramer"," Me?"
"george"," You"
"kramer"," No."
"george"," Kramer, "
"kramer"," Well, now look, just leave me alone."
"george"," Well, what is it?"
"kramer"," No, don't, don't make me"
"george"," Wha?"
"kramer"," No, I can't, all right I can't ... "
"george"," Who?"
"kramer"," ... My mother's a matron!"
"elaine"," Babs? "
"kramer"," Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? 
              Anything else you "
"george"," Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding."
"kramer"," Look, George, I can't help ya, all right."
"george"," Why not? Why not?"
"kramer"," let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother 
              in five"
"george"," Come on, Kramer."
"kramer"," I can't I can't"
"jerry"," Kramer you're going to have to face her some time "
"kramer","  b'd b'd"
"elaine"," Hello  Oh, my goodness. What happened?"
"elaine"," Oh"
"elaine"," Oh, you'll be playing ..."
"elaine"," There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and 
              uh uh mah jong, "
"elaine"," ... and biking and .."
"elaine"," ... hiking ..."
"elaine","  Could I ..."
"elaine"," , You know it's not important I'm gonna, 
              ok, well, you know."
"kramer"," Ma?"
"george"," Cosmo?"
"jerry"," Why didn't you just ask her for it?"
"elaine"," I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she 
              might never "
"jerry"," Yeah"
"george"," Hey di ho"
"jerry"," C'mon up."
"jerry"," So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?"
"elaine"," augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy"
"jerry"," He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?"
"elaine"," He'll only play with his racquet"
"jerry"," Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch 
              hour and just"
"elaine"," That's stealing?"
"jerry"," Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!"
"elaine"," I know."
"george"," Hey oh."
"elaine"," JERRY Hey"
"jerry"," So what happened with Kramer's mother?"
"george"," It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday 
              at the restaurant"
"jerry"," What's she like?"
"george"," Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened 
              to pick up "
"elaine"," Ah, I'm ready what?"
"jerry"," What is it?"
"george"," I uh got the first name."
"elaine"," You found out Kramer's first name?"
"george"," That's right. You ready? "
"jerry"," We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What 
              is it?"
"george"," Cosmo"
"elaine"," JERRY Cosmo?"
"george"," Cosmo"
"elaine"," JERRY Cosmo"
"elaine"," Cosmo, Cosmo?"
"kramer"," What's so funny? ... wha?"
"elaine"," COSMO?"
"kramer"," All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. 
              out of the bag."
"elaine"," It's not such a bad name."
"kramer"," Well you know all my life I've been running away from that 
              name. "
"jerry"," Hi, is Sandy here?"
"jerry"," I would except I forgot to bring a towel."
"jerry"," So the roommate laughed at everything I said."
"george"," Wow."
"jerry"," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none 
              of"
"george"," Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those."
"jerry"," And the worst part of course is that she also possessed 
              many of the"
"george"," I see."
"jerry"," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
"george"," Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my 
              advice to you"
"jerry"," Can't be done, huh?"
"george"," The Switch?"
"jerry"," ""The Switch."""
"george"," Can't be done."
"jerry"," I wonder."
"george"," Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization 
              no one has"
"jerry"," They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages."
"george"," Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and"
"jerry"," The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it 
              with or without"
"george"," All right, dammit, I'm in."
"jerry"," I couldn't do it without you."
"george"," All right. Let's get to work."
"george"," All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some 
              sleep. I'll see"
"jerry"," Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! 
              It's true! You"
"george"," We'll come up with something."
"jerry"," Yeah, sure we will."
"george"," All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}"
"george"," I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!"
"george"," All right. Let's go over it again, one more time."
"jerry"," All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage 
               trois with her"
"george"," That's right."
"jerry"," And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged 
              effect."
"george"," Keep going."
"jerry"," At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the 
              roommate to"
"george"," Continue."
"jerry"," The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy 
              even as"
"george"," A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy 
              is known to"
"jerry"," Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw 
              in it"
"george"," You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do 
              with you. She"
"jerry"," It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple."
"george"," {George, finger in the peanut butter jar} This is what 
              I do."
"elaine"," Uh, no, I'm OK."
"elaine"," Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it."
"elaine"," No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet."
"elaine"," All right. I'm going I'm going"
"elaine"," Give it give it .."
"elaine"," All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention 
              any of this to "
"kramer"," Hi Mr. Clotworthy"
"kramer"," Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine."
"kramer"," My mom Babs."
"kramer"," Yes, It's a fine day"
"kramer"," Hey, everything my man."
"jerry"," You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe 
              its"
"jerry"," Uh?"
"kramer"," You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that 
              matron job."
"kramer"," Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're 
              clean?"
"kramer"," I've got plenty of ideas."
"george"," ... so glad. "
"george"," And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh"
"george"," Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?"
"george"," Babs left?"
"george","Ah Ha."
"george"," I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert."
"george"," How 'ya feelin'?"
"newman"," Hi Babs"
"newman"," Minding my own business."
"newman"," What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?"
"newman"," ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of"
"jerry"," Hey"
"george"," What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. 
            "
"jerry"," Ah, that's a shame."
"george"," Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. "
"jerry"," Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there."
"george"," So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?"
"jerry"," No actually, she took it pretty well."
"george"," So what happened?"
"jerry"," She's into it."
"george"," Into what?"
"jerry"," The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said"
"george"," That's unbelievable. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's a scene man."
"george"," Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that"
"jerry"," What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it."
"george"," You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not 
              goin"
"jerry"," I can't. I'm not an orgy guy. "
"george"," Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by 
              accident."
"jerry"," Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes 
            "
"george"," If only something like that could happen to me."
"jerry"," Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either."
"george"," I know."
"jerry"," Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?"
"elaine"," No, I got caught."
"jerry"," What do you mean you got caught?"
"elaine"," Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going 
              to get a job. "
"jerry"," I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for 
              taking your own "
"elaine"," Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy 
              this afternoon."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hi Cosmo."
"elaine"," Hi Cosmo"
"kramer"," Thanks man."
"jerry"," Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?"
"kramer"," Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore."
"jerry"," Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?"
"kramer"," Yeah"
"jerry"," Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today. 
            "
"kramer"," All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's"
"george"," Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She 
              hung me "
"kramer"," She quit."
"george"," It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I 
              just think you "
"kramer"," Don't talk to me George, talk to her."
"george"," Well where is she?"
"kramer"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Ma!"
"newman"," We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?"
"jerry"," Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with 
              the sticks."
"elaine"," I know. I need a lesson."
"jerry"," You stink. You know you stink. What is this?"
"elaine"," Oh. My ballet tickets."
"jerry"," Oh. Your ballet tickets."
"elaine"," Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?"
"jerry"," No, but I've seen people on tiptoes."
"elaine"," You know, I'm going as a beard."
"jerry"," A beard?"
"elaine"," Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, 
              I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably"
"jerry"," Yes."
"elaine"," So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited 
              us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's"
"jerry"," Why are you doing this?"
"elaine"," Swan Lake, at the Met."
"kramer"," Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something."
"elaine"," Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?"
"kramer"," I think he looks fantastic."
"elaine"," Oh, come on."
"kramer"," No, I never realized what an attractive man he is."
"george"," Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? 
              Excuse me."
"elaine"," You look ridiculous in that thing."
"george"," Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* 
              bit worried that you may have missed the boat?"
"elaine"," Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your 
              brain."
"george"," Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if 
              you must. But let me tell you something, with "
"kramer"," You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous 
              woman, she called me up this"
"jerry"," Well what about me?"
"kramer"," No I think he's got you beat buddy."
"george"," So she's gorgeous."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago."
"george"," Well have you got a picture?"
"kramer"," No."
"george"," Well, I have to see her."
"kramer"," Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works 
              over at the police station. He's a"
"george"," Really?"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her 
              for you."
"george"," Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. I think he will."
"jerry"," It sounds like an excellent idea."
"kramer"," Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to 
              a homeless person."
"george"," Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to 
              see how those sketch artists do it."
"kramer"," Here you go brother. Some food for you."
"kramer"," Now are you going to be here in an hour?"
"kramer"," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's 
              that nut?"
"kramer"," Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier."
"george"," Pouty? I like that."
"jerry"," You can't go wrong with pouty."
"george"," I'm excited about the pouty."
"kramer"," All right George, come on, take a look."
"george"," Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous."
"jerry"," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?"
"george"," Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the 
              police woman?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law 
              on my side."
"kramer"," Hey, man. Enjoy the food?"
"kramer"," Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now."
"kramer"," Woah, woah, that's mine."
"kramer"," No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't 
              give away tupperware."
"kramer"," I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware 
              you just assume."
"elaine"," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open 
              minded."
"elaine"," Yes indeed."
"elaine"," Really. Why?"
"elaine"," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's 
              not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if "
"elaine"," Oh, hi honey."
"elaine"," Oh it was such a great night."
"jerry"," And did they suspect anything?"
"elaine"," No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him 
              honey."
"jerry"," And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend 
              for homosexuals."
"elaine"," Oh it was such a great night. Oh."
"jerry"," You said that already."
"elaine"," Oh I did?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Oh."
"jerry"," Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?"
"elaine"," He's incredible."
"jerry"," Yeah, but?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I know."
"jerry"," So?"
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?"
"elaine"," Well it did occur to me."
"jerry"," You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not 
              going to suddenly switch sides. Forget "
"elaine"," Why? Is it irrevocable?"
"jerry"," Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes 
              his team. He's set with that team."
"elaine"," We've got a good team."
"jerry"," Yeah, we do. We do have a good team."
"elaine"," Why can't he play for us?"
"jerry"," They're only comfortable with *their* equipment."
"elaine"," We just got along *so* great."
"jerry"," Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              no possibility of sex."
"elaine"," No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. 
              I perceived a possibility Jerry."
"jerry"," You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters. "
"elaine"," I realize that."
"jerry"," Are you that desperate?"
"elaine"," Yes I am."
"jerry"," So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's 
              settled. First date, no weapons... All right"
"jerry"," What are you looking for?"
"kramer"," Tupperware."
"jerry"," Sorry. I don't have any tupperware."
"kramer"," I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious 
              casserole, but now it won't keep because"
"jerry"," What about a plastic bag?"
"kramer"," You must be kidding."
"jerry"," What is the difference?"
"kramer"," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness."
"george"," So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, you talked to her."
"george"," Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you."
"kramer"," Yeah well we go way back."
"george"," Why didn't anything happen between you two?"
"kramer"," Who's to say it didn't?"
"jerry"," So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?"
"george"," Yes I did."
"jerry"," What did you say to her?"
"george"," What do you think I said?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"george"," I told her the truth."
"jerry"," As you see it?"
"george"," Yes, as I see it."
"jerry"," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?"
"george"," What hat?"
"jerry"," You know, you're little hair hat there."
"george"," No."
"jerry"," Don't you think she could tell?"
"kramer"," No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful 
              job."
"jerry"," Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks 
              away."
"george"," You only think that because you know me."
"jerry"," Have you noticed people staring at your head?"
"george"," I noticed people staring at my head because they like what 
              they see."
"jerry"," Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about 
              it."
"kramer"," No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go 
              over there bald, I never would have"
"george"," Look, I guarantee she won't know."
"kramer"," Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the 
              precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou."
"jerry"," Oh, I'll split a cab with you."
"kramer"," Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry."
"jerry"," Hi Sarge."
"kramer"," Sure. I will."
"george","  Oh my god, there she is. That's the 
              face, just like the picture."
"george"," Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you."
"george"," No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago."
"george"," Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile."
"jerry"," What's that?"
"jerry"," Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that 
              their pants are actually on fire?"
"jerry"," Really."
"jerry"," No."
"jerry"," I admit it. I don't watch it."
"jerry"," The poly?"
"elaine"," Melrose Place?"
"jerry"," Yes. Melrose Place."
"elaine"," I just didn't know you watched that."
"jerry"," Well I do."
"elaine"," I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or 
              join in the conversation."
"jerry"," Well maybe I was a little embarrassed."
"elaine"," You mean this whole time we could have been discussing 
              Sydney and Michael and Jane..."
"jerry"," And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed 
              it."
"elaine"," Why? Why were you so embarrassed?"
"jerry"," The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test 
              and that needle's going to be going wild."
"elaine"," That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?"
"jerry"," It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing 
              to."
"elaine"," So what are you going to do?"
"jerry"," I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine."
"elaine"," Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?"
"jerry"," Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, 
              duplicitous, deceptive minds of our"
"elaine"," Oh god this tastes terrible."
"jerry"," Did you shake it up?"
"elaine"," No."
"jerry"," You gotta shake it up."
"elaine"," No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything."
"jerry"," Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me."
"elaine"," So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and 
              his wife."
"jerry"," So tonight are you going to make the move?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I think I might."
"jerry"," Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?"
"george"," That's an interesting question."
"jerry"," How so?"
"george"," How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!"
"elaine"," What do you mean bald?"
"george"," What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald."
"jerry"," She's bald?"
"george"," She's bald."
"elaine"," Oh come on."
"george"," Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there 
              she was (waving his hand over his"
"elaine"," Well maybe she got a haircut or something."
"george"," Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor 
              and says ""Give me the Larry Fine."""
"jerry"," Women go bald?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," You fixed me up with a bald woman."
"kramer"," Bald?"
"george"," Yeah, that's right."
"elaine"," Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because 
              they're bald."
"george"," So?"
"elaine","  You're bald!"
"george"," No I'm not. I *was* bald."
"george"," Elaine."
"george"," No, no, no Elaine."
"elaine","  I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm 
              doing with it."
"george"," Nooooo."
"elaine"," Well I figured that's what couples do."
"elaine"," Well it was easy. Really."
"elaine"," Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Upstairs?"
"elaine"," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... 
              changing teams?"
"elaine"," Have you ever thought about it?"
"elaine"," Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*."
"george"," I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, 
              it was the best thing that ever happened to"
"jerry"," Good to have you back."
"george"," And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to 
              keep seeing the bald woman."
"jerry"," She's as good as anybody else."
"george"," Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't 
              a lot of hair on it."
"jerry"," Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like 
              a bald-again."
"george"," Going to need a little more coffee here."
"jerry"," So George, how do I beat this lie detector?"
"george"," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you."
"jerry"," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can 
              help me."
"george"," Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach 
              me to sing like you."""
"jerry"," All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe 
              I'm doing this."
"george"," Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe 
              it."
"elaine"," Hey, I did it."
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," I turned him. He defected."
"jerry"," Get out!  How? How did you do that?"
"elaine"," Because I'm a *woman*.  Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-"
"jerry"," Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to 
              every woman who's ever said ""Too"
"elaine"," Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. 
              Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot."
"jerry"," Jerry Seinfeld."
"jerry"," 129 West 81st street."
"jerry"," I don't know."
"jerry"," I don't know."
"jerry"," I don't know."
"jerry","  Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, 
              he slept with her sister. He tricked"
"jerry"," He went back? What do you mean he went back?"
"elaine"," He went back."
"jerry"," I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, 
              the sex, the shopping."
"elaine"," Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have 
              access to the, uh... equipment, what,"
"jerry"," You can't. That's why they lose very few players."
"elaine"," Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance."
"jerry"," Well there's always a place for you, on our team."
"elaine"," Yeah.  Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?"
"jerry"," Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes."
"elaine"," Okay."
"jerry"," Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started."
"elaine"," Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire 
              what you've done."
"george"," Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry."
"elaine"," What is the matter?"
"george"," I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. 
              Heh, you like that one? A woman"
"kramer"," Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with 
              that piece off and was devastated. You"
"elaine"," I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, 
              and it made him act like a jerk."
"jerry"," All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on."
"jerry"," Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug."
"kramer"," Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, 
              you're a slippery one. You'd better"
"kramer"," Me?"

      "
"george"," Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You "
"jerry"," I would think."
"george"," So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for

"jerry"," Hello.  Oh, hi Nana.  What? Oh. Oh, alright, 
      "
"jerry"," I have to go over to my grandmother's."
"george"," What for?"
"jerry"," I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her."
"george"," So, what, no lunch?"
"jerry"," No, we have time."
"george"," Oh. How's she doing?"
"jerry"," Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has "
"george"," Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. 
      "
"jerry"," Like toothpaste?"
"george"," Ya-hah."
"jerry"," There's a squeeze ketchup."
"george"," I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup."
"jerry"," Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason 
      "
"george"," Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze."
"jerry"," I really don't see the difference."
"george"," Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle."
"jerry"," It's subtle."
"george"," Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?"
"jerry","  Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Ah, she's with her friend Wendy."
"george"," Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?"
"jerry"," Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her."
"george"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did 
      "
"elaine","  Hey."
"george"," You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia."
"jerry"," Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that."
"george","  Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for "
"jerry"," No, I told you I admire your hearing."
"jerry"," No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing."
"elaine","  Wendy, George.  Wendy."

"elaine","  George."
"george","  Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble."
"george","  Oh! Okay."
"george"," Oh, thank you."
"elaine"," Bye Wendy. I'm sorry."
"jerry"," Bye."
"elaine","  What did you do that for?"
"george"," What?"
"elaine","  Ask about your arm."
"george"," I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm."
"elaine"," She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal 
      "
"george"," Why not?"
"elaine"," Because, it is what she does."
"george"," I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting "
"elaine"," George, you got a little something, right here."
"george","  People think they're so "

"george","  What're you getting?"

"jerry"," She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
"
"elaine"," Oh, I could never say anything to her about that."
"jerry"," Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like "
"elaine"," Yeah. Hah."
"george"," Well, just tell Kramer to tell her."
"elaine"," No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it."
"jerry"," What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come 
      "
"elaine","  Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's 
      "
"elaine","  ...Kramer."
"kramer"," Hello, boys and girls."
"jerry"," Speak of the devil."
"kramer"," Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy."
"jerry"," What for?"
"kramer"," Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby 
      "
"jerry"," Why?"
"kramer"," So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna

"jerry","  I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the "

"jerry","  You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?"
"kramer"," You got that straight."
"jerry"," I told you, forget it."
"kramer"," Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't

"jerry"," You're robbing me."
"kramer"," Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate

"elaine"," Wha... W.. Are you going home?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?"
"kramer"," Why?"
"elaine"," No reason.  Just wanna see you again."
"jerry","  So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?"
"elaine"," Yeah, she'll be here any second."
"jerry"," Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer

"elaine"," Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her 
      "
"jerry"," Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to "
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"jerry"," Come on up."
"elaine"," Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?"
"jerry"," No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first "
"elaine"," What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's "
"jerry"," It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, 
      "
"elaine"," How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?"
"jerry"," Elaine, now you're being ridiculous."
"elaine","  That's her. That's her."
"jerry","  Hi Wendy."
"jerry","  Would you like something to drink?"
"jerry","  There you go."
"jerry"," Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars."

"elaine"," Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer."
"kramer"," Hey! Jerry!"
"jerry"," C'mon, that's not fair!"
"kramer"," I told you I was gonna get it."
"jerry"," No, c'mon Kramer.  Gimme that picture."

"elaine"," Oh, Kramer."
"elaine"," You wanna go out with him?"
"elaine"," Well, it's just that... uh, I don't..."
"elaine"," I'm just thinking about the question."

"jerry"," Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible..."
"jerry"," ...You can't put that picture up."
"kramer"," Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to

"kramer"," Hey..."
"kramer"," ...Steve.  Ah, you see?"
"elaine"," Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you."
"kramer","  Well, how do you do?"

"jerry"," ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine."
"george"," You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? 
              I *need* a"
"jerry"," Can I just get it opened first?"
"george"," I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there 
              rubbing"
"jerry"," All right, all right. Here. [hands George a piece of the 
              candy"
"george","  Oh, that's good. That's very good."
"jerry"," You feel better?"
"george"," Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because 
              I need"
"jerry"," Nancy Klopper?"
"george"," Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog 
              here."
"jerry"," All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna 
              make sure,"
"george"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in 
              the vault."
"jerry"," It's not even a question of that. The point is when something 
              like"
"george"," You're gonna tell me...or not."
"jerry"," All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need 
              a"
"george"," I got a headboard."
"jerry"," Is it padded?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," Good. How tall is she?"
"george"," Five-foot four. Why?"
"jerry"," You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your 
              heights."
"george"," I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this."
"jerry"," George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone 
              again."
"jerry"," Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I 
              like the"
"george"," Is it a clockwise swirl?"
"jerry"," I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone."
"kramer"," Here you go, buddy. ."
"jerry"," What is it?"
"kramer"," *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the 
              microphone?"
"jerry"," When did you do this?"
"kramer"," In my spare time. . You know, I'm working 
              on one"
"jerry"," Oh... Why Fusilli?"
"kramer"," Because *you're* silly. Get it? "
"jerry"," Well, thank you very much."
"george"," So, did you get your new plates?"
"kramer"," Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. 
              Somebody"
"george"," What do they say?"
"kramer"," Assman."
"jerry"," Assman?"
"kramer"," Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!"
"jerry"," Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?"
"george"," Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's."
"jerry"," It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It 
              could be"
"kramer"," Yeah, or it could be a proctologist."
"jerry"," Yeah. Proctologist."
"george"," Come on! No doctor would put that on his car."
"kramer"," Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually 
              have a very"
"kramer"," Oh! There's my phone. "
"george"," So, where you gonna stick this "
"jerry"," I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it."
"jerry"," Hey, David."
"jerry"," Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move."
"jerry"," What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used 
              it on"
"jerry"," The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's 
              nothing."
"jerry"," Swirl."
"jerry"," Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*."
"jerry"," You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other 
              peoples?"
"jerry"," Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna 
              do it out"
"jerry"," Fine."
"george","  
              Uh...you"
"george"," You don't like the move?"
"george"," You're kidding."
"george"," Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine."
"elaine"," Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!"
"elaine"," What?!!"
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," Oh, oh, come on, please?"
"elaine"," Oh, so---so that's it?"
"kramer"," ""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think 
              I have what"
"kramer"," Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer.  Proctology."
"kramer"," Thanks. Have a good day."
"kramer"," I just can't get over how fantastic you look."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah."
"kramer"," You got that straight!"
"jerry"," You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed 
              up the"
"george"," Supposed to close with the swirl?"
"jerry"," Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression"
"george"," Yeah, yeah, should've written it down."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"jerry"," C'mon up.  You know what? Do me a favor. 
              Don't"
"jerry"," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight 
              hundred"
"george"," What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's 
              what it"
"jerry"," Except that it's not Putty."
"george"," What happened to Putty?"
"jerry"," Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to 
              this other"
"george"," Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you 
              think?"
"jerry"," Hey, Elaine."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, hello."
"jerry"," Is it something I said?"
"elaine"," Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move 
              anymore."
"jerry"," Really?"
"elaine"," Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this 
              thing."
"jerry"," What is it?"
"elaine"," Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what 
              it's"
"jerry"," Huh."
"elaine"," I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up 
              a lot of"
"george"," Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle"
"elaine"," Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
"george"," I think that's mine."
"elaine"," I'm not surprised."
"jerry"," Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time 
              you're"
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this 
              garage is"
"elaine"," An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?"
"jerry"," Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. 
              Just"
"elaine"," [takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting 
              on the"
"jerry"," That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
"elaine"," Fusilli Jerry?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Kramer made it."
"george"," All right, listen, I'll see you guys later."
"jerry"," Hey, Assman!"
"kramer"," Hey, well, this is Sally."
"jerry"," Hi."
"elaine"," Hi."
"kramer"," Shall we go?"
"elaine"," Hey, let me ask you a question."
"elaine"," What do you charge for blown shocks?"
"elaine"," Two, three hundred?"
"elaine"," Ah. "
"elaine"," What about a bad gasket?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Like a terrible gasket."
"elaine"," Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."
"elaine"," Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car."
"elaine"," Oh."
"elaine"," Is that with the parts and labor?"
"elaine"," Hmm."
"elaine"," Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle...."
"george"," It just came to me."
"george"," You mean in the end?"
"george"," A counter-clockwise swirl."
"george"," What?"
"george"," Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt."
"george"," It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all."
"george"," You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!"
"jerry"," Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping 
              me"
"elaine"," So what are you going to do?"
"jerry"," Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth 
              this."
"elaine"," Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore? 
            "
"jerry"," Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do 
              you know"
"jerry"," Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
"jerry"," I don't know. Why?"
"jerry"," What do you mean?"
"jerry"," Really, stopping short. That's a good move."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hey, Frank."
"kramer"," C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking 
              about. "
"kramer"," Bro."
"kramer"," Bro!"
"jerry"," Oh, my god!"
"jerry"," If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it."
"elaine"," Me either."
"george"," They say this guy's the best."
"jerry"," He had to use cork-screw pasta."
"kramer"," Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
"kramer"," The name on the boat. Look at it."
"jerry"," Assman!"
"kramer"," Yeah , he's the Assman! 
              Jerry,"
"george","  I am."
"kramer"," Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently 
              get the"
"kramer"," So...you're the Assman."
"george"," Ma, don't cry!"
"george"," Ma, your eyes!"
"jerry"," What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that 
              gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll 
              be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. "
"elaine"," Is that the supermodel?"
"jerry"," Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six 
              hours."
"elaine"," I thought you had a show in Ithaca."
"jerry"," I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back 
              and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport."
"elaine"," Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and 
              I am telling him that I am quitting."
"jerry"," So that's it? You know I never even met the guy. "
"elaine"," I've had enough. I am marchin' in."
"jerry"," You're marchin' in."
"elaine"," I'm marchin'. "
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. Elaine's quitting."
"george"," Really?"
"elaine"," I'm marchin' in."
"george"," I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world."
"jerry"," How 'bout the march out?"
"george"," Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're 
              losing."
"elaine"," This is it. Wish me luck."
"jerry"," Get a march goin'! March it! "
"george"," Jerry, I need to borrow your camera."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan 
              up at the office."
"jerry"," What for?"
"george"," They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with 
              this guy as it is. "
"jerry"," Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?"
"george"," It better be."
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you."
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt..."
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine","  Mr. Pitt..."
"elaine"," Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with 
              the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,"
"elaine"," We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want 
              you to live a long, long time."
"george","  Look at this, I only have one picture 
              left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?"
"george"," Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for 
              us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go...  Anyone 
              ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must 
              get that all the time."
"george"," No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance... 
            "
"jerry"," Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard."
"george"," A little? Come on."
"jerry"," Well, you still shouldn't have said it."
"george"," You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?"
"jerry"," Maybe."
"george"," Boy, that is so unfair. I would've marched on Selma if it was<br/>
              in Long Island."
"jerry"," You'd have marched on Great Neck?"
"george"," Absolutely. I still might. I always hated those girls. They<br/>
              would never date me."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey, there you are."
"kramer"," So you ready?"
"george"," For what?"
"jerry"," He's taking me to the airport. But we've got a few minutes."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. What? You got no luggage?"
"jerry"," This is it. I'm only going for the day. I just gotta drop by the<br/>
              drugstore and pick up a toothbrush."
"kramer"," Okay."
"george"," Hey, Kramer. Who does that look like?"
"kramer"," I don't know."
"george"," Come on, come on. Not salt, but...?<br/>
              Kramer What, Pepper Johnson?"
"george"," No. Sugar Ray Leonard."
"kramer"," Oh, no way."
"george"," All right, I'll tell you what. I'll bet you the next three people I<br/>
              ask... two of them will say Sugar Ray."
"kramer"," How much? $ 100? $200? $ 1000?"
"jerry"," Hey wait a second, what are you doing? You're not betting.You<br/>
              know he's not supposed to bet."
"kramer"," Come on, Jerry, it's a lock."
"jerry"," Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three<br/>
              years now. Don't start again."
"kramer"," But it's a lock, Jerry!"
"jerry"," No!"
"jerry"," What're you doing about Morgan?"
"george"," You know what would be great? If he could see me with<br/>
              some of my black friends."
"jerry"," Yeah except you don't really have any black friends. Outside of<br/>
              us, you don't have any white friends either."
"george"," Hello, Joe?"
"george"," It's me. George Costanza."
"george"," Remember I was here a while back? Breakfast at Tiffany's<br/>
              together?"
"george"," Well, I've rented another video, Joe. And there's some<br/>
              popcorn. I thought we could do it again."
"george"," Remy. Hi."
"george"," Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie."
"george"," You know, Remy, I was thinking. Last time we were<br/>
              together, you..."
"jerry"," That's great. You know what? Leave it. Just pull the car around"
"kramer"," You sure?"
"jerry"," Yeah. I'll take care of it. Just throw that in there, would you?"
"jerry"," Take an antihistamine.They're over there."
"jerry"," Yeah, they're great."
"jerry"," I just saw them. Oh, here. Here you go."
"jerry"," Have a good day, sir."
"kramer"," This is your swanky Diplomat's Club."
"jerry"," I don't see Katie anywhere."
"kramer"," What's this, a fellow club member?"
"jerry"," No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college<br/>
              tours. She thinks I'm some big celebrity that has to be pampered and<br/>
              explained every little thing."
"kramer"," Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks before my flight."
"jerry"," Oh, hi, Katie."
"jerry"," Yes, I followed the planes."
"jerry"," Thanks. Thanks for telling me."
"elaine"," What's going on?"
"elaine"," Oh my God."
"elaine"," Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... 
              shopping. How did this happen?"
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist."
"elaine"," I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. "
"jerry"," Yes, I know. I've flown before."
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," Hey, how you doin'?"
"kramer"," Name's Kramer."
"kramer"," Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes 
              flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute 
              they're arriving."
"kramer"," Bet? Um, not betting."
"kramer"," I haven't made a bet in three years, I-"
"kramer"," Okay, how much?"
"kramer"," You're on, cowboy!"
"george"," How ya doin'?"
"george"," Nice day today."
"george"," I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?"
"kramer"," C'mon Seattle, let's go."
"kramer"," Seattle, yeah!"
"kramer"," All right, c'mon, let's go again."
"elaine"," Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?"
"elaine"," You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?"
"jerry"," I don't care."
"jerry"," Who?"
"jerry"," I don't care, why are you telling me this?"
"jerry"," Why would I freak out?  Pilot..."
"jerry"," Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to 
              see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those 
              orange cones you have on the throughway...  on the way... 
              up here... um... I.."
"jerry"," No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the 
              audience really freaked me out."
"jerry"," If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. 
              I became obsessed with him."
"jerry"," Oh, it doesn't matter now."
"jerry"," Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!"
"kramer"," All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon."
"kramer"," All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. "
"kramer"," Yeah, it's, uh, me."
"kramer"," All right, listen. I need some cash."
"kramer"," I just need it, that's all."
"kramer"," I'm at the airport."
"kramer"," We've been betting on arrivals and departures.  But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash."
"kramer"," Sure you do."
"kramer"," Oh help me man, I'm desperate!"
"jerry","  What is the complication?"
"jerry"," Yes?"
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," I didn't care."
"jerry"," He can't just throw me off the plane!"
"jerry"," But I'm not a disturbance!"
"jerry"," But someone is waiting for me!"
"jerry"," I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!"
"jerry"," Which one do you think I want?"
"jerry"," Then we'll make it the eight."
"jerry"," Hotel?"
"jerry"," No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna 
              be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car."
"jerry"," I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! 
              Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?"
"george"," Yo."
"jerry"," George."
"george"," Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?"
"jerry"," I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's 
              Club..."
"george"," Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated 
              your apartment when you had fleas?"
"jerry"," Carl, I think."
"george"," Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy."
"jerry"," Yeah, he was nice."
"george"," What company was it?"
"jerry"," Defent."
"george"," Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit..."
"jerry"," You need an exterminator?"
"george"," No, not really."
"jerry"," Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?"
"george"," Gotta go."
"jerry"," George, George!"
"jerry"," Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?"
"elaine"," Hello?"
"jerry"," Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go 
              down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to 
              be late."
"elaine"," That's at the airport, right?"
"jerry"," Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll 
              never get another date with her. She'll freak out."
"elaine"," All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself."
"jerry"," I am a little freaked out!"
"elaine"," Calm down, I'll take care of it. "
"jerry"," All right, but you have to go now."
"elaine"," I said I'll take care of it!"
"kramer"," Hey."
"kramer"," Good.  Here's my collateral."
"kramer"," Yeah, don't I know it."
"kramer"," All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?"
"kramer"," Double or nothin'."
"jerry","  Where are we?"
"jerry"," Is this even a road?"
"jerry"," What? Why didn't you wake me up?"
"jerry"," No, road is a major detail!"
"jerry","  Look out!"
"george"," May I help you?"
"george"," Oh, yes of course, come in."
"george"," Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I 
              called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is 
              sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?"
"george"," Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When 
              you fumigated for fleas over there."
"george"," Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really 
              thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, 
              there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on...  Is Mr. 
              Morgan in?"
"george"," He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?"
"jerry"," That's it! No more questions! I don't care!"
"george","  Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's 
              all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh 
              my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, 
              I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl."
"george"," That's... what we used to call him in high school, the 
              exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times."
"kramer"," Yeah, he was."
"kramer"," Oh I accept."
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like 
              yourself. "
"elaine"," Kramer."
"kramer"," Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?"
"elaine"," Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here 
              about his plane in Ithaca?"
"elaine"," Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly 
              delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?"
"kramer"," Boy..."
"elaine"," Uh huh."
"kramer"," C'mon!"
"kramer"," What?"
"elaine"," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. 
              Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!"
"elaine"," Goodbye? "
"jerry"," Bridget!"
"jerry"," Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our 
              whole time together."
"jerry"," Really?  Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!"
"george"," I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the 
              time."
"george"," Check, please."
"george"," Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!"
"jerry","  Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over 
        there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's 
        sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't 
        be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't. 
      "
"jerry"," She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console 
        her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you 
        do in a situation like that? "
"george"," Where were you?"
"jerry"," I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. "
"george"," Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have 
        to console her no matter what. "
"jerry"," Of course."
"george"," When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving 
        from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage."
"jerry"," yeah, "
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," Hey. I gotta go."
"kramer"," Where you going? "
"jerry"," The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical."
"kramer"," Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? 
      "
"jerry"," She might be. She's the star of the show. "
"kramer"," Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, 
        don't tease me. "
"george"," I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan."
"kramer"," So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe."
"george"," Gennice palying today?"
"jerry"," Yeah, maybe."
"kramer"," Who's Gennice?"
"jerry"," That's the understudy. I'm dating her."
"kramer"," Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers 
        of the theater world."
"jerry"," I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back 
        stage and having to think of something to say."
"george"," Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You 
        know that's a real problem."
"jerry"," Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? 
        I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The 
        whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though. "
"elaine"," I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't 
        give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus "
"elaine"," How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things 
        to do."
"elaine"," What?, uh?"
"elaine"," What is so funny?"
"elaine"," The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling 
        me a dog."
"jerry"," How would you know? You don't speak Korean."
"elaine"," Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog 
        the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge "
"kramer"," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could 
        be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG! "
"jerry"," Why don't you go to another nail shop?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just 
        being paranoid. "
"jerry"," What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell 
        you what they're saying."
"elaine"," Yeah, who speaks Korean?"
"jerry"," You know who speaks Korean?<br/>
<br/>
        Elaine No, who?"
"jerry"," George's father."
"elaine"," You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?"
"jerry"," He used to go there a lot on business."
"elaine"," What did he do?"
"jerry"," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, 
        that were manufactured in Korea."
"elaine"," Uh, "
"jerry"," George, does your father speak Korean?"
"george"," Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon. "
"jerry"," Oh, hi Gennice."
"jerry"," This is George, this is Kramer."
"jerry"," Playing today?"
"jerry"," They really stick to that understudy rule."
"kramer"," So she's coming?"
"jerry"," It's okayit's just a hot dog,  everything 
        is going to be okay."
"kramer"," Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi."
"kramer"," Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful."
"kramer"," Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done."
"kramer"," Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here."
"kramer"," Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry."
"kramer"," Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back."
"kramer"," Oh, uh, uh. "
"elaine"," Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the 
        shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?"
"elaine"," uh, ha."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this 
        for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure 
        if you want."
"george"," I watched ""Beaches"" on cable last night.  
         Give me a break."
"elaine"," Uh, Mr. Costanza, I "
"elaine"," Mr. Costanza, I, "

"jerry"," Come on George."
"kramer"," I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE."
"jerry","  Keep going."
"george"," Aaaaaah"
"george"," come on it's just a game."
"kramer","  Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything.

         ""You are the wind"""
"jerry"," Well we"
"jerry","  It's okay. Everything is going to be all right. 
      "
"kramer"," Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! "
"jerry"," Come back another time."
"kramer"," SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're 
        all proud of yourselves."
"kramer"," So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell 
        you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway 
        I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them 
        out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, 
        and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... 
        ...GOOD LUCK... "
"elaine"," Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank."
"elaine"," What'd they say? What'd they say?"
"kramer","  A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want 
        whit e meat or dark? "
"kramer"," Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. 
        It's your ass buster."
"kramer"," yeah, all right, yeah.  They don't have any. 
        But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere."
"kramer"," Now that's impossible."
"elaine","    I don't even 
        know where I'm going."
"elaine"," yes,  I suppose, "
"elaine"," Yes,  you see this  woman, this manicurist,"
"elaine"," Uh,  thanks."
"elaine"," How do you know all that?"
"elaine"," You mean..?"
"elaine"," Oh!"
"jerry"," I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything 
        to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody 
        up. "
"george"," So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my 
        building last night."
"jerry"," Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. 
      "
"jerry"," Stop your crying will ya?"
"george"," You heard him."
"george"," Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't 
        in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh? "
"jerry"," Hey, I had nothing to do with it."
"elaine"," Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent 
        at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost 
        terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and 
        mayhem at once. "
"kramer"," Hi, here. I made this for your. "
"kramer"," It's macaroni Midler. "
"kramer"," Yeah, see how you're singing?"
"kramer"," oh, what's that from?"
"kramer"," Oh You are so freaking talented."
"kramer"," Oh, so look who's here. What do you want."
"jerry"," We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her 
        the whole thing was an accident. "
"kramer"," No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question."
"jerry"," What?<br/>
<br/>
        Kramer Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything 
        to disturb her. "
"george"," Who are you to decide?"
"kramer"," I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS! 
      "
"george"," Hey, look, Kramer,"
"kramer"," AH! I don't want her disturbed. "
"elaine"," Hello"
"elaine"," You're welcome."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"elaine"," Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets 
        to the show."
"jerry"," Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later."
"elaine"," Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job."
"jerry"," Where? "
"elaine"," Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue."
"jerry","  How did you get that?"
"elaine"," I met him."
"jerry"," You met J. Peterman?"
"elaine"," yeah."
"jerry"," What is he like?"
"elaine"," He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% 
        cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for 
        running along side a train,  waving last goodbyes, 
        posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ..."
"jerry","  Yeah, I'll see ya'.<br/>
<br/>

"jerry"," Well, break a leg tonight."
"jerry"," Listen buddy,"

"jerry"," So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes 
        you lose control?"
"jerry"," Good luck."
"elaine"," Oh, she got hurt."
"elaine"," I, uh, wait,"
"jerry"," I had a very interesting lunch with George Costanza today."
"kramer"," Newman ! Stop it!!"
"elaine"," Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved."
"jerry"," Really? What happened?"
"elaine"," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very 
        nice man. "
"jerry"," Isn't he the one with the show on cable?"
"elaine"," Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. 
        Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on. "
"jerry"," That's great. "
"elaine"," I know."
"jerry"," That looks pretty good."
"elaine"," He's in.<br/>
        Jerry Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement 
        yet.<br/>
        Elaine What's to discuss?<br/>
        Jerry Come on! George is getting married!<br/>
        Elaine Is he happy?<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        At the restaurant! George is coming from the bathroom <br/>
        to sit with his bride-to-be.<br/>
<br/>
        George I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is 
        it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?<br/>
        Susan Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.<br/>
        George Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?<br/>
        Susan Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see 
        if it's taken.<br/>
        George A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs 
        exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. 
        That's a complete breakdown of the system.<br/>
        Susan Can we change the subject, please?<br/>
        George Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?<br/>
        Susan No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about 
        it.<br/>
        George It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that 
        the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.<br/>
        Susan Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.<br/>
        George  How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? 
        She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. 
        We don't even share the same interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, he seems pretty happy.<br/>
        Elaine Well, that's all that counts, I guess.<br/>
        Jerry What's the matter?<br/>
        Elaine Oh, nothin'.<br/>
        Jerry Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.<br/>
        Elaine Well, what do you want me to do?<br/>
        Jerry Well, at least have some reaction to it.<br/>
        Elaine Well, I don't.<br/>
        Jerry Maybe you're a little jealous.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?<br/>
        Jerry No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not 
        him.<br/>
        Elaine Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, yeah. Right.<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, right.<br/>
        Jerry Lainy!<br/>
        Elaine Jerry!<br/>
        Jerry You don't wanna get married?<br/>
        Elaine Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.<br/>
        Jerry Oh, come on!<br/>
        Elaine Oh, you come on.<br/>
        Jerry You're such..."
"kramer"," Oh, hey!<br/>
        Jerry Hey.<br/>
        Kramer Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. 
        Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware 
        of this?<br/>
        Elaine Oh, dear.<br/>
        Kramer It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the 
        rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that 
        concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one 
        stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our 
        lives, Jerry?<br/>
        Jerry We're gonna change the system.<br/>
        Kramer Yes!<br/>
        Elaine Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just 
        sorry they didn't lock me up.<br/>

        "
"kramer"," Hey, hey."
"george"," March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?<br/>
        Jerry Oh, all the way."
"george"," You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody 
        I wouldn't turn you in."
"jerry"," Is that so?"
"jerry"," Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?"
"kramer"," Definitely."
"jerry"," You're kidding?"
"kramer"," No, no, I would turn you in."
"jerry"," You would turn me in?"
"kramer"," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it."
"jerry"," I can't believe your a friend of mine."
"kramer"," What kind of person are you going around killing people?"
"jerry"," Well, I am sure I had a good reason."
"kramer"," Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be 
        next?"
"jerry"," But you know me!"
"kramer"," I thought I DID!"
"elaine"," I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need 
        of some guidance here."
"elaine"," Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, 
        George, got engaged ."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just 
        overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment."
"elaine"," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole 
        think makes me . . sick."
"elaine"," Yeah, I don't know what that means."
"elaine"," You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm 
        smart. I'm attractive."
"elaine"," No, no, it's okay."
"elaine"," I don't think so."
"jerry"," So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it."
"kramer"," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
"jerry"," Another Caf Latte?"
"kramer"," You better believe it."
"kramer"," Since when are you so trendy?"
"jerry"," Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole 
        Caf Latte?"
"jerry"," I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte."
"kramer"," I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't 
        looked back. "
"jerry"," Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One 
        show only."
"kramer"," I've always wanted to see this."
"jerry"," You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a 
        Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying 
        to get a table and I missed it."
"kramer"," Well, yeah, lets do it uh?"
"jerry"," Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering. 
      "
"jerry"," Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in."
"kramer"," Maybe I will. "
"george"," Hi, "
"susan"," How was your day?"
"george"," Good, good day. How was your day? "
"susan"," Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?"
"george"," Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry."
"susan"," Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night."
"george"," The Lowers, really?"
"susan"," You don't want to go?<br/>
        George No, I want to go."
"susan"," So what did Jerry have to say?"
"george"," Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have 
        an unbelievable idea today! "
"susan"," Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me."
"george"," Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's 
        something else. Are you ready for this?"
"susan"," Yeah."
"george"," Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the 
        first day of Spring."
"susan"," What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?"
"george"," No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day 
        of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! 
        Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the "
"susan"," If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so.  Say 
        so."
"george"," Still marry , still marry."
"susan"," You don't love me."
"george"," Sstill love. Still love."
"susan"," My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making 
        a mistake."
"george"," No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going 
        to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference 
        to me. It's fine. Really."

"jerry"," Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved."
"george"," How did you know that?"
"jerry"," I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe."
"george"," I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going 
        to collapse and kill herself."
"jerry"," tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. 
        That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity. 
      "
"george"," You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. 
        It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out. "
"jerry"," Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up 
        sex after."
"george"," I didn't have any sex."
"jerry"," You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? 
        I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship."
"george"," I didn't have make-up sex."
"jerry"," In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than 
        make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit."
"george"," Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening! "
"george"," Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich."
"george"," This is amazing.  
        Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll 
        feel better "
"jerry"," . . . Poor bastard."
"jerry"," Good evening, Rabbi."
"jerry"," Well, Rabbi, well."
"jerry"," Yeah, that's right."
"jerry"," What do you mean?"
"jerry"," No."
"jerry"," is that so? "
"jerry"," Really?"
"jerry"," I didn't know any of this."
"jerry"," Hum, well it all comes as news to me. "
"susan"," Hi, how was your day?"
"george"," Good, good day. How was your day?"
"susan"," Ah, it was okay. What's going on? "
"george"," Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to 
        Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute? "
"susan"," Yeah, sure."
"george"," You see this is the thing. . . .  I just feel . . . mumble, 
        cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together,  "
"susan"," George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is 
        what you want."
"george"," Yeah?"
"susan"," Oh, don't worry your head. Of course."
"george"," All right. "
"elaine"," I've got that magazine article for you."
"jerry"," You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside."
"elaine"," Are you"
"jerry"," Understand you had a little talk with him too."
"elaine"," Yeah, talked earlier."
"jerry"," Yes I know, I know. "
"elaine",". . . What does that mean?"
"jerry"," Nothing, nothing. "
"elaine"," He didn't mention . . . "
"jerry"," Yes he did."
"elaine"," He told you about our conversation?"
"jerry"," We had quite a little chat."
"elaine"," He told you about . . ."
"jerry"," Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it 
        was you who were getting married instead of him. "
"elaine"," He told you all that? How could he?"
"jerry"," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say."
"elaine"," Can he do that? "
"jerry"," He did it."
"elaine"," But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth? "
"jerry"," That's what's so fascinating. "
"jerry"," You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let 
        you in with it."
"kramer"," Why not?"
"jerry"," Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie."
"kramer"," Well that's stupid "
"jerry"," That's the rule."
"kramer"," Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that. "
"elaine"," No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why 
        did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about? "
"elaine"," Mrs. Winston?"
"elaine"," What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did 
        you?"
"elaine"," You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth 
        floor."
"elaine"," my god, you didn't."
"jerry"," Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me"
"kramer"," Oh, yow, oow Ah! "
"kramer"," Nothing Nothing. "
"kramer"," I don't have anything. Ask him."
"kramer"," What?! "
"kramer"," Ow"
"jerry"," Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man 
        in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip 
        and keep it to ourselves."
"elaine"," You didn't say this to George, did you?"
"jerry"," No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married 
        instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?"
"elaine"," Yeah that! So, . . ."
"george"," Hey oh. "
"elaine"," GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since 
        it happened. I'm so happy for you."
"george"," Alright, thanks a lot. "
"elaine"," Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it."
"george"," Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...<br/>
        Elaine Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple 
        of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.<br/>
        George Well, I guess I'm getting older.<br/>
        Elaine Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, 
        but um, please, please give my best to Susan.<br/>
        George Yeah.<br/>
        Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations.<br/>
        George Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four 
        of us could go out together sometime.<br/>
        Elaine Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.<br/>
        George Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building 
        that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.<br/>
        Elaine Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.<br/>
        George Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?<br/>
        Jerry Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold 
        your ground or...uh<br/>
        George Nope. I wept like a baby.<br/>
        Jerry What?<br/>
        George Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some 
        reason, I just burst into tears.<br/>
        Jerry You cried?<br/>
        George I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell 
        you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears 
        are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.<br/>
        Jx,Gx &amp; Kx Hey!<br/>
        Jerry Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.<br/>
        Kramer Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. 
        I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.<br/>
        Jerry Suing? What for?<br/>
        Kramer The coffee was too hot.<br/>
        Jerry It's supposed to be hot.<br/>
        Kramer Not THAT hot.<br/>
<br/>
        Scene<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
        Rabbi  The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are 
        empty and meaningless.<br/>
        George Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met 
        this guy the other day.<br/>
        Rabbi A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself 
        overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, 
        let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and 
        that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened 
        to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute 
        while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never 
        going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a 
        subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm."
"george"," And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine."
"elaine"," I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. 
              It was just the "
"george"," Ya know, I was just a little surprised."
"jerry"," Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer 
              that?"
"george"," What about all the loser stuff?"
"elaine"," I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never 
              said that. I said"
"jerry"," I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit 
              it's available, it's"
"george","  Well, scintillating as always."
"jerry"," Where you going?"
"george"," I'm going shopping with Susan."
"elaine"," What kind of shopping?"
"george"," Clothes shopping."
"elaine"," Where are you going?"
"george"," Ross'."
"elaine"," Oh that's a nice store."
"george"," Yeah, it's her uncle's."
"jerry"," Discount?"
"george","  One would hope."
"kramer"," So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies 
              and we stopped off "
"kramer"," Yeah that's right."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Yes I did."
"kramer"," No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion."
"kramer"," Well I think I take a normal sip."
"kramer"," Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the 
              movie theater."
"kramer"," Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?"
"kramer"," It's definitely preposterous."
"kramer"," Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step 
              over someone and"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," No. They put the top on."
"kramer"," Ah No no, I haven't."
"kramer"," So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles."
"kramer"," Jackie. I mean, we have a chance? "
"george"," I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy."
"susan"," Well you could use a little flash."
"george"," All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya 
              know there are a lot"
"susan"," Name one."
"susan"," Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned."
"susan"," O.K."
"george"," See now this I don't get. "
"susan"," What?"
"george"," The security guard."
"susan"," What about him?"
"george"," Why does he have to stand?"
"susan"," Because he's a security guard."
"george"," But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like 
              that all day?"
"susan"," George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him."
"george"," Aren't you concerned about the security guard?"
"susan"," Not really. "
"george","  She's not concerned about the security 
              guard. What"
"susan"," All right George.  
              What do you "
"jerry"," So ah, what did you do last night?"
"elaine"," Nothing."
"jerry"," I know nothing, but what did you actually do?"
"elaine"," Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared."
"jerry"," Wow. That really is nothing."
"elaine"," I told ya."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," What are you all dressed up for?"
"kramer"," Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer."
"jerry"," Oh yeah, how's that looking?"
"kramer"," Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says 
              if there is one"
"elaine"," That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers 
              will vote?"
"kramer"," Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have 
              weeded you out."
"jerry"," Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious."
"kramer"," Oh I can be quite litigious."
"elaine"," What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company 
              because there"
"kramer"," Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty."
"elaine","  Jackie says the top was faulty."
"kramer"," Hey Maestro! "
"kramer"," I'm in here. How's it going."
"jerry"," Hi Bob."
"jerry","  Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro."
"kramer"," Well, this is a surprise ha?"
"kramer"," Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to 
              do this. Do you "
"kramer"," Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while."
"kramer"," Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy."
"jerry"," I hear it's ah beautiful there."
"jerry","  Huh?"
"elaine"," Hello."
"elaine"," I might be Elaine."
"jerry"," This is a, Bob Cobb."
"kramer"," Maestro."
"elaine"," Oh, Maestro."
"elaine"," Enchante."
"elaine"," Jinx buy me a coke."
"elaine"," I know I know. That is so ahh ......"
"elaine"," Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah."
"kramer"," You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings."
"jerry"," Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?"
"kramer"," That's right."
"jerry"," Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro."
"kramer"," Why?"
"jerry"," Because it's a stupid thing to be called."
"kramer"," Jerry he's a conductor."
"jerry"," Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association 
              Orchestra."
"kramer"," Well, he's still a conductor."
"jerry"," Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine."
"kramer"," Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'."
"jerry"," New shirt?"
"george"," Yeah. You like it."
"jerry"," No, not particularly."
"george"," Why, the color?"
"jerry"," Yeah. "
"george"," Too flashy?"
"jerry"," Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for 
              you right?"
"george","  No. "
"jerry","  All right what's it going to be here."
"george"," Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does 
              it bother you "
"jerry"," No."
"george"," See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. 
              I can sense"
"jerry"," Are you sensing anything right now?"
"george"," Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand 
              on his feet, in"
"jerry"," Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert."
"george"," What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that 
              take?"
"jerry"," Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down."
"george"," Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? 
              I would be"
"jerry"," I know you will."
"kramer"," Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called."
"george"," Who?"
"jerry"," His lawyer."
"kramer"," Yeah, Java World wants to settle."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm gonna be rich."
"jerry"," Why are they settling?"
"kramer"," Cause their afraid of bad publicity."
"jerry"," All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?"
"kramer"," Yeah that's right."
"george","  I'm gonna need 
              a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!"
"elaine"," Uh ha."
"elaine"," Oh God. What are you getting Bob?"
"elaine"," Excuse me?"
"elaine"," Yeah, so?"
"elaine"," Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called 
              Maestro while he "
"elaine"," Maestro huh? O.K. "
"kramer"," Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.."
"jerry"," What do you mean?"
"kramer"," Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. 
              And look, it "
"jerry"," So?"
"kramer"," So? My lawsuit. I'm finished."
"jerry"," I thought they wanted to settle."
"kramer"," Well what happens if they want to see it?"
"jerry"," Then you're in a lot of trouble."
"kramer"," Yeah!!"
"george","  Tired?"
"george"," How come uh, no chair?"
"george"," I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a 
              chair."
"george"," No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously 
              a very well "
"george"," Would you like a chair?"
"george"," Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?"
"george"," That's exactly my point."
"george"," Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear 
              one day and find"
"kramer"," I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?"
"kramer"," The Maestro."
"kramer"," My friend he's a conductor."
"kramer"," Well my stomach was burning."
"kramer"," Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work."
"kramer"," Well I ..."
"kramer"," I'm sorry Jackie."
"kramer","  Yeah, get over."
"jerry"," Did you have a good time?"
"elaine"," Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died 
              while he was"
"jerry","  Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus."
"elaine"," Really?"
"jerry"," So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make 
              you call him Maestro."
"elaine"," Yeah, I called him Maestro."
"jerry"," You didn't mind?"
"elaine"," Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to 
              it."
"jerry"," O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great""."
"elaine"," I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great""."
"jerry"," Why not you call him Maestro."
"elaine"," He is a Maestro."
"jerry"," Well, I'm great."
"elaine"," So you say."
"jerry"," What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?"
"elaine"," Yeah.  I'm invited."
"jerry"," You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of 
              the clear blue sky"
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans."
"elaine"," Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there."
"jerry"," In all of Tuscany? I wonder."
"kramer","  I'LL TAKE IT!!"
"kramer"," No."
"kramer"," Well I thought we were lucky to get anything."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Well I didn't hear any Plus."
"kramer"," Look, Java World.  Hey listen I'm gonna get 
              out here. I'm "
"elaine"," Hey. Hi Maestro."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Hey you know we were just talking about you."
"jerry"," Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there 
              were no houses "
"jerry"," No. I'm not really looking."
"jerry"," So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all 
              of Tuscany?"
"jerry"," I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?"
"elaine"," It's BOOKED Jerry!"
"jerry"," How'd you get yours?"
"jerry"," Maybe I'll check out France."
"jerry"," Hey George, do you believe this guy?"
"george"," Who?"
"jerry"," Bob Cobb."
"george"," Bob Cobb?"
"jerry"," You know, the Maestro."
"george"," Oh I missed the Maestro?"
"jerry"," Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where 
              in Tuscany to rent."
"george"," Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?"
"jerry"," No."
"george"," So what do you care?"
"jerry"," I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to 
              keep me out of "
"george"," Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. 
              Do you "
"jerry"," I have no idea."
"george"," It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota."
"jerry"," Oh, no way it's that big."
"george"," It's a big region."
"jerry"," Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?"
"george"," I don't know why I bother even talking to you."
"jerry"," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head."
"george"," All right."
"george"," So I spoke to the security guard."
"jerry"," Yeah and?"
"george"," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought 
              him a chair,"
"jerry"," So are you gonna get him a chair?"
"george"," Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking 
              about a bar stool."
"jerry"," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check 
              things out. With a"
"george"," Oh I think I'd go for the back."
"jerry"," Swivel?"
"george"," I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's 
              chairs. What"
"jerry"," I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents 
              used to have a "
"george"," You mean one of those vinyl things?"
"jerry"," Yes."
"george"," Vinyl yeah, maybe."
"jerry"," How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? 
              Wait a "
"george"," Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside."
"jerry"," Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little 
              Italy."
"george"," What do you think about a rocking chair?"
"kramer","  You can't put a limit 
              on my cafe lattes,"
"jerry"," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?"
"kramer"," Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of 
              cafe lattes. But I'm"
"jerry"," That's it?"
"kramer"," That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for 
              you. No problem."
"jerry"," You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein."
"kramer"," Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to 
              tell."
"jerry"," You're racing!"
"kramer"," Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye."
"elaine","  Oh Bob! Bob!"
"elaine","  Maestro!"
"george"," What's your name?"
"george"," I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking 
              over this "
"george"," Innocent mistake."
"george"," Well, here you go. What do you think?"
"george"," Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go 
              ahead. Check it out."
"jerry"," Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio."
"jerry"," Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio."
"jerry"," Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?"
"jerry"," Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?"
"jerry"," I didn't actually want to rent it."
"jerry"," So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was 
              just wondering if"
"elaine"," It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed 
              to get away."
"elaine"," You're right Maestro."
"kramer"," Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out."
"jerry"," You didn't have to push me."
"kramer"," I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?"
"jerry"," 75,000 lira."
"kramer"," 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?"
"jerry"," Kramer you don't under the conversion rate."
"kramer"," Oh, conversion rate, oh."
"jerry"," You know I don't even know why I brought you."
"kramer"," Nobody put a gun to your head."
"jerry"," Not bad!"
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"elaine"," Hello"
"elaine"," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep."
"elaine"," I wish."
"elaine"," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person."
"elaine"," Oh, all right, James. He he he"
"george"," Your wake up guy asked you out?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly 
        intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie, 
      "
"jerry"," I don't know. Blind date?"
"elaine"," What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never 
        met her."
"jerry"," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her."
"elaine"," At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date."
"jerry"," I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The 
        question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf."
"elaine"," Ah, . . . "
"george"," Now you're off on a topic."
"jerry"," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf."
"elaine"," Uh hu."
"jerry"," Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around 
        the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd 
        possibly be walking around with a sponge."
"george"," You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know 
        you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking 
        blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. "
"elaine"," I think she'd figure it out. "
"elaine"," What? What is this?"
"jerry"," Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit."
"elaine"," Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?"
"jerry"," A healthy person. "
"george","  Ow, Ow you squirted me."
"jerry"," Oh, sorry"
"george"," Boy, it stings."
"george"," No."
"george"," No, not that I know of. "
"george"," Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. "
"jerry"," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date."
"elaine"," I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking."
"jerry"," You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?"
"elaine"," I think I can tell."
"jerry"," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?"
"elaine"," Twenty-five percent."
"jerry"," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. 
        It's a twenty to one shot."
"elaine"," You're way off. "
"jerry"," Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like 
        a leper colony down there."
"elaine"," So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population 
        is undateable?"
"jerry"," UNDATEABLE! "
"elaine"," Then how are all these people getting together?"
"jerry"," Alcohol. "
"elaine","  What is your problem?"
"george"," No problem here."
"elaine"," You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious."
"george"," I had no idea."
"elaine"," Right there. Right there. You just did it again."
"george"," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that 
        Jerry squirted at me."
"elaine"," You're eye still hurts?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too."
"jerry"," Pulp couldn't make it across the table."
"george"," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?"
"jerry"," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks."
"george"," Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's 
        why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso."
"elaine"," What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?"
"george"," Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan. 
      "
"kramer"," Hi guys."
"jerry"," Hi, "
"kramer"," Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's 
        signature? "
"george"," Yeah."
"kramer"," And Buck Showalter's?"
"george"," It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over 
        the office."
"kramer"," Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia 
        store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs. "
"george"," Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees 
        to make a few extra bucks. "
"kramer"," No, of course not. "
"kramer"," You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent 
        it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter."
"kramer"," Why?<br/>
        STEINBRENNER What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the 
        ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something. "
"george"," Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? "
"george"," Birthday card?"
"george"," Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch."
"george"," Of course. Your massage.  Enjoy your massage. "
"elaine"," Hello."
"elaine"," James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!"
"jerry"," Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater."
"jerry"," Well, no, I'm not one of those."
"jerry"," Grandma Memma? "
"jerry"," No, I think I would have remembered Memma."
"jerry"," What do you recommend besides the steak?"
"jerry"," Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?"
"jerry"," You know what? I think I'll just have the salad."
"jerry","  Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?"
"elaine"," Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?"
"elaine","  SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT 
        !"
"elaine"," Dogs. Oh I love dogs."
"george"," Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?"
"george"," Really?"
"george"," Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again."
"george"," Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake 
        up service. She swears by this thing."
"george"," Ah, not yet. "
"george"," Yes sir!"
"elaine"," I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started 
        growling at me."
"jerry"," Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other 
        dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly? "
"elaine"," Huh huh."
"jerry"," Did she mention anything about our lunch?"
"elaine"," Uh, kind of."
"jerry"," What do you mean, ""kind of.""?"
"elaine"," I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. 
        . . . You know. . . . For a man."
"jerry"," What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't 
        respect salad eaters."
"elaine"," You got that right."
"jerry"," But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?"
"elaine"," Um uh."
"jerry"," What is she making?"
"elaine"," I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. 
        She won't mind if you come."
"jerry"," Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery. 
      "
"kramer"," Ah, Mr. Weatherbee. "
"george"," You got the Yankee envelope?"
"kramer"," Sure do."
"george"," oh, "
"kramer"," Here you go."
"george"," Hey, he, "
"kramer"," You'll be pleased to see what's inside."
"george"," What is this?"
"kramer"," You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed 
        birthday card that was inside."
"george"," Who told you to sell the card?"
"kramer"," You did."
"george"," No I didn't! "
"kramer"," No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. 
        "
"george"," I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like 
        acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible."
"kramer"," Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the 
        hospital ."
"george"," Well get it back! It's very important. "
"kramer"," Look, do you want me to get it back or not?"
"george","  Get it back!"
"elaine"," Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?"
"elaine"," Oh, I don't remember them."
"elaine"," Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?"
"jerry"," Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off."
"kramer"," That you Bobby?"
"kramer"," Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing 
        huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person 
        at the New York Yankees needed this card back. "
"kramer"," Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee."
"kramer"," All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, 
        just for you."
"kramer"," For you he would."
"kramer"," Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something 
        for me."
"kramer"," Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card."
"elaine"," What about this candelabra?"
"jerry"," Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton."
"jerry"," I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher 
        uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? 
        "
"elaine"," What did you do, ransack the place after she died?"
"jerry"," This is some FINE mutton."
"elaine"," I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?"
"jerry"," Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . "
"elaine"," It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I 
        should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. 
        Thanks for mutton."
"elaine"," Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what 
        you hear."
"jerry"," What?<br/>
        HOLLY Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them 
        didn't she?"
"jerry"," I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?"
"elaine"," Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a "
"jerry"," Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?"
"elaine"," Did you do with the dogs?"
"jerry"," Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going 
        on?"
"elaine"," These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to 
        get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here."
"jerry"," Why were dogs chasing you?"
"elaine"," They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one 
        day but I can't tell you right now. "
"jerry"," I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed 
        and it's where I sleep. "
"elaine"," We'll have to sleep head to toe. "
"jerry"," Head to toe?"
"elaine"," Head to toe."
"elaine"," Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715."
"jerry"," I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face. 
      "
"elaine"," You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?"
"jerry"," I'll make them later. Uh."
"george"," He's not here?"
"george"," It's impossible. I got him a wake up service."
"george"," . . . gone?"
"jerry"," It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion."
"george"," I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, 
        Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan."
"elaine"," Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly 
        is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her 
        napkins. "
"george"," Napkins?"
"elaine"," I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins. "
"jerry"," Because they were in the pockets of my jacket. "
"elaine"," They were?"
"jerry"," Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton. "
"elaine"," Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost 
        mauled because of that mutton. "
"george"," What exactly is mutton?"
"jerry"," I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket? 
      "
"elaine"," Oh, I must have left it at Jame's "
"jerry"," You spent the night at James's? Did we?"
"elaine"," Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business."
"jerry"," Reversed positions? "
"elaine"," Yeah, you know, head to toe."
"jerry"," So what your genitals are still lined up. "
"elaine"," No, because I slept with my back to him. "
"kramer"," Mr. O'Neill?"
"kramer"," Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me."
"kramer"," No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. 
        I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits. "
"kramer"," Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs."
"kramer"," You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers."
"kramer"," Yeah, well, no good?"
"kramer"," Two is better than one."
"kramer"," Well, Babe Ruth did it."
"kramer"," Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar? "
"kramer"," Well, maybe I did overextend myself."
"kramer"," It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Come on up."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!"
"jerry"," Hey. What's all this?"
"jerry"," I thought we were going out."
"jerry"," Franco?"
"jerry"," I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me."
"jerry"," That is so Franco."
"kramer"," You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one 
        game. Even for Paul O'Neill."
"kramer"," He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me."
"kramer"," Come on Come on!"
"kramer"," GO! GO!!"
"kramer"," An In The Park Home Run!"
"kramer"," All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way "
"kramer"," Huh? "
"kramer"," Yeah, maybe not technically, but "
"kramer"," Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!"
"kramer"," Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that  "
"jerry"," I usually like mine with an angioplasty."
"elaine"," You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What 
        are you doing here?"
"jerry"," What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops."
"elaine"," I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket."
"elaine"," I didn't take your napkins."
"elaine"," Ask Jerry."
"jerry"," We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point 
        is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant."
"george"," No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the 
        card not being here. I, uh, . . . "
"kramer"," Hi, "
"kramer","  Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has 
        to catch a fly ball in his hat."
"kramer"," And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope."
"elaine"," Uh, this is,"
"jerry"," Hey, what happened to my jacket?"
"jerry"," Uh, sometimes I use the sofa."
"george"," You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
"george"," Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan. 
      "
"george"," Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir."
"george"," Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right 
        for it."
"george"," I know."
"george"," I know."
"george"," That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . . "
"jerry","  I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman 
              catalog."
"george"," This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country."
"elaine"," Yeah. What do you do all day?"
"george"," Not that much."
"elaine"," uh-uh."
"jerry"," I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more 
              work."
"george"," Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending 
              that I'm busy."
"jerry"," How do you pull that off?"
"george"," I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all 
              the time, people think that you're"
"elaine"," Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!"
"jerry"," Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!"
"george"," I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one 
              of those little stress dolls."
"elaine"," "
"jerry"," So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan 
              walking shoe yet?"
"elaine"," No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on 
              it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't!"
"jerry"," What marathon runner?"
"elaine"," You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when 
              I was working at Pendant,"
"jerry"," Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept 
              at the Olympics 4 years ago"
"elaine"," Yeah, that's him."
"jerry"," He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?"
"elaine"," Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. "
"jerry"," How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?"
"elaine"," Ah, I know. I know...!"
"jerry"," I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd 
              think you'd have, like, 6 alarm"
"elaine"," Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first 
              race in 3 years."
"jerry"," Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands."
"elaine"," What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility."
"jerry"," You gotta wake him up!"
"elaine"," Eh...he'll get up..."
"elaine"," Hi, Judy."
"elaine"," Fine. "
"jerry"," I've seen her in your building."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," I didn't know she was married."
"elaine","  She's not... and the guy just took off. "
"jerry"," Whom I gonna tell?"
"elaine"," I know, it's just something you have to say..."
"jerry"," He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?"
"george"," I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up."
"jerry"," My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an 
              extra 5 and it never came back"
"kramer"," Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em."
"jerry"," What do you do?"
"kramer"," I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter 
              to seven and..."
"jerry"," Always works?"
"kramer"," It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, 
              your body has an internal"
"george"," uh-uh. What's with the bucket?"
"kramer"," Lomez, he sold me his hot tub."
"jerry"," Hot tub?"
"kramer"," Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. 
              "
"george"," You put a hot tub... in your living room?"
"kramer"," Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage 
              jets oscillating and pulsating, "
"george"," Is that tolerable?"
"kramer"," Oh...it's tolerable...! "
"jerry"," Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded 
              you?"
"kramer"," Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... "
"george"," He uh...doesn't have any running water?"
"jerry"," I don't ask those kind of questions anymore."
"elaine"," Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul."
"jerry"," Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you."
"jerry"," Sorry about the Olympics."
"elaine"," Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get 
              my deadline extended."
"jerry"," Ah...catalog writer's block?"
"elaine"," Yeah, that's funny. "
"jerry","  So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?"
"jerry"," AM/PM."
"jerry"," Ah...the volume."
"jerry"," Ah, separate knob."
"jerry"," Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder 
              than the radio. "
"jerry"," Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have 
              anything to say about it."
"jerry"," Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?"
"elaine"," Jerry..."
"jerry"," It's a simple question..."
"elaine"," I've got an alarm, ok?"
"jerry"," That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because 
              of that alarm clock?"
"elaine"," It works."
"jerry"," Elaine..."
"elaine"," It... works!"
"george"," Eh...come oooon..."
"george"," Well...I've got a lot to do!"
"elaine"," Hey. Sorry I'm late."
"jerry"," You're 40 minutes late. What happened?"
"elaine"," I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?"
"jerry"," No."
"elaine"," What?  What is the problem?"
"jerry"," Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, 
              and you weren't."
"elaine"," uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?"
"jerry"," Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete 
              in a very difficult race,"
"elaine"," Oh are you?!"
"jerry"," Yes I am."
"elaine"," Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!"
"jerry"," Yeah, I know that!"
"elaine"," Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up 
              with some load o'crap for that"
"jerry"," I'm not talking about upside down.  I'm talking about waking"
"elaine"," Hey, Jean-Paul."
"jerry"," Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?"
"kramer","  What's burning?"
"elaine"," Oh!  My muffin!  Oh, shoot! "
"jerry"," What happened?"
"elaine"," Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds."
"kramer"," This was set for 2 minutes. See?"
"elaine","  Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!"
"elaine","  Jean-Paul, it's not 
              my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,"
"elaine","  All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?"
"jerry"," Yeah. I hope so ?!"
"elaine"," Oh that's cute! "
"jerry"," Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell 
              she's doin'! I gotta take over"
"kramer"," Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak."
"jerry"," I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got 
              goin' there."
"kramer"," Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the 
              windows... the air is cold, the"
"kramer","  ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh...  "
"george","  Well, we're certainly glad that you could make 
              it."
"george"," Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah..."
"george"," Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost."
"george"," Well...maybe not as much as this bastard...  I can"
"jerry"," Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm 
              concerned. Concerned that"
"jerry"," I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me 
              put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, "
"jerry"," These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock 
              all night long, just waitin'"
"george"," Hey, you bastards."
"jerry"," Hey, how was the meeting?"
"george"," I really like those sons of bitches."
"jerry"," Sons of bitches?"
"george"," Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either 
              a bastard or a son of a bitch."
"george"," Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. "
"kramer"," Heeeeey..."
"jerry"," How many sweaters you got on?"
"kramer"," Oh...four.  Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? 
              Boiling hot."
"george"," What's goin'on?"
"kramer"," I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water 
              went down to 58 degrees."
"jerry"," Your core temperature?"
"kramer","  Here, feel my hand.  Yeah, 
              feel."
"george"," Hello?"
"george","  Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?"
"george"," What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? 
              Don't they know that's against"
"george"," Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements 
              the minute you land. Our boys"
"george"," You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to 
              Houston. Not as long as you "
"george","  You tell 
              that son of a bitch no Yankee is"
"george"," Mr.Wilhelm..."
"george"," Well I-I..."
"elaine","  It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... 
            "
"george"," Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!"
"jerry"," Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!"
"kramer"," Yeah, I turned up the heat."
"jerry"," Turn up the heat in your apartment! "
"kramer"," I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm 
              waiting for my new heat pump. "
"george"," Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?"
"kramer"," Uh? Oh that must be it."
"george"," It's huge!"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial 
              strength. 16000 BTU's."
"jerry"," Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count 
              on me! "
"george","  What?"
"jerry"," I got the call...!"
"george"," Jean-Paul?"
"jerry","  Jean-Paul! "
"jerry"," Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul. "
"jerry"," All right.  Let's check out the 
              clock. Notch good... 650..."
"jerry"," How about adult contemporary?"
"jerry"," All right...we're going with adult contempo...  now..."
"jerry"," Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 
              AM tomorrow morning."
"jerry"," That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner..."
"jerry"," I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I 
              don't wanna take any chances."
"jerry"," Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you 
              here..."
"jerry"," ...Yeah I am, but I just..."
"jerry"," humm..."
"jerry"," I think I offended the wake-up guy...! "
"jerry","  No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!"
"jerry"," What if he doesn't call now out of spite?"
"jerry","  Not comfortable... "
"elaine"," Jean-Paul?  Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? 
               Jean-Paul?!"
"elaine"," Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! 
              Call me back. "
"elaine"," Judy, hi, listen..."
"elaine"," Oh I didn't tell anyone."
"elaine"," ... Jerry! "
"jerry"," Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a 
              controlled environment."
"jerry"," Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd 
              be polishing that medal"
"jerry"," That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. 
              "
"jerry","  Man that thing is noisy!"
"kramer","  Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! 
              We're almost up to 80 degrees!"
"jerry"," Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 
              and gimme a call."
"kramer"," Yeah, ok. Wait.  Done! "
"jerry"," He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you."
"jerry"," Frankly, I'm a little concerned."
"elaine"," Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand 
              times! It's never looked so"
"jerry"," 402?  Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven 
              Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!"
"jerry"," Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in 
              the car!"
"jerry"," Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity 
              went out!"
"kramer"," Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses! "
"jerry"," What happened to your mental alarm?!"
"kramer"," I guess I hit the snooze... "
"jerry"," Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the 
              way! Make way! Make way!"
"jerry"," All right, go, it's a race! Come on!"
"george"," You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?"
"george"," Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain..."
"jerry"," I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never 
              even went near your building! "
"elaine"," Then how did she find out, Jerry?!"
"jerry"," Maybe you should check with the rabbi."
"kramer","  You want some hot tea?"
"elaine"," Oh no, thank you."
"kramer"," Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!"
"elaine"," There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading!  
              Go Jean-Paul!"
"kramer"," Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! "
"jerry"," Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!"
"elaine"," Go Jean-Paaaaaul!"
"george","  Well, I-I just recently uh..."
"george"," All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We 
              got 61st "
"jerry"," Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?"
"jerry"," You're a shmoopy!"
"jerry"," You're a shmoopy! "
"george"," All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater."
"jerry"," Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for 
              lunch to"
"george"," Hey."
"elaine"," Hey. "
"elaine"," Hi Sheila."
"jerry"," All right, then. I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Bye shmoopy."
"elaine"," Okay. We ready to go?"
"george"," Yes. Please. Please, let's go."
"elaine"," Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger."
"jerry"," No. We gotta go to the soup place. "
"elaine"," What soup place?"
"george"," Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there."
"jerry"," He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the 
              other"
"elaine"," Stunned by soup?"
"jerry"," You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
"elaine"," Huh. All right. Come on."
"jerry"," There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is 
              a little"
"elaine"," Why? What happens if you don't order right?"
"jerry"," He yells and you don't get your soup."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine."
"george"," All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again. 
            "
"jerry"," All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to 
              your right. "
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," The main thing is to keep the line moving."
"george"," All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup 
              in a loud,"
"jerry"," Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. 
              No"
"elaine"," Oh, boy, I'm really scared!"
"jerry"," Elaine."
"elaine"," All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. 
              Whoa! Wow!"
"jerry"," Ar-moire."
"elaine"," How much is this?"
"elaine"," Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these 
              things. "
"jerry"," He gave you the nice face discount."
"elaine"," Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead."
"jerry"," What about the soup?"
"elaine"," I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. "
"jerry","  Pardon."
"george"," This line is huge."
"jerry"," It's like this all the time."
"george"," Isn't that that Bania guy?"
"jerry"," Oh, no. It is. Just be still."
"george"," Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent."
"jerry"," Hard to believe."
"jerry"," Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in 
              line."
"jerry"," Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup 
              again."
"george"," Medium turkey chili. "
"jerry"," Medium crab bisque. "
"george"," I didn't get any bread."
"jerry"," Just forget it. Let it go."
"george"," Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
"george"," $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread."
"george"," Yes, please."
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here."
"elaine"," But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception?"
"elaine"," Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me. 
            "
"elaine"," Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away."
"jerry"," Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?"
"george"," You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that 
              and not"
"jerry"," I gave you a taste. What do you want?"
"george"," Why can't we share?"
"jerry"," I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly"
"george"," Do you hear yourself?"
"jerry"," I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime."
"george"," Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila."
"jerry"," Hi shmoopy."
"jerry"," You're a shmoopy!"
"george"," I'm going."
"jerry"," Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?"
"george"," You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think 
              so."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," I just don't feel like it anymore."
"jerry"," Just like that?"
"george"," Just like that."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer","  Yeah."
"jerry"," Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?"
"kramer"," Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street 
              all"
"jerry"," Well, sit on one of your couch cushions."
"kramer"," Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!"
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this."
"kramer"," Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it."
"elaine"," Do you need anything?"
"kramer"," Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot."
"elaine"," Mulligatawny?"
"kramer"," Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection 
              by one of"
"elaine"," Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?"
"kramer"," He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. 
              Most"
"elaine"," All right. I'll be back."
"kramer"," Wait a second. You don't even know how to order."
"elaine"," Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it."
"kramer"," No. No, Elaine!"
"elaine"," Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?"
"george"," No. I didn't get it."
"elaine"," Why? What happened?"
"george"," I made a mistake."
"elaine"," "
"george"," All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you."
"elaine"," Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking 
              out of"
"george"," Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or 
              do you"
"elaine"," Oh, I know! It is awful!"
"george"," Why do they have to do that in front of people?"
"elaine"," I don't know."
"george"," What is that with the shmoopy? "
"elaine"," Ohh!"
"george"," The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!"
"elaine"," Ohh! Stop it! I know."
"george"," I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one 
              is"
"elaine"," Ugh!"
"george"," And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight."
"elaine"," You know, we should say something."
"george"," You know, we absolutely should."
"elaine"," I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge 
              turnoff"
"george"," I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes. "
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," I still haven't figured him out."
"elaine"," No. Me neither."
"george"," All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode."
"elaine"," Oh, God!"
"george"," Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful."
"george"," Sorry. Thank you."
"elaine"," Hi there. Um, uh --  Oh! Oh! Oh! 
              One"
"elaine"," Never been a big fan.  Um..you know what? Has 
              anyone ever"
"elaine"," Well, I --"
"elaine"," Hmmm?"
"elaine"," What?"
"kramer"," Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?"
"kramer"," You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine."
"kramer"," Huh?"
"kramer"," What is this, huh?"
"elaine"," I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! 
              I'm gonna"
"george"," Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste 
              this."
"elaine"," All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta 
              sit"
"kramer"," Well, b -- it was stolen."
"elaine"," Wha--?"
"kramer"," These street toughs, they robbed me."
"elaine"," Street toughs took my armoire?"
"kramer"," Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You 
              should've"
"elaine"," I can't believe this!"
"kramer"," Well, where's the soup?"
"elaine"," Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out."
"kramer"," Oh...yeah!"
"jerry"," What are you gonna get?"
"jerry"," You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!"
"jerry"," Uh-oh."
"jerry"," Do I know you?"
"elaine"," So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
"jerry"," It was a bisque."
"elaine"," Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has 
              become"
"jerry"," Really?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to 
              be married."
"jerry"," Have you tastes the soup?"
"elaine"," Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. "
"jerry"," See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things 
              up with"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Oh, thanks."
"elaine"," There he is. "
"kramer"," Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire."
"elaine"," Yeah. I know. Me, too."
"jerry"," So, did these thieves want any money?"
"kramer"," No."
"jerry"," They just wanted the armoire?"
"kramer"," Yeah. They were..quite taken with it."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"george"," Hup! Hup!"
"jerry"," Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange 
              lately?"
"elaine"," No. In what way?"
"jerry"," I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, 
              or"
"elaine"," I don't think George has ever thought he's better than 
              anybody."
"george"," Hello."
"jerry"," Hello."
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," Hello."
"elaine"," Hello."
"george"," Were you just talking about me? What's going on? "
"jerry"," Absolutely not."
"george"," Something's going on here."
"kramer"," All right,  I'm gonna go get some soup."
"elaine"," One of these days that guy is gonna get his. "
"george"," So, how was the movie?"
"jerry"," Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs."
"george"," Oh, yeah?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?"
"george"," Happy? Why should I be happy?"
"jerry"," I don't know, but you look like you're happy. "
"george"," Why should I care?"
"jerry"," You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know 
              when"
"george"," All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because 
              the two of"
"jerry"," Is that so?"
"george"," Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,"
"jerry"," Disgusting?"
"george"," People who do that should be arrested."
"jerry"," Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with 
              her."
"george"," Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know. "
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," You shook my hand in that coffee shop."
"jerry"," You're still with the pact?"
"george"," Mmm-hmm. You reneged."
"jerry"," All I did was shake your hand."
"george"," Ah-ha!"
"kramer"," And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like 
              that."
"newman"," One large jambalaya, please."
"kramer"," Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, 
              she's very"
"newman"," Thank you.  Jambalaya!"
"kramer"," How can I possibly thank you?"
"kramer"," You suffer for your soup."
"kramer"," You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup."
"kramer"," Git."
"jerry"," It was stupid of me."
"jerry"," No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding."
"jerry"," What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's 
              no truth"
"jerry"," So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?"
"jerry"," Aw!"
"susan"," Hey, Jerry!"
"jerry"," Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila."
"george"," Oh, yes. Hello."
"george"," No, thanks."
"susan"," Of course."
"george"," Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?"
"jerry"," Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?"
"george"," I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to 
              sit on one"
"jerry"," Well, we're changing the rules."
"george"," Ahh. Good for you."
"susan"," Aw, what are you getting George?"
"george"," I don't know, honey. What do you want to get?  I"
"susan"," Oh, George, you're so sweet."
"george"," Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie."
"susan"," Aww!"
"jerry"," What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want 
              a little"
"jerry"," Yum yum little tuna fishy?"
"george"," Come here."
"kramer"," And..voila!"
"elaine"," "
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!"
"kramer"," Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it? "
"elaine"," The K Man did it!"
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"elaine","  How much did you pay for this thing?"
"kramer"," How 'bout zero?"
"elaine"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"elaine"," What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?"
"kramer"," I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you 
              so callously"
"elaine"," Get out!"
"elaine"," The Soup Nazi gave it to you?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Why?"
"kramer"," Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have 
              it. Wha --"
"elaine"," "
"kramer"," Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh...."
"elaine"," Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank 
              him. I"
"kramer"," Yeah. Well, he's a dear."
"george"," How much tip do you leave on $8.15?"
"susan"," You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so 
              proud of you"
"george"," Huh?"
"susan","  Because you love your little kiki don't 
              you?"
"elaine"," Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful."
"jerry"," I'm heading over to Elaine's."
"kramer"," Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire."
"jerry"," Those two?"
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"jerry"," Are you sure?"
"kramer"," Yeah. That's them."
"jerry"," Well, let's confront 'em."
"kramer"," No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop. "
"jerry"," There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on."
"kramer"," No!"
"jerry"," Let's go."
"kramer"," Excuse me. "
"kramer"," Uh, well, uh, we --"
"kramer"," Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking 
              to each"
"elaine"," I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire 
              life."
"jerry"," I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half 
              a cup of"
"elaine"," Let me see this.  You know what this is? This is 
              a recipe"
"elaine"," So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these 
              to"
"jerry"," Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?"
"elaine"," What do you care?"
"jerry"," Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that 
              soup"
"elaine"," Get out of my way, Jerry."
"jerry"," Elaine, let the man make his soup!"
"elaine"," Don't make me hurt you, Jerry."
"susan"," Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you 
              my baby"
"george"," Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey."
"jerry"," Well. Well."
"susan"," Hi, Jerry."
"jerry"," Hey, Susan, George. "
"susan"," You know, I really like Sheila a lot."
"jerry"," Oh, really?"
"susan"," Mmm-hmm."
"jerry"," Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore."
"susan"," Oh, no! That's too bad."
"jerry"," Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You 
              know I"
"george"," Really?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which 
              you"
"susan"," Mmm-hmm."
"george"," You did?"
"jerry"," Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya."
"george"," Yeah. See ya."
"elaine"," Hello."
"elaine"," I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "" 5 cups 
              chopped Porcine"
"elaine"," Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn 
              and crab"
"elaine"," You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for 
              you. Next!"
"newman","  Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!"
"jerry"," What is it?"
"newman"," Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!"
"jerry"," Wha - wha - what's the matter?"
"newman"," Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow 
              she got"
"jerry"," Well, where are you going?"
"newman"," He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a 
              big pot!"
"susan"," Hey, I 
              gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM."
"george"," Yeah, 
              I better grab some too."
"susan"," I'll get 
              it for you; just give me your card."
"george"," You sure?"
"susan"," Yeah, just 
              tell me your code."
"george"," My code?"
"jerry"," So why 
              didn't you tell her the code?"
"george"," No. No 
              way."
"jerry"," George, 
              you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely."
"george"," It says 
              very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret"
"jerry"," So you're 
              taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?"
"george"," Why does 
              everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't"
"jerry"," Actually, 
              that's the definition of selfish."
"george"," Have you 
              ever given your code to anyone?"
"jerry"," No one's 
              ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'"
"george"," Superman's 
              father on Krypton."
"jerry"," Of course. 
              C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up"
"george"," No. I 
              am not giving my code to anyone for any reason."
"jerry"," What if 
              my life depended on it?"
"george"," If you're 
              in some situation where some fast cash will save your life,"
"george"," What's 
              the matter with your leg?"
"jerry"," My foot 
              fell asleep."
"george"," How'd 
              your foot fall asleep?"
"jerry"," I crossed 
              my legs, I forgot to alternate."
"jerry"," Hey Fred."
"george"," Hey Fred."
"jerry"," My foot 
              fell asleep."
"jerry"," Fred, do 
              you know Elaine?"
"george"," Alright, 
              bye."
"jerry"," Seeya."
"elaine"," Did you 
              hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'"
"jerry"," So?"
"elaine"," So? We've 
              met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten"
"jerry"," And he 
              didn't remember you?"
"jerry"," Where are 
              you going, you just got here?"
"elaine"," I gotta 
              go talk to him."
"elaine"," Excuse 
              me, excuse me, Fred?"
"elaine"," You just 
              said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before."
"elaine"," Yeah, 
              at Katie Ash's party?"
"elaine"," Elaine. 
              You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my"
"elaine"," When my 
              uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at"
"elaine"," That was 
              right when we were in front of the bathroom door."
"jerry"," Hey that 
              sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should"
"jerry"," Uh huh, 
              okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do"
"kramer"," Leapin' 
              Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this."
"jerry"," What is 
              that?"
"kramer"," Well, 
              it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires,"
"jerry"," Yeah, those 
              civil servants who risk their lives really got it made."
"kramer"," When I 
              was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that"
"jerry"," You're 
              lucky they let you drive a car."
"kramer"," No no 
              no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day"
"elaine"," What was 
              that?"
"jerry","  Eh."
"elaine"," Alright. 
              So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers"
"jerry"," Really? 
              I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women."
"elaine"," What are 
              you saying?"
"jerry"," Well, what's 
              to be said? He didn't remember you."
"elaine"," Yeah, 
              but why? I mean, ya know."
"jerry"," I know."
"elaine"," Ya know?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I 
              know."
"elaine"," Huh, lookit, 
              you got the new catalog."
"jerry"," Yeah, you 
              wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe."
"elaine"," Too good. 
              Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to"
"jerry"," Why would 
              I wanna do that?"
"elaine"," Oh please, 
              Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells"
"jerry"," Yeah, sounds 
              like fun."
"susan"," I want 
              you to tell me, George."
"george"," Why? Why 
              is my code so important?"
"susan"," Because, 
              it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. "
"george"," Well I'm 
              sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about"
"susan"," My cycles?"
"george"," Yeah, 
              I never know what's going on there."
"susan"," Well from 
              now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles."
"george"," Please."
"susan"," Anything 
              else?"
"george"," We're 
              out of Bosco!"
"jerry"," Howbout

"jerry"," No I don't."
"jerry"," You know 
              what? I'll be with you in a minute."
"jerry"," Larry, 
              wait, you don't understand!"
"kramer"," I just 
              came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is"
"jerry"," I didn't 
              do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep."
"kramer"," Oh, oh 
              your foot fell asleep."
"jerry"," Ya know, 
              the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,"
"kramer"," Well, 
              you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you,"
"jerry"," Yup."
"kramer"," Boy, look 
              at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday."
"jerry"," Wow, the 
              whole building burned down."
"kramer"," They just 
              don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got"
"jerry"," Of course."
"kramer"," It's all 
              up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate."
"jerry"," The amazing 
              thing is you never have any place to go."
"george"," Where 
              we gonna eat?"
"jerry"," We're gonna 
              meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place."
"george"," Peterman? 
              Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman."
"jerry"," Of course 
              not, if I did would you have gone?"
"george"," No way."
"jerry"," There you 
              go."
"george"," I don't 
              even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna"
"jerry"," Trust me, 
              you're off."
"elaine"," Oh, hi 
              Fred."
"elaine"," It's Elaine."
"elaine"," How ya 
              doin'?"
"elaine"," Yeah, 
              that's too bad."
"elaine"," Hmm. I 
              never take them."
"elaine"," Yeah! 
              Yeah, that's right, you remembered!"
"elaine"," Hmm. Tonight."
"elaine"," No, no 
              no no, none that I can, um, remember."
"jerry"," ...Alright, 
              you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. "
"george"," Call the 
              Embassy."
"jerry"," They're 
              closed."
"george"," Why?"
"jerry"," Bomb threat."
"george"," We're 
              in Turkey?"
"jerry"," Midnight 
              Express, my friend."
"george"," My card 
              won't work there; they're not on the Plus system."
"jerry"," Yes, hi, 
              Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza."
"jerry"," Well, is 
              Elaine here?"
"george"," What's 
              going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?"
"jerry"," Without 
              Elaine? What for?"
"george"," What, 
              is he crazy?"
"jerry"," We gotta 
              get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man."
"george"," I've got 
              nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank."
"jerry"," George, 
              what's the matter with you?"
"george"," I'm choking!"
"jerry"," Actually, 
              you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that"
"george"," Howbout 
              sports? Do you follow sports?"
"george"," You know, 
              this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really."
"jerry"," I can't 
              believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor."
"elaine"," Well, 
              Fred asked me out."
"jerry"," Fred?"
"elaine"," Yeah, 
              and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy."
"jerry"," You see 
              what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't"
"elaine"," I am? 
              But that's so sick."
"jerry"," That's 
              God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together."
"elaine"," Anyway, 
              so how was the dinner?"
"jerry"," Well, when 
              I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the"
"elaine"," What about 
              Georgie?"
"jerry"," Nah, he 
              didn't make it."
"george"," I'm, uh, 
              George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son."
"george"," Yeah. 
              What time is it?"
"george"," Who?"
"george"," Hi. I-I 
              really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh,"
"george"," Oh, shhh."
"george"," Shut up! 
              Shut up!"
"george"," You know 
              this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't"
"jerry"," I did not 
              bail out on you. "
"george"," Well why 
              couldn't you include me in your excuse?"
"jerry"," Why didn't 
              you come up with your own?"
"george"," I froze. 
              I think I'm losing it."
"jerry"," Ah, c'mon. 
              Maybe you're just in a slump?"
"george"," No, no. 
              I reached down and there was *nothing* there."
"george"," Now Peterman 
              wants me to go to the funeral."
"jerry"," Oh, come 
              on, just tell me your code already. What is it?"
"george"," I am not 
              giving you my code."
"kramer"," I'll bet 
              I can guess it."
"george"," Pssh. 
              Yeah. Right."
"kramer"," Oh, alright. 
              Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out"
"george"," Huh?"
"kramer"," You're 
              a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your"
"george"," Get out 
              of here."
"kramer"," Oh you 
              may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the"
"george"," I'm leaving."
"george"," I gotta 
              go."
"kramer"," If you 
              could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!"
"george"," Shut up!"
"kramer"," Nestl's 
              Quik!"
"george"," Shut up!"
"george"," What was 
              that?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," You just 
              checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?"
"elaine"," I got 
              a date."
"elaine"," Oh, Mr. 
              Peterman."
"george"," Mothers 
              say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy"
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman, 
              you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've"
"george"," Uh, yes, 
              actually we-we both do."
"elaine"," I have 
              a personal commitment."
"george"," Well, 
              personal, I mean, we both uh..."
"elaine"," I'm speaking 
              at a women's' rights conference."
"george"," Yes, and 
              I'm speaking at a men's' conference."
"elaine"," My pleasure."
"kramer"," Hey, you 
              wanna come down the fire station with me?"
"jerry"," Fire station?"
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world! "
"jerry"," Nah, I 
              gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's."
"kramer"," Oh, so 
              he took you back."
"jerry"," Yeah, we 
              straightened it out, all is forgiven."
"kramer"," Well, 
              you know the important thing is that you learned something."
"jerry"," No I didn't."
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the"
"jerry"," Anyway, 
              thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding."
"jerry"," Oh sure. 
              "
"jerry"," Uh, again? 
               I'll be right there. "
"kramer"," Leapin' 
              Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam."
"kramer"," Are you 
              ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?"
"kramer"," Well, 
              you'd better take it easy."
"elaine"," Huh."
"kramer"," It's Kramer!"
"kramer"," DeSoto's 
              down, but Cosmo's got the caboose."
"jerry"," Beats me."
"kramer"," Don't 
              worry, Cap, I can handle it!"
"jerry"," Kramer?"
"jerry"," Ah, that's 
              a shame."
"george"," I don't 
              have my ATM card."
"george"," What?! 
              Why?"
"george"," But I-I-I-"
"susan"," Hi. Here's 
              your cash, George. "
"george"," Hm. Thanks."
"susan"," And here's 
              your card back. Anyone for Bosco?"
"jerry"," Oh my god. 
              Look at this."
"george"," Hm?"
"george"," The Rogue's 
              Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little"
"kramer"," Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS 
        walk."
"elaine"," Is that tomorrow?"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...&lt;gestures to Elaine to sign the 
        form.&gt;"
"kramer"," Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with 
        myself."
"kramer"," I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they 
        think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the 
        walk, baby. &lt;gets up&gt; I'll be right back."
"elaine"," New jeans?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Still a 31 waist?"
"jerry"," Yep. Since college. &lt;Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.&gt; 
        Hey, Lena Small's on this list."
"elaine"," Lena Small?"
"jerry"," Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and 
        now here's her number."
"elaine"," Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity 
        list!"
"elaine"," You're a taking person."
"jerry"," That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, 
        everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam."
"jerry"," Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to 
        me."
"elaine"," What's he look like?"
"jerry"," I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying 
        a speedboat."
"elaine"," You're buying a speedboat?"
"jerry"," See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. &lt;Elaine 
        laughs.&gt; All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home 
        free."
"elaine"," I don't know about that."
"jerry"," So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you 
        wouldn't have gone out with him?"
"elaine"," Well..."
"jerry"," Yeah. So you really like this guy."
"elaine"," Very much."
"jerry"," How's the...sexual chemistry?"
"elaine"," Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping 
        today. &lt;Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.&gt;"
"kramer"," Are you still on the pill?"
"elaine"," Uh, Kramer..."
"kramer"," I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an 
        open forum. "
"elaine"," The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge."
"kramer"," But wasn't that taken off the market?"
"elaine"," Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves 
        the sponge."
"kramer"," I read it in <i>Wall Street Week</i>...Louis, uh, Rukeyser."
"jerry"," Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? 
        I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. 
        Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, 
        I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
"susan"," You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's 
        really thin."
"george"," Not as thin as you think."
"susan"," Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back."
"george"," The tag, huh?"
"susan"," Mmm-hmm."
"george"," Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's 
        just leave it at that."
"susan"," What are you talking about?"
"george"," He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31."
"susan"," Oh, how could he be so vain?"
"george"," Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe 
        I just told you that."
"george"," Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
"susan"," Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell 
        me everything."
"george"," Where did you get that from?"
"susan"," Well, we're a couple. It's understood."
"george"," I never heard of that."
"susan"," Well, you've never been a couple."
"george"," I've coupled! I've coupled! "
"susan"," Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code."
"george"," This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's 
        secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it 
        by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the 
        loop!"
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. What's the matter?"
"george"," I had a fight with Susan."
"jerry"," What about?"
"george"," Oh...&lt;is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders&gt; ...clothing, 
        something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?"
"jerry"," I got a date with that girl, Lena."
"george"," Lena, how'd you meet her?"
"jerry"," I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... &lt;Jerry stops, and 
        mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number 
        from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica 
        on the phone at work.&gt;"
"george"," You met her a few weeks ago, but...?"
"george"," So, uh...wanna double?"
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic."
"jerry"," I dunno. &lt;Elaine enters.&gt; Hey."
"elaine"," Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off 
        the market."
"jerry"," So what are you gonna do?"
"elaine"," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target 
        search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store 
        in a 25-block radius."
"george"," Just for these sponges?"
"elaine"," Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. 
        What does Susan use?"
"george"," I dunno."
"elaine"," You don't know?"
"george"," I, uh...figure it's something. &lt;Kramer enters.&gt;"
"jerry"," What are you all out of breath from?"
"jerry"," And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, 
        you're in horrible shape."
"kramer"," Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!"
"jerry"," I got a 31 waist, mister!"
"kramer"," Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
"elaine"," Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three."
"elaine"," Make it ten."
"elaine"," Twenty sponges should be plenty."
"elaine"," Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine."
"elaine"," Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way."
"jerry"," Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my 
        shirt."
"jerry"," It's All-Tempa-Cheer."
"george"," Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy."
"jerry"," They serve soup at 6 a.m.? "
"jerry"," Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?"""
"george"," I'd get tired of it."
"jerry"," How could you not?"
"george"," Mick Jagger."
"susan"," Oh, the poet!"
"jerry"," Is it a lot of cream soups?"
"susan"," Maya Angelou, the poet."
"george"," Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does 
        a poet need an unlisted number for?"
"susan"," I'm going to the ladies room."
"george"," What are you looking at me like that for?"
"jerry"," Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?"
"george"," What are you talking about?"
"jerry"," Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan."
"susan"," Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's 
        awful!"
"george"," I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell 
        you."
"susan"," But you told me anyway?"
"george"," Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're 
        right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then 
        I'm gonna go by the rule."
"susan"," Thank you, honey."
"george"," So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?"
"susan"," Can we stop by a drug store first?"
"george"," What for?"
"susan"," I'm out of birth control stuff."
"george"," Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? &lt;Pulls over.&gt;"
"susan"," Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in."
"george"," Me run in? Why don't you run in?"
"susan"," You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?"
"george"," Of course I do."
"susan"," You do? What?"
"george"," You know. You use the, uh...&lt;mutters something unintelligible 
        under his breath.&gt;"
"susan"," The what?"
"george"," You know, the uh...&lt;mutters it again.&gt;"
"susan"," Just get me some sponges, please."
"george"," Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found 
        out, they just took them off the market."
"susan"," Off the market? The sponge?"
"george"," Yeah, so you gotta use something else."
"susan"," I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!"
"george"," O.k....&lt;thinks&gt; I think I know where we can get one."
"jerry"," Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?"
"kramer"," It's a poker game...&lt;yells to the crowd&gt; And I'm kickin' 
        some serious butt!"
"jerry"," Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!"
"kramer"," Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? 
        Do they look scared?! "
"jerry"," You're never gonna make it!"
"elaine"," O.k. Hold on just a second. &lt;Gets up and heads to the bathroom. 
        George knocks at the door.&gt;"
"george"," Elaine? It's me, George. &lt;Elaine opens the door.&gt; Hey, 
        sorry to bother you so late. &lt;To Billy&gt; Hey! How ya doin.' &lt;To 
        Elaine&gt; Uh, did you get any of those sponges?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?"
"george"," Well...Susan."
"elaine"," Ah, Susan uses the sponge."
"george"," Susan loves the sponge."
"elaine"," Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out."
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," I can't do it. No way, there's no how. &lt;Tries to push George 
        out the door. George resists.&gt;"
"george"," Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not 
        just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know 
        about make-up sex?"
"elaine"," Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. 
        &lt;Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks 
        the door with his foot.&gt;"
"george"," Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? 
        Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between 
        you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is 
        all that I have left."
"elaine"," I'm <i>sure</i> you'll have another fight, George. &lt;Stamps 
        on George's foot and closes the door.&gt;  Hold that thought! 
      "
"susan"," So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He 
        got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list."
"jerry"," How'd you find out?"
"jerry"," George!"
"jerry"," Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just - "
"jerry"," You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?"
"kramer"," Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants 
        on!"
"jerry"," You went all night?"
"jerry"," Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, 
        three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
"kramer"," AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. &lt;George enters.&gt; Hey!"
"jerry"," So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number."
"george"," Really? How'd she do that?"
"jerry"," A friend of a friend of Susan's."
"george"," My Susan?"
"jerry"," Why'd you tell her?!"
"george"," Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other 
        everything!"
"jerry"," Well you know what this means, don't you? "
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
"george"," You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!"
"jerry"," You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!"
"george"," C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again."
"jerry"," If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed 
        someone?"
"george"," Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story."
"jerry"," I don't know, George."
"george"," So, Lena was upset, huh?"
"jerry"," You know what? That was the amazing thing. "
"george"," What, it didn't bother her?"
"jerry"," No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about 
        this girl."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," She's too good."
"george"," Too good..."
"jerry"," I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about 
        the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!"
"george"," I see what you mean."
"jerry"," I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with 
        someone you admire."
"george"," Where's the depravity?"
"jerry"," No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even 
        has sex. "
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," Hey, I didn't even use one. "
"jerry"," I thought you said it was imminent."
"elaine"," Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really 
        sponge-worthy."
"jerry"," Sponge-worthy?"
"elaine"," Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
"jerry"," But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
"elaine"," Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've 
        got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste 
        any of 'em."
"george"," You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!"
"kramer"," Uh, no thanks."
"kramer"," No."
"kramer"," I have to?"
"kramer"," See, that's why I don't want to. "
"kramer"," You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. &lt;Walks away.&gt;"
"george"," Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of 
        them."
"susan"," Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms."
"george"," Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got 
        engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever."
"susan"," Just once...for the make-up sex."
"george"," Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're 
        way past that."
"susan"," Come on, just once?"
"george"," No, no...I hate the condom."
"susan"," Why?"
"george"," I can never get the package open in time."
"susan"," Well, you just tear it open."
"george"," It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's 
        a lot of pressure there."
"kramer"," Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just 
        don't wear the ribbon."
"elaine"," So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
"elaine"," Run down your case for me again...?"
"elaine"," You going to do something about your sideburns?"
"elaine"," And the bathroom in your apartment?"
"elaine"," The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?"
"elaine"," Alright, let's go. &lt;They head for the bedroom.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hi."
"jerry"," Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric 
        group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're 
        free to go at anytime."
"jerry"," Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you 
        about something...you know, because you're such a good person - "
"jerry"," Oh, o.k. &lt;Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens 
        of boxes of Today sponges.&gt; "
"jerry"," What? Nothing."
"jerry"," Oh..."
"jerry"," Tell you something...I do."
"jerry"," Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing? "
"jerry"," I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, 
        you know. That's it. &lt;Lena is puzzled.&gt;"
"susan"," Come on, George, just tear it open."
"george"," I'm trying, dammit. "
"susan"," Tear it."
"george"," I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. 
        You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
"susan"," Here give it to me."
"george"," Would you wait a second? Just wait? &lt;They fight over it.&gt;"
"susan"," Give it to me. &lt;She rips it open.&gt; Come on. Come on!"
"kramer"," This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to 
        wear!"
"jerry"," It completely turned her off."
"george"," Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares 
        about your pants size?"
"jerry"," I don't wanna be a 32."
"george"," I'd kill to be a 32."
"jerry"," She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!"
"george"," That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers 
        on those things so hard to open?"
"jerry"," It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind."
"george"," You never run out, do you? &lt;Jerry smiles.&gt; Where's Kramer? 
        Everything's finished here."
"jerry"," Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my 
        god...Kramer?"
"jerry"," Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. 
        &lt;Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks 
        at Kramer.&gt;"
"george"," Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?"
"elaine"," Yep. "
"elaine"," Nope. &lt;Billy leans in to kiss her.&gt; What are you doing?"
"elaine"," Oh...I don't think so."
"elaine"," I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. &lt;Pats 
        Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.&gt;"
"jerry","  I think gum is, is one of the weirdest 
        human"
"george"," You think she's happy?"
"jerry"," Who?"
"george","  The cashier."
"jerry"," Ruthie Cohen?"
"george","  You know her name?"
"jerry"," Sure."
"george"," I don't think I've ever spoken to her."
"jerry"," Maybe that's why she's happy."
"kramer","  Good morning, gentlemen."
"jerry"," What is this?"
"kramer","  Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from 
        the Alex"
"jerry"," That stinky old movie-house?"
"kramer","  Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up 
        the"
"george","  With Spartacus?"
"kramer","  Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps 
        as his"
"jerry"," Geoffrey who?"
"kramer"," Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. 
        Some"
"george"," Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch 
        on TV?"
"kramer"," Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something 
        in"
"george"," Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?"
"kramer"," Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, 
        get the"
"jerry"," I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign."
"kramer"," Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? 
        Had to"
"george"," Really?"
"kramer"," Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my 
        wing."
"jerry"," Oh, then I'm not worried."
"kramer"," But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here 
        treat him"
"george","  Breakdown, huh?"
"kramer"," Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. "
"kramer","  Sit down. "
"jerry"," Lloyd."
"george"," Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?"
"kramer"," Yeah well, he's doing fine, George."
"jerry","  That's an interesting package."
"kramer"," Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious 
        it is. (he"
"george"," I don't chew gum."
"jerry","  Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?"
"jerry"," Nah, don't bother."
"jerry"," I don't want it."
"kramer"," Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating 
        the"
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm."
"george"," You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change."
"elaine"," Hey."
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. 
        It's a"
"elaine"," What kind is that?"
"jerry"," It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me."
"elaine"," Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?"
"george","  After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete"
"elaine"," You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. 
        Y... you"
"jerry"," You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently"
"elaine"," Yeah? Well, I got news for you."
"george"," The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my 
        mother"
"jerry"," And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you."
"george"," Right, gotta get going."
"jerry"," Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?"
"george"," Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
"jerry"," I thought your parents were outta town?"
"george"," Why d'you think I'm going now?"
"george"," Hey, Mr Lazzari."
"george"," Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks."
"george"," Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight."
"george"," Something like that."
"george"," Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars."
"george"," Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug.  Oh my gosh, you 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
        look as"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?"
"kramer"," The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden 
        era of"
"elaine"," Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?"
"kramer"," Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark"
"jerry"," Oh, can Lloyd really do that?"
"kramer"," Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. 
        (to"
"elaine","  What? Lloyd is here?"
"elaine"," What? No, no, I'd rather..."
"elaine","  Lloyd, yes. Hello."
"elaine","  Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have 
        to sit"
"kramer","  You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just 
        forgot"
"jerry"," We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the 
        special"
"elaine"," I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him 
        on again."
"jerry"," Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable."
"george"," I know. Completely bonkers!"
"george"," Pop? What happened to Pop?"
"george","  He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?"
"george","  Uhm, I, I gotta go."
"george"," I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. 
        Pop."
"george"," Pop! POP!!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," I don't know what I was thinking."
"jerry","  Errh."
"kramer","  Ah, he loved it."
"elaine"," Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, 
        in the"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired."
"elaine"," Oh. Oh God."
"elaine"," Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out 
        in a hot"
"elaine"," Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always 
        be using a"
"kramer"," Yeah, put these glasses on."
"jerry","  Well, what's this for?"
"kramer"," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
"jerry"," So what?"
"kramer"," Well, he thinks you wear those."
"kramer"," They're from the lost and found at the Alex."
"jerry"," Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these 
        on."
"kramer"," Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit 
        with him on"
"george"," 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe 
        I paid you"
"george"," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on 
        the bill"
"george"," Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum."
"george"," I don't."
"george"," I know I gave it to you."
"george","  Fine. Fine.  Excuse me. "
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
"jerry"," Ah, Lloyd."
"jerry","  Oh, the gum."
"kramer"," Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?"
"jerry","  Uh, alright. "
"kramer"," Oh, boy."
"kramer"," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, 
        sitting"
"jerry"," Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish"
"jerry"," 's not necessary."
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour."
"jerry"," I know that, Kramer."
"kramer"," No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, 
        he"
"jerry"," Yes I do, Kramer."
"kramer"," Yeah?"
"kramer"," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
"jerry"," I didn't see anything."
"kramer"," Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,"
"george"," Well, you know.  It's understandable."
"george"," Warning signs?"
"george","  What?  Wh... what're you talking about? I'm 
        not the"
"george"," All my friends do that."
"george"," You see that woman on the horse? "
"george"," She stole twenty dollars from me.  Yeah, I might've"
"george","  Hey! Hey, you!  Come 
        back"
"jerry"," So you say she was on a horse?"
"george"," I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
"jerry"," Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. 
        See if"
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue."
"elaine","  What?"
"jerry"," I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about 
        the"
"elaine","  Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was 
        wide open."
"jerry"," Maybe it's in the lost and found."
"elaine"," Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button 
        too,"
"jerry"," You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you 
        ate it."
"kramer"," Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you 
        back at"
"kramer"," Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?"
"kramer"," Brown?"
"kramer"," Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll 
        turn up"
"george","  Alright. Alright."
"george","  Hang on, it's warming up!"
"george","  Oh you mother..."
"george"," Hey! What is your problem?"
"george"," Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left 
        on that"
"george"," Aah! Fire!"
"george","  Fire!!"
"george"," Your hose! Where's your hose?!"
"kramer"," Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?"
"george"," The Jon Voight car is no more."
"kramer"," Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you 
        want to."
"george"," No kidding?"
"kramer"," No kidding."
"george"," Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one."
"kramer"," Yeah, merry Christmas."
"george","  Whatever."
"jerry"," Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?"
"kramer"," What, he's not here yet?"
"jerry"," Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!"
"kramer"," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses."
"jerry"," Why?"
"kramer"," They're Geoffrey Haarwood's."
"kramer","  Here, try this pair."
"jerry"," Aw, these are really strong glasses."
"jerry","  Yeah, yeah."
"kramer","  Oh yeah, he's all ready to go."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check 
        out"
"jerry"," Absolutely. Let's just stick around."
"kramer"," Uh, yeah."
"kramer"," Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?"
"kramer"," No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing 
        wrong"
"kramer"," No, no, no, no. I'll show you.  
        One"
"kramer"," Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?"
"kramer"," Yeah, here we go, yeah.  Mmm, oh. That's 
        delicious."
"kramer"," Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy.  
        I"
"elaine"," Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?"
"elaine"," Well, uhm... I..."
"elaine"," Uh... I..."
"elaine"," No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!"
"elaine"," Hey. Hey everybody."
"jerry"," Lloyd?"
"jerry"," Lloyd?"
"elaine","  What is Lloyd's problem?"
"kramer"," Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, 
        but this"
"elaine"," Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose."
"kramer"," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not 
        one of your"
"george"," You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what 
        he did"
"george"," No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier."
"george"," You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot."
"george"," No, she wasn't on the horse."
"george"," That's right."
"george","  And him!"
"george"," Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a 
        little"
"george"," I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld."
"george"," Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls 
        to"
"george"," Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!"
"george"," Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're..."
"george"," Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses."
"george"," I know. Don't you see.  He was doing it to fool Lloyd 
        Braun!"
"jerry"," Alright."
"jerry","  Here."
"george"," Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is 
        just a"
"george"," Believe me, I am not crazy."
"jerry","  Got all this?"
"jerry","  I gave you a hundred dollars?!"
"jerry"," It's a lotta gum!"
"kramer"," Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses."
"kramer"," Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W."
"kramer"," Is that from Henry the Eighth?"
"kramer"," Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do 
        you think"
"kramer","  You don't say."
"kramer"," You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna 
        be so"
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick."
"kramer"," Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing."
"george","  Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait 
        a minute,"
"george","  Can I get a pack of gum, please?"
"george"," What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that?  
        I guess"
"george"," No, no. Deena, it's not what you think."
"george"," Th... this isn't mine."
"george"," I got it from the Institute. The Institute."
"george","  Dee... Deena!"
"kramer"," Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a 
        premiere."
"kramer"," Oh, he ran away."
"kramer"," I need to talk to you."
"elaine"," You know, that button looks very familiar."
"elaine"," I, I think that's my button.  You know, 
        I've"
"elaine"," Shall I undo it?"
"elaine"," Oh, thank you."
"elaine"," Oh.  Tickle, tickle."
"kramer"," Oh, tell me about it."
"elaine","  I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. 
              Wow! He's so "
"elaine"," Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific."
"jerry"," Maybe he'll write a song about you."
"elaine"," Yeah. Right.  Like that really matters."
"jerry"," So I take it he's spongeworthy?"
"elaine"," Oh, yeah."
"jerry"," Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, 
              you know, "
"elaine"," Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all. "
"jerry"," Oh, no?"
"elaine"," Yeah. In fact, he...."
"jerry"," Come on. Come on."
"elaine"," I don't wanna!"
"jerry"," Elaine, you're among friends."
"elaine","  Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to 
              do..."
"jerry"," Oh."
"elaine"," Yeah. It's surprising."
"jerry"," Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?"
"elaine"," No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. 
              I'm not gonna "
"jerry"," Sure. Why not? You're there."
"elaine"," Exactly."
"jerry"," But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. 
            "
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help 
              me get my "
"jerry"," What stuff?"
"kramer"," I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby."
"jerry"," All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. 
              What did you "
"kramer"," Course I will. These are staples."
"jerry"," A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?"
"kramer"," Lindsay olives, Jerry."
"jerry"," A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue 
              sauce? Ten "
"kramer"," $17.50. You can't beat that."
"jerry"," Look...look at this can of tuna!"
"kramer"," Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut."
"jerry"," This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3."
"kramer"," Hey, Clyde!"
"kramer"," Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here. "
"jerry"," Hi."
"kramer"," You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine."
"jerry"," John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about 
              him upstairs"
"jerry"," Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're 
              pretty hot "
"kramer"," Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of 
              this stuff "
"george"," Yeah. Yeah, one second."
"george"," All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's 
              not make "
"george"," My in-laws. Oh, my...."
"george"," I think he should wear whatever tie he wants."
"george"," This is gonna be fun."
"jerry"," Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. 
              He's in "
"elaine"," So what did he have to say?"
"jerry"," Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy."
"elaine"," Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," What did you do that for?"
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think 
              that "
"jerry"," Oh"
"elaine"," I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me 
              here. I don't "
"jerry"," Well, Clyde might not tell him."
"elaine"," How do you know that?"
"jerry"," I should have helped Kramer with those packages."
"elaine"," Ohh!"
"kramer"," Uh-huh."
"kramer"," Yeah. Sure. Sure."
"kramer"," Drive the horse?"
"kramer"," Oh, giddyup. Yeah."
"george"," This is delicious, Mrs. Ross."
"george"," It's, uh, it's not a little chicken.  Little 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              chicken. It's "
"george"," Yeah."
"susan"," More wine anyone? "
"susan"," Hmmm?"
"susan"," How do you like the Merlot?"
"george"," She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot. "
"george"," Why don't we talk about it another time."
"george"," Did anybody see Firestorm?"
"george"," Yeah."
"george"," Oh mother of God."
"kramer"," Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed 
              in 1850 by "
"george"," Thank God that's over."
"george"," So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal."
"george"," What is this? The marble rye?"
"susan"," I don't know. Where'd you put it?"
"susan"," Well, it's gone."
"george"," You stole the bread?"
"george"," Because we brought it for them!"
"susan"," Who would bring a bread and take it back?"
"george"," Maybe they forgot to put it out!"
"jerry"," He stole back the rye?"
"george"," Yeah. "
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why. "
"jerry"," So, do the Ross's know?"
"george"," I don't know. They're all very suspicious."
"jerry"," Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear."
"george"," Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them 
              all "
"jerry"," Bad situation. "
"george"," I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace 
              that rye."
"jerry"," What do you mean replace it?"
"george"," You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it 
              would have "
"jerry"," Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?"
"george"," What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it 
              in there? I"
"jerry"," All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about 
              it. Get the "
"george"," So?"
"jerry"," Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while."
"george"," And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them 
              for a"
"jerry"," Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about 
              the clip clop, "
"george"," So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back 
              the bread is "
"jerry"," What about Susan?"
"george"," She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to 
              have dinner "
"jerry"," Beautiful!"
"george"," You think Kramer'll do it?"
"kramer"," Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta 
              do is be there "
"george"," Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half 
              an hour."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," What the hell are you doing there?"
"kramer"," It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?"
"jerry"," No. No thanks."
"kramer"," Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I 
              don't have any "
"george"," Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the 
              rye bread "
"jerry"," Just put it under your shirt."
"george"," Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge! "
"jerry"," I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, 
              I'll "

"elaine"," Hey!"
"susan"," A little baby girl?"

"george"," Yeah, that's right. It's working."
"george"," I solve problems. That's just what I do."
"kramer","  Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
"jerry"," You're really going to town with that turkey there."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
"kramer"," Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."

"kramer","  What, this yellow stuff? 
      "
"kramer"," Ah, 's no good."
"kramer"," No. That's bush league."
"jerry"," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? "

"jerry","  Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there 
      "
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. What's with your neck?"
"elaine"," Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. "
"jerry"," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
"elaine","  Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
"jerry"," Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
"elaine"," Ach, maybe."
"jerry"," Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it."
"elaine"," I don't know."
"jerry"," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned 
      "
"elaine","  You know what, why don't you just shut the 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
"
"jerry"," Awright."
"elaine"," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike 
      "
"kramer"," Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
"kramer"," Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
"kramer"," Alright, lean forward, relax."
"elaine","  What? What?"
"kramer"," Encounter shiatsu."
"elaine"," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
"kramer","  Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the 
      "
"elaine"," Ah hah."
"kramer","  He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre."
"elaine","  Wha...?"
"kramer"," He's a genius. Here we go..."
"kramer"," From pain, will come pleasure."
"kramer"," Uh? Voila."
"elaine","  Oh my god!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!"
"jerry"," What's even more amazing is his formal training is in "
"kramer"," Awright, my work is done here."
"elaine","  Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
"kramer","  Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
"elaine","  What?  What, what is he talking about?"
"jerry"," I dunno.  Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
"elaine"," You really think he wants the bike?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"elaine"," It took him like ten seconds!"
"jerry"," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
"george"," I think they really went for that Soda."
"susan"," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
"george"," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
"susan"," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
"george"," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
"susan"," Yeah."
"susan"," What is that? Sign language?"
"george"," No, Seven."
"susan"," Seven Costanza? You're serious?"
"george"," Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl..."
"george"," ...especially a girl. Or a boy."
"susan"," I don't think so."
"george"," What, you don't like the name?"
"susan"," It's not a name. It's a number."
"george"," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
"susan"," It's awful. I hate it!"
"george","  Well, that's the name!"
"susan","  Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
"george","  Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
"jerry"," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
"george","  Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
"jerry"," Awright, let's see. How about Mug?  Mug "
"george"," Alright, you having a good time there?"
"jerry"," I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? "
"george","  Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
"jerry"," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
"george"," Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?"
"jerry"," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
"george"," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
"jerry","  I'm not engaged."
"kramer"," Ah, I got it."
"jerry"," Got what?"
"kramer","  Got the answer, Jerry. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
"kramer"," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
"kramer"," Here. I write it down.  ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
"jerry"," Sort of a mooching inventory."
"kramer"," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
"jerry"," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
"kramer"," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
"kramer","  Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
"jerry"," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
"george"," The same outfit?"
"jerry"," The exact same outfit."
"george"," How many days was it between encounters."
"jerry"," Three."
"george"," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
"jerry"," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
"george"," Maybe she moved it up in the rotation."
"jerry"," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
"george"," Very curious."
"jerry"," Indeed."
"george"," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
"jerry"," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
"george","  Awright, I'm heading home."
"jerry"," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
"george","  Not yet, but she's weakening."
"jerry"," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
"george"," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
"jerry"," How about 'Mickey'?"
"george"," 'Mickey'?  'Mickey'!"
"kramer"," Hey buddy."
"jerry","  Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
"kramer"," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
"jerry"," You cannot buy half a can of soda."
"kramer"," Well, why not."
"jerry"," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
"jerry"," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
"kramer"," Alright."
"jerry"," ...You bite it, you bought it."
"kramer"," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Oh.  So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
"elaine"," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
"kramer","  It's a verbal contract. We had a deal."
"elaine"," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
"kramer"," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
"elaine"," This is not the point.  The point is, you just can't 
      "
"kramer"," Boy, I am really surprised at you.  You are 
      "
"kramer"," I always put you up here..."
"kramer"," ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww."
"elaine","  Alright."
"kramer","  Digidi."
"george"," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
"susan"," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
"george"," Why not?"
"susan"," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
"george"," So, what're you saying?"
"susan"," They're gonna name their baby Seven."
"george","  What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
"susan"," I can't believe that they're using it."
"george","  Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
"susan"," I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with."
"george","  Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
"elaine","  Oh god! Oh, god.  Kramer!"
"elaine","  Oh, ah.  Stupid Kramer."
"elaine"," Huh?"
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
"elaine","  I'm fine."
"elaine","  Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
"kramer"," You got that right!"
"elaine","  Kramer! Kramer!"
"george"," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
"elaine"," Kramer!!"
"jerry"," Hey"
"elaine"," Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?"
"jerry"," Haven't seen him. How's the neck?"
"elaine"," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
"jerry"," Boy, I'm surprised.  I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
"elaine"," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
"jerry"," You saw her? What was she wearing?"
"elaine"," I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of 
      "
"jerry"," Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?"
"elaine"," What d'you care?"
"jerry"," Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress."
"elaine"," Did you have a nice ride?"
"kramer"," Oh, great ride."
"elaine"," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
"kramer"," What're you talking about?! We had a deal!"
"elaine","  You better give me back that bike!  
      "
"kramer"," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
"elaine"," What? You never told me that."
"kramer"," Well, it's common sense."
"elaine"," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
"kramer"," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
"elaine"," Yeah Jerry."
"jerry"," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
"elaine"," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
"kramer"," Alright, I'm down."
"jerry"," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
"elaine"," So, that's the situation."
"newman"," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
"kramer"," Newman!"
"newman"," ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, 
        no "
"kramer"," Uh, yeah."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"newman"," Alright, let's begin."
"newman","  Ooh, my cocoa!"
"george"," It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it."
"george"," Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't

"george","  What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
"george"," You don't care for Soda?!"
"george","  How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's "
"george"," What about Six?"
"george"," Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good."
"george"," Fourteen.  Fourteen!"
"jerry"," No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure you do."
"jerry"," Oh."
"jerry"," Change?  Yes, I think that's a super idea."
"george","  You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow 
      "
"george","  It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
"george","  So am I!"
"newman"," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
"newman"," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "
"newman"," ...But I have made a decision.  We will cut the "
"elaine","  What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!"
"elaine"," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead.  Cut the stupid thing 
      "
"kramer"," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
"newman"," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
"elaine"," What?!"
"kramer"," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
"elaine","  But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
"kramer"," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."

"george"," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
"susan"," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
"george"," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
"susan"," Yeah."
"susan"," What is that? Sign language?"
"george"," No, Seven."
"susan"," Seven Costanza? You're serious?"
"george"," Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl..."
"george"," ...especially a girl. Or a boy."
"susan"," I don't think so."
"george"," What, you don't like the name?"
"susan"," It's not a name. It's a number."
"george"," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
"susan"," It's awful. I hate it!"
"george","  Well, that's the name!"
"susan","  Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
"george","  Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
"jerry"," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
"george","  Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
"jerry"," Awright, let's see. How about Mug?  Mug "
"george"," Alright, you having a good time there?"
"jerry"," I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? "
"george","  Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
"jerry"," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
"george"," Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?"
"jerry"," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
"george"," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
"jerry","  I'm not engaged."
"kramer"," Ah, I got it."
"jerry"," Got what?"
"kramer","  Got the answer, Jerry. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
"kramer"," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
"kramer"," Here. I write it down.  ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
"jerry"," Sort of a mooching inventory."
"kramer"," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
"jerry"," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
"kramer"," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
"kramer","  Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
"jerry"," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
"george"," The same outfit?"
"jerry"," The exact same outfit."
"george"," How many days was it between encounters."
"jerry"," Three."
"george"," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
"jerry"," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
"george"," Maybe she moved it up in the rotation."
"jerry"," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
"george"," Very curious."
"jerry"," Indeed."
"george"," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
"jerry"," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
"george","  Awright, I'm heading home."
"jerry"," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
"george","  Not yet, but she's weakening."
"jerry"," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
"george"," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
"jerry"," How about 'Mickey'?"
"george"," 'Mickey'?  'Mickey'!"
"kramer"," Hey buddy."
"jerry","  Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
"kramer"," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
"jerry"," You cannot buy half a can of soda."
"kramer"," Well, why not."
"jerry"," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
"jerry"," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
"kramer"," Alright."
"jerry"," ...You bite it, you bought it."
"kramer"," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Oh.  So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
"elaine"," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
"kramer","  It's a verbal contract. We had a deal."
"elaine"," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
"kramer"," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
"elaine"," This is not the point.  The point is, you just can't 
      "
"kramer"," Boy, I am really surprised at you.  You are 
      "
"kramer"," I always put you up here..."
"kramer"," ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww."
"elaine","  Alright."
"kramer","  Digidi."
"george"," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
"susan"," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
"george"," Why not?"
"susan"," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
"george"," So, what're you saying?"
"susan"," They're gonna name their baby Seven."
"george","  What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
"susan"," I can't believe that they're using it."
"george","  Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
"susan"," I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with."
"george","  Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
"elaine","  Oh god! Oh, god.  Kramer!"
"elaine","  Oh, ah.  Stupid Kramer."
"elaine"," Huh?"
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
"elaine","  I'm fine."
"elaine","  Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
"kramer"," You got that right!"
"elaine","  Kramer! Kramer!"
"george"," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
"elaine"," Kramer!!"
"jerry"," Hey"
"elaine"," Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?"
"jerry"," Haven't seen him. How's the neck?"
"elaine"," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
"jerry"," Boy, I'm surprised.  I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
"elaine"," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
"jerry"," You saw her? What was she wearing?"
"elaine"," I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of 
      "
"jerry"," Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?"
"elaine"," What d'you care?"
"jerry"," Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress."
"elaine"," Did you have a nice ride?"
"kramer"," Oh, great ride."
"elaine"," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
"kramer"," What're you talking about?! We had a deal!"
"elaine","  You better give me back that bike!  
      "
"kramer"," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
"elaine"," What? You never told me that."
"kramer"," Well, it's common sense."
"elaine"," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
"kramer"," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
"elaine"," Yeah Jerry."
"jerry"," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
"elaine"," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
"kramer"," Alright, I'm down."
"jerry"," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
"elaine"," So, that's the situation."
"newman"," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
"kramer"," Newman!"
"newman"," ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, 
        no "
"kramer"," Uh, yeah."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"newman"," Alright, let's begin."
"newman","  Ooh, my cocoa!"
"george"," It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it."
"george"," Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't 
      "
"george","  What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
"george"," You don't care for Soda?!"
"george","  How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's "
"george"," What about Six?"
"george"," Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good."
"george"," Fourteen.  Fourteen!"
"jerry"," No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure you do."
"jerry"," Oh."
"jerry"," Change?  Yes, I think that's a super idea."
"george","  You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow 
      "
"george","  It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
"george","  So am I!"
"newman"," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
"newman"," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "
"newman"," ...But I have made a decision.  We will cut the "
"elaine","  What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!"
"elaine"," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead.  Cut the stupid thing 
      "
"kramer"," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
"newman"," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
"elaine"," What?!"
"kramer"," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
"elaine","  But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
"kramer"," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
"jerry","  Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
"jerry"," Yes, change. By all means, change."
"jerry"," What're you doing? I thought you were changing."
"jerry"," No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
"jerry"," You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on 
      "
"jerry"," You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?"
"jerry","  Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you 
      "
"george","  You know, you're really being very selfish. It "
"george","  Please! I have so little!"
"george"," I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!"
"george"," Seven!!"
"jerry"," Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?"
"kramer","  Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking 
      "
"jerry"," Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little 
      "
"kramer","  Yikes."
"jerry"," I know. Pretty steep."
"kramer"," Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
"jerry"," Few do."
"kramer"," I'm good for it."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
"jerry"," ...the food court is closed."
"kramer","  Alright. I'll get that money for you in five 
      "
"elaine"," Hey, that's my bike!"
"newman"," Gangway!"
"elaine"," This is my bike!"
"newman"," Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for

"newman"," Hey!! Help me!"
"jerry"," I love it when people are complimented on something they're "
"elaine","  Oh, look at this!"
"jerry"," Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid."
"elaine","  Oh, cool! Look at that!"
"jerry","  Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
"elaine","  That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's "
"elaine"," What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?"
"jerry","  Huh?"

"jerry"," Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
"elaine","  I love it. I'm getting it."
"elaine"," Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
"jerry"," You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
"elaine"," Hey!"
"susan"," A little baby girl?"
"george","  So, Carrie, you and Susan are "
"george","  Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
"susan"," So, have you picked out a name yet?"
"susan"," Aww."
"george","  Hu-ho, boy."

"george"," Yeah, that's right. It's working."
"george"," I solve problems. That's just what I do."
"kramer","  Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."

"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. What's with your neck?"
"elaine"," Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. "
"jerry"," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
"elaine","  Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
"jerry"," Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
"elaine"," Ach, maybe."
"jerry"," Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it."
"elaine"," I don't know."
"jerry"," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned

"elaine"," You really think he wants the bike?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"elaine"," It took him like ten seconds!"
"jerry"," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
"george"," I think they really went for that Soda."
"susan"," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
"george"," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."

"elaine"," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead.  Cut the stupid thing 
      "
"kramer"," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
"newman"," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
"elaine"," What?!"
"kramer"," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
"elaine","  But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
"kramer"," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
"jerry","  Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
"jerry"," Yes, change. By all means, change."
"jerry"," What're you doing? I thought you were changing."
"jerry"," No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
"jerry"," You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on 
      "
"jerry"," You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?"
"jerry","  Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you 
      "
"george","  You know, you're really being very selfish. It "
"george","  Please! I have so little!"
"george"," I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!"
"george"," Seven!!"
"jerry"," Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?"
"kramer","  Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking 
      "
"jerry"," Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little 
      "
"kramer","  Yikes."
"jerry"," I know. Pretty steep."
"kramer"," Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
"jerry"," Few do."
"kramer"," I'm good for it."
"jerry"," Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
"jerry"," ...the food court is closed."
"kramer","  Alright. I'll get that money for you in five 
      "
"elaine"," Hey, that's my bike!"
"newman"," Gangway!"
"elaine"," This is my bike!"
"newman"," Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for

"newman"," Hey!! Help me!"
"jerry"," I love it when people are complimented on something they're "
"elaine","  Oh, look at this!"
"jerry"," Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid."
"elaine","  Oh, cool! Look at that!"
"jerry","  Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
"elaine","  That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's "
"elaine"," What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?"
"jerry","  Huh?"
"elaine"," What d'you think?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
"elaine","  I love it. I'm getting it."
"elaine"," Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
"jerry"," You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
"elaine"," Hey!"
"susan"," A little baby girl?"
"george","  So, Carrie, you and Susan are "
"george","  Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
"susan"," So, have you picked out a name yet?"
"susan"," Aww."
"george","  Hu-ho, boy."
"george"," Ech. What else you got?"
"george"," Aw c'mon, I'm eating here."
"susan","  George!"
"george"," Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, 
      "
"george"," Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda."
"george"," All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you 
      "
"george"," Yeah, that's right. It's working."
"george"," I solve problems. That's just what I do."
"kramer","  Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
"jerry"," You're really going to town with that turkey there."
"kramer"," Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
"kramer"," Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
"jerry"," It's on the door."
"kramer","  What, this yellow stuff? 
      "
"kramer"," Ah, 's no good."
"kramer"," No. That's bush league."
"jerry"," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? "
"kramer"," No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without "
"jerry","  Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your"
"kramer"," Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy 
      "
"jerry"," What arrangement?"
"kramer"," Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I 
      "
"jerry","  Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there 
      "
"kramer"," Oh, hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey. What's with your neck?"
"elaine"," Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. "
"jerry"," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
"elaine","  Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
"jerry"," Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
"elaine"," Ach, maybe."
"jerry"," Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it."
"elaine"," I don't know."
"jerry"," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned 
      "
"elaine","  You know what, why don't you just shut the 
      "
"jerry"," Awright."
"elaine"," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike 
      "
"kramer"," Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
"kramer"," Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
"kramer"," Alright, lean forward, relax."
"elaine","  What? What?"
"kramer"," Encounter shiatsu."
"elaine"," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
"kramer","  Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the 
      "
"elaine"," Ah hah."
"kramer","  He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre."
"elaine","  Wha...?"
"kramer"," He's a genius. Here we go..."
"kramer"," From pain, will come pleasure."
"kramer"," Uh? Voila."
"elaine","  Oh my god!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!"
"jerry"," What's even more amazing is his formal training is in "
"kramer"," Awright, my work is done here."
"elaine","  Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
"kramer","  Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
"elaine","  What?  What, what is he talking about?"
"jerry"," I dunno.  Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
"elaine"," You really think he wants the bike?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah."
"elaine"," It took him like ten seconds!"
"jerry"," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
"george"," I think they really went for that Soda."
"susan"," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
"george"," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
"susan"," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
"george"," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
"susan"," Yeah."
"susan"," What is that? Sign language?"
"george"," No, Seven."
"susan"," Seven Costanza? You're serious?"
"george"," Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl..."
"george"," ...especially a girl. Or a boy."
"susan"," I don't think so."
"george"," What, you don't like the name?"
"susan"," It's not a name. It's a number."
"george"," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
"susan"," It's awful. I hate it!"
"george","  Well, that's the name!"
"susan","  Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
"george","  Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
"jerry"," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
"george","  Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
"jerry"," Awright, let's see. How about Mug?  Mug "
"george"," Alright, you having a good time there?"
"jerry"," I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? "
"george","  Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
"jerry"," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
"george"," Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?"
"jerry"," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
"george"," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
"jerry","  I'm not engaged."
"kramer"," Ah, I got it."
"jerry"," Got what?"
"kramer","  Got the answer, Jerry. "
"jerry"," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
"kramer"," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
"kramer"," Here. I write it down.  ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
"jerry"," Sort of a mooching inventory."
"kramer"," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
"jerry"," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
"kramer"," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
"kramer","  Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
"jerry"," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
"george"," The same outfit?"
"jerry"," The exact same outfit."
"george"," How many days was it between encounters."
"jerry"," Three."
"george"," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
"jerry"," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
"george"," Maybe she moved it up in the rotation."
"jerry"," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
"george"," Very curious."
"jerry"," Indeed."
"george"," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
"jerry"," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
"george","  Awright, I'm heading home."
"jerry"," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
"george","  Not yet, but she's weakening."
"jerry"," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
"george"," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
"jerry"," How about 'Mickey'?"
"george"," 'Mickey'?  'Mickey'!"
"kramer"," Hey buddy."
"jerry","  Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
"kramer"," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
"jerry"," You cannot buy half a can of soda."
"kramer"," Well, why not."
"jerry"," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
"jerry"," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
"kramer"," Alright."
"jerry"," ...You bite it, you bought it."
"kramer"," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
"jerry"," Thank you."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Oh.  So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
"elaine"," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
"kramer","  It's a verbal contract. We had a deal."
"elaine"," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
"kramer"," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
"elaine"," This is not the point.  The point is, you just can't 
      "
"kramer"," Boy, I am really surprised at you.  You are 
      "
"kramer"," I always put you up here..."
"kramer"," ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww."
"elaine","  Alright."
"kramer","  Digidi."
"george"," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
"susan"," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
"george"," Why not?"
"susan"," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
"george"," So, what're you saying?"
"susan"," They're gonna name their baby Seven."
"george","  What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
"susan"," I can't believe that they're using it."
"george","  Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
"susan"," I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with."
"george","  Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
"elaine","  Oh god! Oh, god.  Kramer!"
"elaine","  Oh, ah.  Stupid Kramer."
"elaine"," Huh?"
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
"elaine","  I'm fine."
"elaine","  Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
"kramer"," You got that right!"
"elaine","  Kramer! Kramer!"
"george"," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
"elaine"," Kramer!!"
"jerry"," Hey"
"elaine"," Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?"
"jerry"," Haven't seen him. How's the neck?"
"elaine"," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
"jerry"," Boy, I'm surprised.  I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
"elaine"," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
"jerry"," You saw her? What was she wearing?"
"elaine"," I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of 
      "
"jerry"," Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?"
"elaine"," What d'you care?"
"jerry"," Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress."
"elaine"," Did you have a nice ride?"
"kramer"," Oh, great ride."
"elaine"," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
"kramer"," What're you talking about?! We had a deal!"
"elaine","  You better give me back that bike!  
      "
"kramer"," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
"elaine"," What? You never told me that."
"kramer"," Well, it's common sense."
"elaine"," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
"kramer"," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
"elaine"," Yeah Jerry."
"jerry"," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
"elaine"," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
"kramer"," Alright, I'm down."
"jerry"," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
"elaine"," So, that's the situation."
"newman"," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
"kramer"," Newman!"
"newman"," ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, 
        no "
"kramer"," Uh, yeah."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"newman"," Alright, let's begin."
"newman","  Ooh, my cocoa!"
"george"," It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it."
"george"," Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't 
      "
"george","  What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
"george"," You don't care for Soda?!"
"george","  How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's "
"george"," What about Six?"
"george"," Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good."
"george"," Fourteen.  Fourteen!"
"jerry"," No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure you do."
"jerry"," Oh."
"jerry"," Change?  Yes, I think that's a super idea."
"george","  You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow 
      "
"george","  It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
"george","  So am I!"
"newman"," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
"newman"," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "
"newman"," ...But I have made a decision.  We will cut the "
"elaine","  What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!"
"elaine"," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead.  Cut the stupid thing 
      "
"kramer"," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
"newman"," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
"elaine"," What?!"
"kramer"," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
"elaine","  But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
"kramer"," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
"jerry","  Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
"jerry"," Yes, change. By all means, change."

"george","  Please! I have so little!"
"george"," I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!"
"george"," Seven!!"
"jerry"," Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?"

"newman"," Hey!! Help me!"
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as 
              you may or may"
"elaine"," Right."
"george"," You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your 
              skin is gonna"
"elaine"," Oh, Come on."
"jerry"," Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?"
"george"," Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?"
"jerry"," Yeah, sure. My parents will be there."
"elaine"," The Tonight Show?"
"jerry"," Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?"
"elaine"," Are you doing new material?"
"jerry"," No."
"elaine"," I don't think so."
"kramer"," Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have 
              they"
"jerry"," No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know."
"kramer"," Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that."
"elaine"," So what are your parents doing here in new York?"
"jerry"," Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, 
              my father"
"elaine"," So what are their plans?"
"jerry"," Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new 
              development. "
"elaine"," You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?"
"jerry"," No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, 
              he moved"
"george"," Uncle Leo's having regular sex?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."
"jerry"," You gotta be there at 430."
"jerry"," Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air 
              it at 1130."
"jerry"," 30 years."
"jerry"," All right, I'll see you later."
"elaine"," Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?"
"george"," Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?"
"jerry"," Yeah, it is."
"george"," I mean, they're retired."
"jerry"," No economic reason for them to be here."
"george"," They have no friends."
"jerry"," No social reason for them to be here."
"elaine"," You're all grown up."
"george"," Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell 
              are they"
"jerry"," I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?"
"jerry"," You know Dad just called me."
"jerry"," Yeah, all right, well I got some people here."
"jerry"," All right, bye.  You see this? Any thought pops 
              into their"
"elaine"," Ahh."
"jerry"," I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. 
              Plus I got"
"elaine"," They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?"
"jerry"," The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend 
              and has"
"elaine"," How's that gonna happen?"
"jerry"," I don't know how you do it."
"jerry"," A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't 
              know. But it's"
"jerry"," Well..."
"jerry"," Hey, it happens."
"jerry"," He has no idea who you are."

              made your"
"jerry"," Well, keep looking."
"elaine"," What? Why not?"
"elaine"," Opium?"
"elaine"," Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. 
              Strugatz"
"elaine"," Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this 
              test. I"
"elaine"," Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman.  I'll 
              be ready"
"george"," Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, 
              huh. "
"george"," You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? 
              Seventy-nine. "
"george"," What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? "
"george"," That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great 
              deal. Yep. "
"george"," What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins 
              down there."
"george"," You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto 
              the"
"george"," Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about 
            your comfort, be it here in Queens or <a href=""http//www.london-fire.gov.uk/GamesAndActivities.asp"">twelve</a>-hundred miles away            "
"elaine"," No?"
"kramer"," Jerry? Jerry!"
"kramer"," Wha, you too?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"kramer"," These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't 
              get the"
"jerry"," Me either."
"kramer"," If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak 
              and"
"jerry"," You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm 
              gonna have to"
"jerry"," Where are you going?"
"kramer"," I gotta find another shower."
"kramer"," They got you too?"
"newman"," This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!"
"kramer"," Oh, Elaine. Yeah."
"elaine"," Kramer, you look terrible."
"kramer"," Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a 
              shower."
"elaine"," What's wrong with your shower?"
"kramer"," There's no water pressure."
"elaine"," Why don't you just go see Jerry?"
"kramer"," Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only 
              one I know"
"elaine"," Mr Peterman! What are you doing?"
"elaine"," Huh?"
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not 
              addicted to"
"jerry"," There's more food down the hall."
"jerry"," Oh, hi."
"jerry"," Actually, I'm drunk."
"george"," Hey, hey, how was Florida?"
"jerry"," I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you 
              could perhaps"
"elaine"," How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand,"
"elaine"," I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna 
              meet the"
"elaine"," And the bushwomen."
"elaine"," Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time."
"jerry"," Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; 
              they're"
"jerry"," Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend 
              because of"
"jerry"," Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, 
              isn't"
"jerry"," Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?"
"kramer"," I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?"
"jerry"," No good?"
"kramer"," It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my 
              own filth. "
"jerry"," Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?"
"kramer"," Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in 
              that."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah."
"elaine"," Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I 
              was testing"
"jerry"," Poppy seeds!"
"kramer"," Well, that makes sense.  Want some 
              chicken?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully 
              I'll"
"jerry"," Hello Newman."
"newman"," Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little 
              problem. "
"elaine"," Oh c'mon, Newman."
"newman"," I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. 
              (Opens"
"elaine"," Jerry?"
"newman"," Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? 
              Beat it!"
"jerry"," Not from the footage I've seen."
"newman"," Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market 
              Diner, an"
"kramer"," I'm down."
"newman"," Jerry?"
"george"," Big news?"
"george"," What do you mean?"
"george"," So you're moving there for spite!"
"george"," That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!"
"george"," Oh, every chance I get."
"george"," Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!"
"jerry"," What's going on?"
"george"," My parents are moving to Florida!"
"jerry"," Are you kidding?"
"george"," Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! 
              I'm"
"jerry"," Where are they moving to?"
"george"," Del Boca Vista!"
"jerry"," Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!"
"george"," I know!"
"jerry"," We could visit together!"
"george"," Every five years!"
"jerry"," That's incredible!"
"george"," I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?"
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," To spite your parents!"
"jerry"," To spite my parents?"
"george"," Yeah!"
"jerry"," Your parents are crazy!"
"george"," I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!"
"jerry"," My parents are moving back too!"
"george"," Beautiful!"
"george"," I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner."
"jerry"," You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result 
              of this. "
"jerry"," Hello."
"jerry"," Oh, hi dad."
"jerry"," Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're 
              gonna"
"jerry"," But it's a big complex."
"jerry"," All right, fine. Come over here. "
"jerry"," They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here."
"george"," What? Why?"
"jerry"," Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone 
              just went"
"george"," Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. 
              It's my turn"
"jerry"," You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent"
"jerry"," C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody."
"jerry"," Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're"
"jerry"," Can you blame her?"
"elaine"," Oh."
"elaine"," Hello. Jerry's not here?"
"elaine"," Huh.  Oh my god."
"elaine"," A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm 
              dead. I'm"
"elaine"," It's a long story."
"elaine"," What are you gonna do in there?"
"elaine"," You gotta do me a favor."
"elaine"," Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample."
"elaine"," I need a clean urine sample from a woman."
"elaine"," Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?"
"elaine"," Well, one of those glasses."
"elaine"," Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom."
"elaine"," Yeah, a coffee cup's fine."
"elaine"," Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect."
"elaine"," It doesn't matter."
"elaine"," A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass."
"elaine"," Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!"
"jerry"," What do you recommend?"
"kramer"," Power, man. Power."
"newman"," Like Silkwood."
"kramer"," That's for radiation."
"newman"," That's right."
"kramer"," Well that's what we want, the Commando 450."
"newman"," We'll pay anything. We've got the  "
"kramer"," He couldn't handle that, he's delicate."
"elaine"," Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?"
"elaine"," What? Why not?"
"elaine"," But I wanted to see the bushmen."
"jerry"," Well, it's been a great visit."
"jerry"," Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided 
              not to move. "
"jerry"," You have no idea."
"jerry"," Thank you! Goodnight! "
"jerry","  Hey. Hey!"
"jerry"," Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?"
"jerry","  Oh, thanks."
"jerry","  I believe you."
"jerry","  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight 
        to the airport."
"jerry"," Oh?"
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"george","  I am aware."
"george"," A billiard parlor?"
"george"," Well, that's.. Elaine!"
"elaine"," Oh, hi, Frank."
"george","  Sit down. Join us, please."
"elaine","  Actually, 
        I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing."
"george","  Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down."
"elaine","  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo?"
"george","  What photo?"
"elaine"," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front 
        of the sign that said ""Costanza""?"
"elaine"," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the 
        sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it."
"elaine"," Who is that?"
"george","  
        When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind."
"elaine"," So, you weren't born here?"
"george"," I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are 
        probably a million Costanzas-"
"elaine"," No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might."
"elaine"," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, 
        but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him."
"george"," Really? Why?"
"elaine","  Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. 
        I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera 
        stars."
"george"," Who?"
"elaine"," You know the Three Tenors?"
"george"," Yeah..  Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. 
        the other guy."
"elaine","  The other guy."
"jerry"," Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it."
"jerry"," Oh, okay.."
"jerry"," Ohh.. look at this.."
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess 
        broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because 
        of this  stupid thing."
"kramer"," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still 
        salvage some sauce.."
"jerry"," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, 
        and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin."
"kramer","  I see.."
"jerry"," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and 
        this was going to be my bit on the show."
"kramer"," Well, why don't you do your material?"
"jerry"," I'm out."
"kramer","  Well, you better get to work."
"jerry","  Thanks for the tip."
"george"," Hey, buddies."
"jerry"," Hey. Hey, this is for you.  It's from.. uh, Susan's 
        roommate, Sally."
"george"," Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys 
        really hit it off."
"jerry","  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave 
        me the box.  What the hell are 
        you doing?"
"kramer","  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? 
        "
"jerry","  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
"kramer","  Jerry, why don't you do a bit 
        on Styrofoam?"
"jerry"," Like what?"
"kramer"," Well, uh..  ""What is 
        this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"""
"jerry","  Where's the punchline?"
"kramer"," It's all attitude.. "
"jerry"," A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!"
"george"," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's 
        a big executive for Federal Express."
"jerry"," Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just 
        ship it?!"
"kramer"," Look, it's personalized.  ""The Costanzas"""
"george"," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it."
"kramer"," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that."
"george"," I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool 
        table in my old bedroom."
"kramer","  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock 
        a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.."
"kramer"," So, what's your game? What do you like to play?"
"kramer"," No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight 
        pool.. hmm?"
"kramer"," Yeah, now and then - you know how it is.."
"kramer"," I'll break."
"george"," What's all this?"
"susan"," Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff."
"george","  More stuff.."
"susan","  Oh, I put up my doll collection.."
"george"," Oh my God! What is that?!"
"susan","  What? What is it?"
"george","  This doll  looks like my mother."
"susan"," George, it's a doll."
"george"," I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!"
"susan","  Oh, get outta here.."
"kramer","  Well, we're still, uh, 
        learning the subtleties of the table."
"kramer","  As soon as the game is over.."
"kramer"," Eleven, corner pocket. "
"george"," What is this thing doing here?"
"susan"," Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little 
        girl.."
"george"," Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this.."
"susan"," Why?"
"george"," I feel like I'm in bed with my mother."
"susan"," Oh, stop it."
"jerry"," Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush 
        I just got - the Ori-dent."
"elaine","  Oh yeah?"
"jerry"," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you 
        just came from the dentist!"
"elaine","  Oh, that's dynamite."
"jerry"," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the 
        Charles Grodin show?"
"elaine"," Who else is on the show?"
"jerry"," Uh.. one of the three tenors."
"elaine","  The Three Tenors?  Which one?!"
"jerry"," Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo.."
"elaine","  The other guy?!"
"jerry","  Yeah, the other guy."
"elaine","  My God! I can't believe the other guy's 
        going to be on the show!"
"jerry"," Why?"
"elaine"," Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged 
        to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?"
"jerry"," Why not?"
"elaine","  Wow! The other guy!"
"jerry"," Hey, you look awful."
"george","  I'm on no sleep, bro."
"jerry"," Problem in the bedroom?"
"george","  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls 
        looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it."
"jerry"," Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?"
"george","  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty 
        spooky.  It's freakin' me out 
        man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat."
"jerry"," I thought you didn't want the doormat."
"george"," I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow."
"jerry"," Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New 
        York?"
"george"," Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited."
"jerry"," Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and 
        she made me carry that box?!"
"elaine"," Who's Sally?"
"george"," Susan's college roommate."
"jerry"," It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to 
        give to Charles Grodin on his show."
"george"," So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll 
        be delighted to talk to you."
"jerry","  I will - don't worry.  
        In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really 
        heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her 
        lap!"
"elaine"," That's sounds pretty juvenile."
"jerry","  Hey! A dinosaur!"
"kramer"," Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you 
        in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room."
"kramer"," A billiard room."
"kramer","  What?"
"kramer","  The Place To Be!"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah?"
"kramer"," Really?"
"kramer"," That's good thinking."
"george"," You see?.. You see?!"
"jerry"," Well, it doesn't look exactly like her."
"george"," Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly 
        what she's gonna look like in ten years!"
"jerry"," Why don't you just get rid of it?"
"george"," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't 
        do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing."
"jerry"," Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home."
"george"," Hi, Elaine."
"elaine"," Did you see that?!"
"jerry"," I'm just glad it's outta here.  What's that? 
        "
"elaine"," Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors."
"jerry"," Oh.  Yeah?"
"jerry"," Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?"
"jerry","  Excellent.  So, did you buy that electric 
        toothbrush I was telling you about?"
"elaine","  No."
"jerry"," How come? I told you - It's fantastic."
"elaine"," Eh, I like mine."
"jerry"," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. 
        Don't you believe me?"
"elaine"," I don't want it."
"jerry","  I don't understand this. Why 
        wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's 
        better? And it's not a little better - it's much better."
"elaine","  It doesn't matter to me."
"jerry"," Come in."
"jerry"," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally."
"elaine"," Hi."
"jerry"," How was your flight?  Pretty uncomfortable?"
"jerry","  Oh..  Oh, wait..  This isn't the sauce that I asked for!"
"jerry","  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with 
        that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!"
"jerry"," I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going 
        on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing!"
"jerry","  I don't have any material!"
"elaine","  He's got nothin'!"
"george","  Don't tell me how to eat!"
"george","  Because I like this one!  C'mon, let's go. Let's go!  Oh, hi.. "
"kramer"," Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain 
        perfectly creased."
"kramer"," Come on. Are you sure?"
"kramer"," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot."
"kramer","  Well, that's because you don't know how 
        to follow through correctly."
"kramer"," Right here, come on, I'll show you..  Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back 
        slowly.."
"jerry","  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do 
        this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about."
"elaine"," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?"
"jerry"," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all 
        the time I'd be able to get some work done."
"elaine","  Me? Are you talking about me?"
"jerry","  No. You're never here."
"elaine","  Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Really.  Hey, you know what? Maybe I could 
        talk about that on the show."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty 
        funny.  I'm gonna call them."
"jerry"," Hello, Susan? It's Jerry."
"jerry","  Oh. Is George there?"
"jerry"," Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio 
        with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her."
"jerry","  Yes."
"kramer"," Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch, 
        fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.  
        You know where it's going.."
"elaine"," Is George here?"
"jerry"," Not yet.  The other guy."
"elaine"," It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. 
        Would you mind signing this poster for me?"
"elaine","  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Mr..  
        Camaro.  Mr. Casea?  Well, whatever.  I'm gonna take this to 
        the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center."
"jerry","  Well, that's one hell of a gig.  Hey, look, I got something 
        for you. The Ori-dent!"
"elaine","  Ohh.. thank you.  Huh..  Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?"
"jerry"," Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of 
        packaging."
"elaine","  How am I supposed 
        to carry this thing?  
        What are you doing?"
"jerry"," Well, I want to sit down."
"elaine"," So?"
"jerry"," It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in 
        the pants. "
"kramer","  Aw, beautiful!"
"jerry","  Where's George?"
"jerry","  No! That's the wrong doll!"
"jerry","  This is a nightmare."
"jerry"," My pants!"
"elaine"," I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give 
        you this."
"elaine"," No, no, no. Not the toothbrush..  this."
"elaine"," Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.."
"elaine"," Oh, ok! "
"susan"," I want to know why you took my doll out of the house."
"george"," I just wanted a second opinion."
"susan","  No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!"
"george","  I told you it looked like her.."
"jerry"," ""I'm looking for a crested blazer"""
"jerry"," ""I've worn one once and I really think it did something 
              for me."""
"jerry","  ""Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers."""
"jerry"," ""You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll 
              come back later with someone"
"jerry"," ""Really I'll be back."""
"jerry"," ""So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the 
              guy spent fifteen minutes with me"
"elaine"," ""Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!"""
"jerry"," ""Yeah..... He caught me"""
"elaine"," ""That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back 
              there if you don't want the coat?"""
"jerry"," ""Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him 
              I wasn't."""
"elaine"," ""But you were!!"""
"jerry"," ""But if you go back with me , then I'm not."""

"george"," ""He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing 
              Technicolor Dreamcoat."
"jerry"," ""Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes 
              a career choice."""
"kramer"," ""About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for 
              a peek.."""
"george","  ""Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car 
              off at the new lot."""

"elaine","  Fifteen thousand!!"
"elaine"," Peterman is gonna kill me."
"jerry"," I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand."
"elaine"," Why didn't you stop me?"
"jerry"," Do you hear this clunking?"
"elaine","  A little."
"elaine"," Oh. You know what?  I'm gonna grab these from 
      "
"jerry"," Okay."
"elaine"," Alrighty, bye."
"jerry"," Bye."
"jerry"," What's going on here?"
"jerry"," Oh God!"
"jerry","  Oh, you idiots!"
"newman"," So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and 
      "
"kramer"," Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon.  Hey, there he 
      "
"jerry"," Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?"
"kramer","  Aw, that's right, we forgot about those."
"newman","  That's where my missing soda is."
"jerry"," And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said 
      "
"kramer"," We ran outta space."
"jerry"," Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out."
"kramer"," Ah, Tony, he's good."
"jerry"," Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He 
      "
"kramer","  'Choke?' "
"jerry"," No, thank you."
"jerry"," Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I "
"jerry"," There's really nothing wrong on the inside."
"jerry"," No, I hadn't noticed."
"jerry"," Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and "
"jerry"," The engine is really the only thing that needs checking."
"jerry"," Try to."
"elaine"," I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just 
      "
"elaine","  They should be here today."
"george"," Uh, Mr Wilhelm."

"george"," I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some

"jerry"," Okay, so how does it go?"
"george"," 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can "
"jerry"," '... downtown.'"
"george"," 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never "
"jerry"," '...downtown.'"
"george"," Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.'

"jerry"," Hello."
"elaine"," Hi, it's me."
"jerry"," Oh, hi."
"elaine"," Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman."
"jerry"," Oh, you know what?"
"elaine","  Oh no. What?"
"jerry"," Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car."
"elaine"," You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?"
"jerry"," I forgot."
"elaine"," Oh, go down and get them."
"jerry"," I can't. The car's at the mechanics."
"elaine"," Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll

"elaine","  Ugh, okay, alright, fine."
"jerry"," Hey, Tony."
"jerry"," Sure."
"jerry"," Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down "
"jerry"," I really wanna..."
"jerry"," How much money is this gonna cost me?"

"jerry"," He's bringing it."
"elaine"," Good."
"jerry"," New hairdo?"
"elaine","  Yeah."
"jerry"," You look like Brenda Starr."
"elaine"," Is that good?"
"jerry"," It's better than Dondi."
"elaine"," Hey, my God, look at that.  David and Beth Lookner.  You"
"jerry","  Really?"
"elaine"," Mm-hmm."
"jerry"," You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner."
"elaine"," Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind 
              of sponge-worthy. "
"jerry"," Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years."
"elaine"," Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three 
              marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on."
"george"," This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces."
"elaine"," Oh,  that's mine."
"george"," You have a car?"
"elaine"," Well, my friend, Alyse, lent it to me for the week. She's 
              out of town."
"jerry","  You know, I've never seen you drive."
"george"," Me either."
"elaine","  Hi, David!"
"jerry"," Hi, Beth!"
"george"," Oh, hi.. "
"george"," Yeah. Why, what do you do?"
"george"," Really?"
"george","  A physician married to a salesman.  
              Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than 
              him."
"kramer"," Hey!"
"jerry"," Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?"
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. "
"jerry"," Kramer?"
"kramer"," Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder."
"jerry"," Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. 
              So.. "
"kramer","  Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These 
              pants are fallin' apart, huh?"
"jerry","  You know, when 
              I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time."
"kramer","  Yeah, well, 
              I was a different man then."
"jerry","  With a different 
              body."
"kramer","  Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, 
              pre-teen, Swedish boy."
"jerry"," Ehh, I dunno.."
"kramer"," Now, what are you thinkin'?  You think that 
              I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? 
              Because if that's what you're"
"elaine"," God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! 
               How 
              about a left turn signal, ya moron?!"
"jerry","  I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver."
"elaine"," You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog.  I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it 
              was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks"
"jerry","  I'm so car 
              sick. I'm gonna vomit!"
"elaine"," Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth 
              got separated last night!"
"jerry","  Huh?"
"elaine"," They're gettin' divorced! "
"elaine"," So, now, what is our move? What do we do?"
"jerry"," I don't know, but we don't have much time."
"elaine","  Mm."
"jerry"," The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting 
              out that marriage."
"elaine"," Right."
"jerry"," It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building 
              - you gotta take immediate action."
"elaine"," Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving 
              time."
"jerry"," Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling 
              Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you 
              do likewise."
"elaine","  Yeah, yeah.."
"jerry"," But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates."
"elaine"," Then why are we calling?"
"jerry"," Good question.  Why are 
              we calling?"
"elaine","  Oh!  I've got it! I've 
              got it! We're calling just to say, ""I'm there for you."""
"jerry","  ""I'm there for you."""
"elaine"," Then, after a period of being ""there for you"", 
              we slowly remove the two words ""for you"", and we're just 
               ""there""."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated."
"george"," Really?  Well, you don't think it had anything 
              to do with what I said, do you?"
"jerry"," What'd you say?"
"george"," You know, that, that thing about her being too good for 
              him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just 
              being folksy..?"
"elaine"," Yeah, I thought you were being folksy."
"george"," Totally folksy."
"jerry"," hey, uh..  what'd you get 
              there?"
"kramer"," Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees."
"elaine"," Kramer, they're painted on!"
"kramer"," Well, they're slim-fit."

"jerry"," So I didn't miss anything?"
"george"," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. 
               Have you"
"jerry"," Elaine danced?"
"george"," It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music."
"jerry"," Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?"
"george"," What, you mean you know about this?"
"jerry"," For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew 
              what to say to her"
"george"," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit 
              rock bottom."
"jerry"," And by then you've lost interest."
"george"," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my 
              father's car. '68"
"jerry"," What made him get that thing?"
"george"," During that period when my folks were separated he went 
              a little crazy."
"jerry"," Not a very long trip. "
"kramer"," Brody's in."
"jerry"," I don't even have the extra ticket yet."
"kramer"," Well, you better get on the horn."
"elaine"," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know 
              better, I'd say"
"jerry"," How could that be?"
"elaine"," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it 
              could have something"
"jerry"," No, George was there, he said he had a great time."
"elaine"," Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related."
"jerry"," Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
"elaine"," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host 
              company, and the"
"jerry"," Now you're talkin' crazy!"
"elaine"," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. 
              What is it?"
"jerry","  Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'."
"elaine"," Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the 
              party last night?"
"elaine"," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?"
"elaine"," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance 
              from him."
"elaine"," Oh he's not. He's very harmful."
"elaine"," Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's 
              one of the worst"
"elaine"," Yeah, we're good friends."
"george"," So this Anna called me from out of the blue."
"jerry"," Really? I thought you were rebuffed."
"george"," With extreme prejudice."
"jerry"," Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you."
"george"," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine 
              said I was one of"
"jerry"," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, 
              suddenly a"
"george"," I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy."
"jerry"," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend..."
"george"," Yes, yes..."
"jerry"," The bad fianc, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit 
              risk..."
"george"," Okay, the point is made."
"jerry"," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at 
              table as George"
"jerry"," Half of show business is here."
"kramer"," There's Brody. Brody! Over here."
"jerry"," That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there."
"kramer"," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell 
              him, Jerry."
"jerry"," I'm a joke maker."
"kramer"," All right, here we go, Death Blow. "
"jerry","  Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?"
"kramer"," Relax, he does that all the time."
"jerry"," Does what?"
"kramer"," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, 
              huh?"
"jerry"," May I see you outside for a moment please?"
"kramer"," But I want to--"
"jerry"," Outside!"
"elaine"," Hey, have you seen Anna?"
"elaine"," To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?"
"elaine"," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away 
              from him, too!"
"jerry"," What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?"
"kramer"," Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business."
"jerry"," It's not legitimate."
"kramer"," It's a business."
"jerry"," Where did you meet this guy?"
"kramer"," He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 
              94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--"
"jerry"," Kramer. "
"kramer"," Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!"
"jerry"," I don't believe this. "
"george"," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?"
"george"," Yeah, she's a sweet ride."
"george"," Maybe."
"george"," Guess not."
"elaine","  Stay away from her."
"george"," I didn't do nothin'."
"elaine","  Get in the car."
"elaine"," You heard me young lady, get in the car.  And 
              you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff."
"george"," Lighten up."
"kramer"," Go get 'em, Death Blow!  You okay?"
"kramer"," Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy."
"jerry"," Hey, what is going on over there?"
"jerry"," Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing."
"kramer"," Jerry, if the man is in pain..."
"jerry"," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he 
              reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right."
"kramer"," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera."
"jerry"," All right, I'm takin' the camera."
"kramer","  C'mon, let's go."
"jerry"," Oh man..."
"kramer"," Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?"
"jerry"," How was the rest of Death Blow?"
"kramer"," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that 
              Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!"
"jerry"," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours 
              and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!"
"kramer"," He's quite a character, isn't he?"
"jerry"," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to 
              pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!"
"kramer"," I got it. Yep."
"kramer"," Come on up. It's Brody."
"jerry"," What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again."
"kramer"," Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up 
              and thank you."
"jerry"," What if I didn't do it right?"
"kramer"," It's your first time. He'll understand."
"jerry"," People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. 
              Too many"
"kramer"," Hey, Brody!"
"jerry"," Hi."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Well, I did the best I could."
"kramer"," Uh yeah. It's under the couch."
"kramer"," Look at you! You've got another gig!"
"jerry"," I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this."
"kramer"," But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy 
              act. We're"
"jerry"," We're talkin' federal crime here."
"kramer"," Sure, do you need a glove?"
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," At Yankee Stadium?"
"elaine"," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks 
              like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear."
"elaine"," Who did that? Who did that?!?"
"kramer","  The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's 
              precious. "
"jerry"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when 
              you shot this?"
"kramer"," That's fine."
"jerry"," Do you even know what this scene is about?"
"kramer"," It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread."
"jerry"," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of 
              his soul."
"kramer"," Wha? Where?"
"jerry"," Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody 
              and telling him I shot it."
"kramer"," Nah, he's not going to know the difference."
"jerry"," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, 
              there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was 
              asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death 
              Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, 
              because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence 
              and strong sexual content you and I take for granted."
"kramer"," So you'll do the movie? "
"jerry"," I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. 
              Where are my magic markers?"
"kramer"," Right here. "
"elaine"," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did 
              I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. 
              We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.  What?"
"kramer","  This umpf thing."
"elaine"," It's dancing."
"kramer"," No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally."
"elaine"," I dance fine."
"kramer"," You stink. "
"elaine"," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.  
              Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?"
"jerry"," I forgot to make my bed. "
"elaine"," Jerry, do I stink?"
"jerry"," All right, you're beyond stink."
"elaine"," But I really enjoy dancing."
"jerry"," And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' 
              trouble with your staff, not because of George."
"elaine"," It's that bad?"
"jerry"," Have you ever seen yourself?  Ah, ah, 
              please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the 
              laundry. I'll be right back."
"elaine"," George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna 
              say to both of you."
"george"," Yo, Anna."
"george","  You don't wanna know."
"elaine"," Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to 
              keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize."
"george"," What're you talkin' about?"
"elaine"," Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that 
              you're a good and decent person."
"george"," Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!"
"elaine"," I never should have given Anna the impression--"
"george"," Pick it up, pick it up!"
"elaine"," --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed."
"george"," Elaine, get off the speaker! "
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," You are ruinin' everything."
"elaine"," I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. 
              I'm a"
"elaine"," George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna 
              talk to George?"
"elaine"," No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya."
"george"," I'm a bad man!"
"jerry"," No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location."
"jerry"," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm 
              gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. 
              And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to 
              talk to 'em."
"jerry"," Kramer..."
"kramer"," I know, Jerry. It's okay.  Yeah, look, 
              Brody. Uh,"
"jerry"," All right. That's it, I can't work like this."
"kramer"," Jerry..."
"jerry"," I'm off the project. "
"kramer"," Jerry!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"george"," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?"
"jerry"," They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs."
"george"," Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over."
"jerry"," Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money 
              now. The sad thing"
"kramer"," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, 
              he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!"
"jerry"," Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I 
              was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous..."
"george"," Did you say dangerous?"
"george"," I'm a bootlegger."
"george"," I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!"
"george"," I can do hard time for this one. And community service!"
"george","  Get outta my way!"
"kramer"," Jerry, George got arrested."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Yeah. He went at the   Beekman, he tried to land, but they 
              cheesed him."
"jerry"," Oh now I see.  Yeah."
"jerry"," What're we gonna do?"
"kramer"," Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that 
              tape I shot?"
"jerry"," I think that's it.  
              Sweet fancy Moses!"
"kramer"," Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! "
"jerry"," Uh, well. It, uh..."
"kramer"," Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry 
              Again."
"kramer"," Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there."
"jerry"," Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears 
              to be injured."
"kramer"," Yeah, it's a disturbing image."
"jerry"," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry 
              again."
"george"," Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? "
"elaine"," Anna..."
"elaine"," All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. 
              (Mr. Costanza"
"george"," Oh my God."
"george"," Ow! Dad..."
"elaine"," All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards."
"elaine"," You got that right."
"elaine"," It means whatever the hell you want it to mean."
"elaine"," I could drop you like a bag of dirt."
"jerry"," But he's an old man, Elaine."
"elaine"," Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it."
"jerry","  Hey, it's the bootlegged Death 
              Blow that I shot."
"elaine"," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that."
"jerry"," No you don't."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Thank you. "
"elaine"," You were big."
"jerry"," I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how 
              are things at the"
"elaine"," Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every 
              once in a while."
"jerry"," I wouldn't worry about it. "
"newman"," Not so fast pretty boy . There is more to this sorted little 
              affair . "
"george"," Why is there no haggling in this country?"
"jerry"," I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife 
              fight for a "
"george"," Not me. Everything should be negotiable."
"jerry"," Restaurants too?"
"george"," Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on 
              pasta. "
"jerry"," Yea especially ziti, with that big hole. "
"george"," Excuse me, how much is this?"
"george"," I'll give you a quarter."
"jerry"," Tell him forty and no fork."
"george"," Thirty."
"jerry"," How about we leave and come back in a week?"
"george"," Alright see? We got something there. "
"jerry"," Look at the size of that neon light. "
"kramer"," Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken 
              places on "
"jerry"," He is the gambler. "
"kramer"," Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him 
              pick out a"
"jerry"," Try and stay calm. "
"kramer"," Yea, yea. "
"jerry"," Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?"
"jerry"," You wanna grab lunch?"
"jerry"," Seth it's me. What's more important than catching up with 
              an old "
"jerry"," Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we 
              go to?"
"jerry"," Whatever happened to Moochie?"
"jerry"," Is that right?"
"george"," I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me 
              a business "
"elaine"," What do you think of the catalog?"
"george"," It stinks. "
"elaine"," There, we just talked business."
"elaine"," Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other 
              stuff. "
"elaine"," I'll take it. "
"george"," Hey, you like?"
"george"," Really? Elaine...Peterman account?"
"elaine"," Why not?  And some hair for my little friend 
              here. "
"jerry"," Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show 
              in Japan. "
"jerry"," No "
"jerry"," I don't know. So what's this job of yours?"
"jerry"," The meeting you blew off?"
"jerry"," Wasn't that kind of important?"
"elaine"," ...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a water 
              pic."
"jerry"," You use a water pick?"
"elaine"," Sure, water pic, floss, plax, brush, listerine..."
"jerry"," So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what

"elaine"," Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another 
              call. "
"elaine"," Hello?"
"elaine"," Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?"
"elaine"," Well, I am the President."
"elaine"," Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they 
              want?"
"elaine"," Good day.  "
"jerry"," Hello, anybody?"
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey, why didn't you get the big one?"
"george"," This hat just bottles in the heat, I don't even need a 
              coat! It's "
"jerry"," I don't believe it. "
"george"," And I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little 
              Marisa "
"jerry"," Ah, too bad you got a little George Costanza thing going 
              on. "
"george"," I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some 
              errands to run."
"jerry"," That's a date?"
"george"," What's the difference? You know they way I work, I'm like 
              a"
"jerry"," How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?"
"george"," If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind keys, glove, 
              scarf, I go "
"jerry"," That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood 
              horse?"
"jerry"," ""By Mennen"""
"jerry"," What's going on in there?"
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," The light!"
"kramer"," Oh the red, its the chicken roaster sign, its right across 
              my window."
"jerry"," Can't you shut the shades?"
"kramer"," They are shut, oh yea your friend Seth stopped by. "
"jerry"," Yea? What'd he say?"
"kramer"," he was fired."
"elaine"," Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually 
              the "
"elaine"," Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses are obviously 
              for a "
"elaine"," The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?"
"elaine"," What? "
"jerry"," Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you 
              go the "
"jerry"," I only knew you through Moochie."
"jerry"," Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet."
"jerry"," How's life on the red planet?"
"kramer"," Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see 
              is that "
"jerry"," Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?"
"kramer"," Ah, they have me the heave ho. I don't think that Kenny 
              Rogers has "
"jerry"," What are you doing?"
"kramer"," Getting some cereal "
"jerry"," That's tomato juice."
"kramer"," That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are 
              all screwed "
"jerry"," I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that ...."
"jerry"," ..living together after a while we might start to get on 
              each others "
"kramer"," Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy 
              sleeper, "
"jerry"," Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls 
              down, make "
"kramer"," Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come 
              down!"
"jerry"," Yea, that's no good. "
"kramer"," I may have to drive that place out of business."
"jerry"," How you gonna do that?"
"kramer"," Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets."
"george"," Oh no I'm in already come on. "
"george"," So you want to get together tomorrow?"
"george"," What about this weekend?"
"george"," OK, see ya!"
"george"," What, those aren't my keys. "
"george"," Oh, they are my keys, how weird."
"george"," Yea. "
"george"," Costanza. "
"elaine"," What do you mean you don't have the hat?"
"george"," I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?"
"elaine"," No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!"
"george"," Alright, alright ,I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat 
              back, I will "
"george"," Heather Hi, it's George Costanza. "
"george"," Ah , listen. I don't mean to bother you but, silly me, 
              I think I may "
"george"," I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair 
              ..."
"george"," You know maybe ... I'll ... "
"jerry"," Seth?"
"jerry"," I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, 
              but that "
"jerry"," But your were an executive, this is fast food."
"kramer"," Hey, stay away from the chicken, bad chicken, mess you 
              up."
"jerry"," That's not going to be good for anybody. "
"jerry"," If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this 
              stuff out. "
"kramer"," Mr. Marbles? He's harmless."
"jerry"," And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my... "
"jerry"," Oh no. "
"newman"," Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some 
            "
"jerry"," Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real 
              job you two "
"kramer"," What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here."
"newman"," I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird. "
"kramer"," Well I'm boycotting it. "
"kramer"," What is that, hickory?"
"newman"," Yea, it's the wood that makes it good. "
"kramer"," Really?"
"newman"," Uh-Huh."
"kramer"," Oh stop it. "
"elaine"," Hi, yea, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend 
              of George "
"elaine"," I know, he has a real confidence problem."
"george"," Well not really..."
"elaine"," George...Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the 
              hat because"
"george"," Well that makes sense."
"elaine"," Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?"
"george"," Good to see you again. "
"george"," She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere. 
            "
"elaine"," This is an absolute disaster."
"george"," Oh, I don't know. Check this out. "
"elaine"," You stole her clock?"
"elaine"," Well done. "
"george"," Yep, this one for our side! "
"elaine"," So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, 
              what am I "
"kramer"," You should sleep with him."
"jerry"," Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know 
              what it's "
"elaine"," You look a little stressed. "
"jerry"," Oh I'm stressed!"
"elaine"," So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that 
              fur hat by"
"jerry"," You know my friend Bob Sacamano?"
"elaine"," I thought he was Kramer's friend. "
"jerry"," Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, 
              he sells"
"elaine"," fourty bucks? Are they Sable?"
"jerry"," No, but the difference is unnoticeable. "
"kramer"," Oh yea, I like this idea. "
"elaine"," Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go. "
"jerry"," Giddee up!"
"newman"," It's getting cold, it's getting cold."
"kramer"," That was a close one."
"newman"," Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?"
"kramer"," If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back 
              there with "
"elaine"," Well, that's a kind of sable. "
"elaine"," That's a rat hat?"
"elaine"," But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle."
"elaine"," Wait? Can I fire you?"
"kramer"," So Heather called? "
"george"," Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have 
              the time'."
"kramer"," No, but this is all very exciting. "
"george"," She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my 
              hat, I think "
"kramer"," Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right 
              out of your"
"george"," I've looked at that, seems unlikely. "
"kramer"," I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about 
              all this? "
"george"," I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into 
              that "
"kramer"," That's a shame. "
"jerry"," Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?"
"newman"," Number 67, right here, right here! "
"jerry"," Hello Newman. "
"newman"," Hello Jerry."
"jerry"," Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep 
              fried in "
"newman"," I love broccoli, its good for you. "
"jerry"," Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?"
"newman"," Gladly. "
"newman"," Vile weed! "
"jerry"," It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant 
              licking of "
"newman"," Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard. "
"kramer"," Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy. "
"jerry"," Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find 
              him at "
"kramer"," Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place. "
"jerry"," He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, 
              as long "
"kramer"," Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano 
              hat, oh "
"jerry"," I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back."
"kramer"," Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise 
              I'd have no"
"jerry"," I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you 
              the trouble, "
"kramer"," Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me. 
            "
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, 
              you leave "
"jerry"," You got a little problem. "
"kramer"," Oh I got a big problem Jerry! "
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman. "
"elaine"," You speak Burmese?"
"elaine"," No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood."
"elaine"," I work for your mail order catalog. "
"elaine"," Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just 
              sign this "
"george"," So how do you want to do this?"
"george"," So you really don't have my hat?"
"george"," Oh. let's go do something."
"george"," That's a sandwich. "
"george"," Damn salami. "
"george"," That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my 
              orders. "
"jerry"," Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there. "
"jerry"," Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business. "
"kramer"," Kenny? ... Kenny?"
"kramer"," Kenny...."
"jerry"," Home at last. "
"jerry"," Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?"
"elaine"," Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog. "
"jerry"," So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the 
        auto show, I waited for you, you never came."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?"
"jerry"," Five minutes. "
"elaine"," Five minutes? That's it?"
"jerry"," What's the difference? You never showed up."
"elaine"," I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's 
        for like, forty minutes."
"jerry"," Well, we barely knew the guy."
"elaine"," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em."
"jerry"," That's the way it works."
"elaine"," When did you tell George to be here?"
"jerry"," I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?"
"elaine"," About five."
"jerry"," That's enough. &lt;They leave. George comes around the corner.&gt;"
"kramer"," So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega."
"jerry"," How did you know about that?"
"kramer"," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all 
        the other bad checks."
"jerry"," He can't do that."
"george"," Fantastic day! Fantastic! "
"jerry"," What happened?"
"george"," Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, 
        that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose."
"jerry"," Fantastic."
"george"," Then, I'm at The Foundation..."
"jerry"," You're still doing that?"
"george"," Sometimes, once in a while."
"jerry"," When you feel guilty."
"george"," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, 
        they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down 
        there and check it out."
"kramer"," That's caged heat."
"george"," Yeah-hah!"
"jerry"," What are you gonna do there?"
"george"," Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, 
        maybe take in a shower fight.  Hey, you know you got a bounced 
        check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"
"jerry"," Yes, I know, I know."
"george"," I noticed you chose the ""clowns with balloons"" check 
        design."
"jerry"," It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones."
"elaine"," Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and 
        Kramer."
"kramer"," Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs."
"kramer"," Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. &lt;Kramer gets up to leave by 
        climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor, 
        then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked 
        in his collar.&gt;"
"jerry"," Is he from the future?"
"elaine"," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy."
"george"," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about 
        guts. &lt;Points to his head.&gt; <i>This</i> is guts."
"elaine"," What? Clinging to some scraps?"
"george"," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains 
        of a once great society of hair."
"elaine"," Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced 
        a clown check!"
"jerry"," Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino."
"jerry"," But it's your bodega."
"george"," Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang 
        fights?"
"george"," Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?"
"george"," Thanks, Warden."
"george"," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. &lt;Notices 
        another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.&gt; So uh, you 
        two shop at the same store?"
"george"," Oh my God...you're in jail? &lt;Celia nods.&gt; That is so cool!"
"jerry"," You asked her out?"
"george"," Well...not ""out."" She's in prison."
"jerry"," How could you ask her out?"
"george"," Why not?"
"jerry"," I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens 
        because you didn't want to go over the bridge!"
"george"," That was different! "
"jerry"," I'll say."
"george"," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the 
        time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear 
        of the pop-in?"
"george"," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I 
        saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really 
        well..."
"jerry"," Conjugal visit?"
"kramer"," Hey. What's up?"
"jerry"," George is dating a convict."
"kramer"," Oh? What's she in for?"
"george"," Embezzlement."
"jerry"," Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?"
"kramer"," Well, not here. &lt;Goes into the hallway, comes back in with 
        a huge bag of chicken feed.&gt;"
"jerry"," Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?"
"kramer"," Well, it's chicken feed. &lt;Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.&gt; 
      "
"jerry"," I sense something is afoot."
"george"," Allow me. Why?"
"kramer"," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs."
"jerry"," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?"
"elaine"," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was."
"elaine"," Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under 
        it? &lt;Kurt shrugs.&gt;"
"jerry"," Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?"
"kramer"," Oh, Jerry loves the morning."
"jerry"," Who?"
"kramer"," Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you."
"jerry"," Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is <i>not</i> a chicken."
"kramer"," Of course it is. I picked it out myself."
"jerry"," Well, you picked out a rooster."
"kramer"," Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production."
"george"," Yeah. I had a great time."
"george"," The whole hour just flew by. &lt;Begins cleaning up the table.&gt;"
"george"," Oh, thanks, Bobby.  Well, I guess I'll see you in four 
        days."
"george"," Of course you will. You're the best."
"jerry"," Hello?"
"jerry"," I'm not having money problems."
"jerry"," I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! &lt;George enters.&gt;"
"jerry"," You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!"
"jerry"," Ma! Ma! MA! &lt;Hangs up the phone in disgust.&gt;"
"george"," How're the folks?"
"jerry"," Good."
"george"," So? Movie tonight?"
"jerry"," I thought you were going out with Celia."
"george"," I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!"
"jerry"," Having her in jail."
"george"," The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with 
        this now."
"jerry"," Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it."
"elaine"," Here. &lt;Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.&gt; Take a 
        look at that."
"jerry"," Huh. Kurt's an organ donor."
"elaine"," No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. &lt;George 
        overhears and stands up, concerned.&gt;"
"jerry"," So he just shaves his head for no reason?"
"george"," That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!"
"elaine"," And he's growing it in just for me.  It's mine. It's 
        all mine."
"jerry"," It's just hair."
"elaine"," It's not just hair! Look! &lt;Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.&gt;"
"jerry"," It's brown."
"elaine"," It's chestnut with auburn highlights!"
"jerry"," So?"
"elaine"," You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's 
        hair is. &lt;They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and 
        struggling to keep his composure.&gt; I'm sorry, George, but it's true."
"kramer"," Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld."
"kramer"," Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?"
"elaine"," Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little 
        seedlings here. Huh..."
"elaine"," Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here."
"elaine"," Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head 
        for?"
"elaine"," Huh."
"george"," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something 
        nice."
"george"," Parole! &lt;Feigning joy&gt; That's dynamite!"
"jerry"," So Marcelino's going to take down the check?"
"kramer"," Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight."
"jerry"," Great! &lt;realizing&gt; What?"
"kramer"," Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store."
"jerry"," Ah ha..."
"kramer"," So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down."
"jerry"," Kramer, cockfighting is illegal."
"kramer"," Only in The United States."
"jerry"," It's inhumane!"
"kramer"," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is."
"jerry"," It's two roosters peckin' at each other!"
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"kramer"," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like 
        ""American Gladiators."""
"jerry"," No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt."
"kramer"," Well, I left him with Marcelino!"
"kramer"," My Little Jerry! &lt;Runs out.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?"
"kramer"," Well, he's more than O.K., he won!"
"jerry"," You let him fight?"
"kramer"," I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have 
        seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! 
        He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even 
        have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight 
        lasted two seconds."
"jerry"," How long do they usually last?"
"kramer"," Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down 
        today."
"jerry"," Great!"
"kramer"," Hey."
"george"," Celia's up for parole."
"kramer"," Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight."
"george"," What?"
"kramer"," Who?"
"jerry"," I'm too tired."
"jerry"," Alright. &lt;Kramer leaves.&gt;"
"jerry"," Ah, I'm so sorry."
"george"," She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make 
        up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. &lt;Rubs his forehead.&gt; Talking..."
"jerry"," In other words, a normal relationship."
"george"," And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all 
        seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go."
"jerry"," Well, she'll still be an ex-con."
"george"," It's not the same. "
"jerry"," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll 
        pick her up on something."
"elaine"," Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?"
"elaine"," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt."
"elaine"," You already ate?"
"jerry"," Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!"
"jerry"," New deal?"
"jerry"," This is outrageous!  Pack of Juicy Fruit."
"jerry"," 85 cents? <i>That</i> is outrageous!"
"jerry"," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld. 
      "
"kramer"," Well, that's out of the question."
"jerry"," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity."
"kramer"," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!"
"jerry"," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the 
        cockfighter and be done with it!"
"kramer"," You know, I think you're jealous."
"jerry"," Of what?"
"jerry"," Kramer, give me that rooster!"
"kramer"," Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than 
        you ever will! Yah-yah! &lt;Kramer leaves.&gt;"
"george"," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. 
        Very smart. Very...crafty. "
"george"," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together 
        with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them, 
        you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. "
"jerry"," Kramer won't sell."
"jerry"," Well, thank you, Marcelino."
"jerry"," You want Little Jerry to take a dive?"
"jerry"," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive."
"jerry"," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down 
        for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please 
        leave."
"jerry"," We'll see about that. &lt;Runs to the window and shouts up to 
        Kramer, who's on the roof.&gt; Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight 
        to win!"
"kramer"," O.K.!"
"george"," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. "
"george"," You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances 
        beyond this perimeter - &lt;points at Kurt's head with a pen&gt; - then 
        you won't be Kurt anymore."
"george"," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was 
        the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. &lt;There's 
        a knock at the door.&gt; Excuse me."
"george"," Celia? What are you doing here?"
"elaine"," Kurt!"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. &lt;Kramer picks 
        up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.&gt; Little Jerry is lean, mean, 
        peckin' machine! &lt;Kramer starts filling a pot with water.&gt; What 
        are you doing with that?"
"kramer"," I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little 
        Jerry."
"jerry"," Hey, Kramer...?"
"jerry"," Be careful. &lt;George enters.&gt; Hey, guess what! Little Jerry 
        ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!"
"george"," Is that good?"
"jerry"," I don't know. Where have you been?"
"george"," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows 
        up at the door!"
"jerry"," Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!"
"george"," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even 
        better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime 
        -"
"elaine"," Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I 
        mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" 
        time..."
"elaine"," Yeah, yeah, that too."
"elaine"," I don't know...a year?"
"elaine"," Could I see the ring again?"
"elaine"," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. 
        Those'll be good times."
"jerry"," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change."
"elaine"," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. 
        What am I clinging to? &lt;George comes over.&gt;"
"george"," Hey, sorry I'm late. "
"jerry"," Where's Celia?"
"george"," She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. &lt;Kramer 
        comes over with Little Jerry.&gt;"
"jerry"," Hey, how's he doin'?"
"kramer"," He's got a big sweat going. &lt;Takes an envelope out of his 
        pocket.&gt; Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents."
"kramer"," There's Marcelino. &lt;Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge 
        white rooster.&gt;"
"jerry"," Look at the size of his bird!"
"kramer"," That looks like a dog with a glove on his head."
"jerry"," He's a ringer!"
"george"," Where's the tamale guy? &lt;The bell rings, and the cockfight 
        begins.&gt;"
"kramer"," Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him 
        outta there. "
"jerry"," Kramer!"
"elaine"," Stop the fight!"
"elaine"," Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!"
"elaine"," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?"
"elaine"," So, 10 to 14 months."
"jerry"," So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're 
              pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you 
              this thing was good!"
"jerry"," I know.. How about dessert?"
"jerry"," Why?"
"jerry"," What? Today? Really?"
"george"," So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was 
              her birthday?"
"jerry"," Yeah. And she picked the day!"
"george"," Is she socially awkward?"
"jerry"," No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
"george"," Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the 
              Monday after the weekend."
"jerry"," She's not Lincoln."
"kramer"," Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?"
"jerry"," I'll pass."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah? Huh.  Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, 
              yum!"
"george"," Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing 
              high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship."
"jerry"," Does it ever bother you that this organization-"
"george"," Nope!"
"jerry"," is beating the bushes-"
"george"," Nope! "
"jerry"," to basically give this money away-"
"george"," Noo!"
"jerry"," to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?"
"george","  I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine 
              I say! "
"george"," Quick, what's your favorite animal?"
"george","  A frog?"
"george","  Frog is wrong."
"george","  I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, 
              why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? 
              It'd save you a lot of trouble."
"george","  Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know."
"george","  I see your G.P.A's a 4.0."
"george"," so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club."
"george"," Who's your favorite chess player?"
"george"," Right.  Nastercoff.. What country is he from, 
              again?"
"george","  Woah, woah, woah! What are you 
              telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. 
              "
"elaine"," So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do 
              some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. 
              He's gonna let me ghost write it."
"jerry"," Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone 
              to ghost read it."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine"," Hey!"
"kramer"," Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice 
              of the fixin's bar.. garlic,  and what-not.. mmm,"
"jerry"," The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President 
              Martin Van Buren?"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make 
              a move to the door, you know,  they block it! So, 
              I lunged for the bathroom."
"elaine"," What? What happened?"
"kramer"," Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like 
              this  I'm only showing 
              eight fingers."
"jerry"," Well, what does that mean?"
"kramer"," That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth 
              President..  They thought I was a former Van 
              B. Boy!"
"jerry","  She coming of a bad break-up?"
"jerry"," Any messages?"
"jerry"," They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out 
              with her."
"george"," So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone 
              that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. "
"jerry"," There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group."
"george"," Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?"
"jerry"," No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
"george","  Hey, I htink I may have found someone 
              for the scholarship."
"jerry"," Yeah?"
"george"," I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. 
              finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes 
              sports.. watches T.V.."
"jerry"," Is he smart?"
"george","  He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing 
              an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture."
"jerry"," Hey! Just like you pretend to be."
"george"," Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be 
              everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry."
"jerry"," I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!"
"elaine"," Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place 
              isn't quite what I imagined.. "
"elaine"," Well,  what part of your life  
              do you want to start with? Foreign"
"elaine"," Oh. "
"elaine"," Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.."
"elaine"," get, um, started.."
"elaine","  Well, I - I got 
              ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book 
              here."
"elaine"," You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place 
              by the Van Buren Boys?"
"elaine"," Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally 
              flashed their secret gang sign."
"elaine"," But, that didn't happen to you."
"elaine"," No, I - I really don't think you can do that."
"elaine"," You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend."
"jerry"," Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?"
"jerry"," Actually, yeah.  Wait a second! Is that the fork 
              that fell on the floor?!  Are you using the fork that 
              fell on the floor?!"
"jerry"," I guess that's all right."
"jerry"," No, absolutely nothing.  You're fantastic! 
               Hey guys!"
"george"," Hey."
"jerry","  Kramer, George, this is Ellen."
"george"," Ladies and gentlemen, this  is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that 
              meaty part of the curve -"
"george"," I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized 
              tests.."
"george"," Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He 
              wants to be  an architect."
"george","  Steven, nothing is higher than an architect."
"george","  No, it's not."
"george","  It's called a T-square."
"kramer"," And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th 
              President, was the man they most admired."
"kramer"," You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you 
              looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? "
"elaine"," No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -"
"kramer"," My whole lot?"
"kramer","  1500 dollars."
"kramer","  Done!"
"kramer"," Okay..  Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the 
              evenings.. "
"elaine"," Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano 
              story?!"
"kramer"," Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then 
              and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off 
              to the store."
"elaine"," What happened to Bob Saccamano?"
"kramer"," Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.  
              So I'm waiting for the"
"elaine"," Alright, well, now that's something.."
"kramer"," Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but 
              the next think I knew.. "
"elaine","  A train is bearing down on you?!"
"kramer"," No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants 
              I was about to return."
"elaine","  I don't understand.. you were wearing 
              the pants you were returning?"
"kramer"," Well, I guess I was.."
"elaine","  What were you gonna wear on the way back?"
"kramer"," Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there!  
              All right, next story.."
"elaine"," Alright, I think I got enough for one day."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, chew on that."
"elaine","  Yeah, I'll chew on that."
"kramer"," Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together 
              tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.."
"elaine"," Oh, thanks. I've got plans."
"kramer"," Elaine, you should be there to document it."
"elaine","  Oh, you're getting together with 
              some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?"
"kramer"," Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple 
              a chance to loosen up."
"jerry"," So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants 
              to be a city planner?"
"george"," I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's 
              one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh 
              and blood. Like my"
"jerry"," You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.  Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. 
              we're all set for the weekend."
"george"," You're spending the weekend with Ellen?"
"jerry","  Vermont!  
              With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if 
              we want to! (George is"
"george","  You want to start?"
"kramer","  Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get 
              my thoughts together."
"george"," Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough."
"jerry"," What?!"
"kramer","  Jerry, she's a loser. "
"jerry"," Where is this coming from? She's great!"
"george","  Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? 
              Things will pick up."
"jerry"," There's nothing wrong with my career!"
"kramer","  Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive 
              training program for him."
"george"," I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!"
"kramer"," Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider."
"george"," Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!"
"kramer"," Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated."
"jerry","  Alright! Excuse me!  I'm not buying any 
              of this!"
"kramer"," All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, 
              everybody's wrong but you!"
"jerry"," You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy 
              wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!"
"kramer"," Which one?"
"jerry"," They were all like that!"
"george"," Well, Steven, I, uh.. "
"george"," Oh.. nice."
"george"," What about architect, Steven?"
"kramer"," Yeah, well, you got that straight!  Hey, 
              Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh.  
              Real au jus sauce!"
"elaine","  I'll make a note of it."
"kramer"," Yeah?"
"kramer"," Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, 
              and I suddenly realized that I- "
"elaine"," You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman."
"kramer"," What do ya mean?"
"elaine"," You signed the release."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," He sat in mud. Not you."
"kramer"," But I did sit in mud."
"elaine","  Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!"
"kramer","  I was all dirty!"
"elaine"," It ever happened! Understand?"
"kramer","  Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. 
              Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided 
              I wasn't gonna return them!"
"kramer"," What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. "
"kramer","  Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - 
              with the Van Buren Boys."
"kramer"," Hey, now, they're tough cookies."
"george"," Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, 
              what'd you do?"
"kramer"," Uh.. ah,  Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly 
              don't have any stories, if that's"
"george","  Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna 
              do to me?!"
"kramer"," Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, 
              but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind."
"george"," You mean, like, a former member?"
"elaine"," These Kramer stories are unusable!  
              I mean, some of them aren't even stories!  Look, 
              this is a list of things in his"
"jerry"," Is my toaster oven on there?"
"elaine"," How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?"
"jerry"," Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer."
"elaine"," Yes! I'm a writer."
"jerry"," Make them interesting."
"elaine"," Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!"
"jerry"," Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents."
"elaine"," What? Wheren't they just here?"
"jerry"," Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where 
              to turn! I gotta see what they think of her."
"elaine"," Maybe we could all have dinner later?"
"jerry"," I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right 
              back tonight."
"kramer"," Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're 
              gonna love this story!  So, I line up my 
              cold cuts on the couch"
"jerry"," Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!"
"kramer"," Damn!"
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but 
              they all stink!"
"elaine"," How much did you pay for them?"
"kramer"," Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! "
"elaine"," Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?"
"elaine"," Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you 
              see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into 
              a side tunnel - and you run into a"
"elaine"," Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving 
              from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall 
              in some mud, and.. ruin your"
"kramer"," Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!"
"elaine"," No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, 
              as a reference?"
"kramer"," Yippie-yi-yay!"
"george"," Hey, Van B. Boys."
"george"," Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up 
              on one of your own."
"george"," Right.. the sign. "
"george","  It was when I was banging!"
"george"," Love to! "
"jerry","  So? What do you think?"
"jerry"," I knew it! I'm not crazy."
"jerry","  Now, I'm not 
              so sure."
"jerry"," yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas.."
"george"," Alright, alright!  Seinfelds!"
"george"," Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. 
              I'll give it back to you later."
"george"," Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't 
              want to know.  Give me 
              your wallet, or I'll spill your"
"george"," Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!"
"george","  Please, please, they're gonna hit me! "
"george"," Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy."
"jerry"," That's good stuff."
"george"," I can't to myself. I'm exhausted."
"jerry"," Can you grab a nap at work."
"george"," Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd 
        love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. 
        I'll see ya'."
"elaine"," Bye."
"jerry"," So what are you doing now?"
"elaine"," I'm going to take a little stroll through the park."
"jerry"," With a gentleman caller?"
"elaine"," Yes, his name is Hal."
"jerry"," The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right 
        at the other -person."
"elaine"," It's the next best thing to being alone."
"jerry"," Shower?"
"kramer"," No, pool. I just swam 200 laps. "
"elaine"," You are kidding."
"kramer"," Look at hose babies . They're prunes. I saw Conrad going 
        up to oyur place."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that 
        coming?"
"jerry"," A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little 
        decision."
"elaine"," Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?"
"elaine"," What exactly was that kid?"
"kramer"," Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid."
"elaine"," Well I don't care. It was delicious."
"elaine"," Wanna sit down?"
"elaine"," Really?"
"elaine"," Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, ""Back 
        in "", or ""Good Vertibrations""."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?"
"jerry"," Drop one. . . . left! "
"george"," Jerry, look at my eyes."
"jerry"," A little less beady today."
"george"," Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. 
        Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible. 
      "
"jerry"," Sounds like a really cool fort. "
"george"," Conrad, is it?"
"george"," Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space 
        underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?"
"jerry"," He's kind of tied up here."
"george"," It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work 
        after dinner, do you?"
"jerry"," Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?"
"jerry"," So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal."
"elaine"," Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey 
        listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair? 
      "
"jerry"," I don't know. "
"elaine"," Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. . I 
        gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!"
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller? 
      "
"george"," Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, 
        uh, for an alarm clock?"
"george"," Like this."
"george"," Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think 
        about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?"
"george"," Blanket."
"george"," Maybe like this."
"george"," Yeah, like that."
"george"," That is what I want."
"george"," Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better 
        than my bed at home."
"george"," Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep. "
"george"," That's what I want."
"george"," Good morning Mr. Wilhelm."
"kramer"," got problems Jerry."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"kramer"," Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real 
        grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics 
        Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through 
        a flabby armed spanking machine."
"jerry"," How long did that last?"
"kramer"," A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a 
        little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't 
        hold me, Jerry."
"jerry"," How was the movie?"
"elaine"," I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of 
        that guy. "
"jerry"," Why?<br/>
        ELAINE He's got a back problem."
"jerry"," So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay."
"elaine"," After one date!"
"kramer"," What's that guy's last name again?<br/>
        ELAINE Kitzmiller."
"kramer"," Oh, that's right."
"jerry"," So what are you going to do with the mattress?"
"elaine"," I don't know. Chuck it?"
"kramer"," Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's 
        see if it will fit in my bedroom."
"elaine"," Oh, all right."
"kramer"," My old one sprung a leak."
"elaine"," You have a water bed?"
"kramer"," Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach."
"jerry"," How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!"
"jerry"," No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get 
        it done."
"jerry"," Just . . . do it. "
"elaine"," Well, what did you intend, Hal?"
"elaine"," Custom designed?"
"elaine"," Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me."
"elaine"," Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it."
"kramer"," Jer."
"jerry"," Hi."
"kramer"," Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself 
        miles and miles of open lanes."
"jerry"," What is that smell?"
"kramer"," That's East River."
"jerry"," You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked 
        overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?"
"kramer"," Technically Norfolk  has more gross tonnage."
"jerry"," How could you swim in that water?"
"kramer"," I saw a couple of other guys out there."
"jerry"," Swimming?"
"kramer"," Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there."
"elaine","  Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress 
        back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All 
        right, bye."
"elaine"," Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh! "
"jerry","  hello."
"george"," Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. 
        You got to help[ me."
"jerry"," Who is this?"
"george"," Jerry, . . . "
"george"," Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away."
"george"," ?? get away??"
"jerry"," Why don't you just have him paged?"
"george"," Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat."
"jerry"," A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?"
"george"," Just CALL!"
"jerry"," I should have some reason."
"george"," I'm sorry sir."
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," Jerry, Jerry."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"elaine"," What the hell is this? Where are you?"
"jerry"," Over here. You can see right through here."
"elaine"," What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here."
"jerry"," It's kind of cozy."
"elaine"," Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. 
        . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my 
        mattress."
"jerry"," Does it smell like the East River?"
"elaine"," How did you know? "
"jerry"," Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough 
        bridge and the Brooklyn bridge."
"elaine"," Oh, GREAT! "
"kramer"," Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again."
"elaine"," Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks."
"kramer"," Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. 
        I think it might be polluted."
"george"," Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What 
        the hell happened here?"
"elaine"," Hi."
"george"," Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is."
"elaine"," It is obtrusive, isn't it?"
"kramer"," It is very obtrusive."
"jerry"," I don't think it's that bad."
"kramer"," You can't get a stool in here."
"jerry"," No the stools go over there."
"kramer"," No, that's no good. I'm leaving."
"elaine"," I'm with you. I'm going back to my place."
"george"," Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?<br/>
        JERRY You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool."
"george"," Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me."
"jerry"," Hey look at you."
"george"," Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 
        DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT."
"jerry"," No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear."
"george"," ??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL 
        STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING."
"jerry"," Could you at least get a hat for me?"
"george"," FINE? WHAT SIZE?"
"jerry"," Seven and five eighths"
"george"," SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!"
"jerry"," Why are you shouting?"
"george"," I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here."
"elaine"," I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  
        get going."
"elaine"," What smell?"
"elaine"," No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other 
        day and I forgot to hose off my boots. "
"elaine"," Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop."
"george"," Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call 
        back here."
"george"," Let me put that on speaker phone."
"jerry"," Yes this is the terrorist bomber."
"jerry"," think I've changed my mind."
"george"," Good thinking, sir."
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders 
        if the game was going to be rained out."
"george"," You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the 
        phone."
"elaine"," Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza."
"elaine"," I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places 
        to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!"
"kramer"," Oh, hey, "
"elaine"," Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal."
"kramer"," Hal, .. uh Langerhans."
"kramer"," Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right"
"elaine"," You feeling jiff?"
"kramer"," Oh, I'm jiff."
"kramer"," Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really 
        bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and 
        I'll get it back to you as soon as I can."
"elaine"," Oh, baby."
"george"," Lunch."
"kramer"," Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . . "
"kramer"," That's it."
"kramer"," Oh, we go back a ways."
"kramer"," That's right. "
"kramer"," No, no. She put a stop to that. "
"kramer"," Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the 
        back."
"kramer"," Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup. 
      "
"elaine"," I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, 
        oh, okay, . . ."
"jerry"," Yeah, that's right."
"jerry"," One second. Hello."
"elaine"," Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out."
"jerry"," Just lie down."
"elaine"," I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta 
        go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me."
"jerry"," All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go."
"kramer"," What's going on?"
"kramer"," He just sunk like a stone."
"george"," Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter."
"kramer"," Hey, watch where you're kicking!"
"elaine"," Kramer."
"kramer"," Elaine"
"elaine"," I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"george"," Hi Connie, Jerry around?"
"george"," There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space."
"jerry"," Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't 
        believe I got the Low Fat!"
"george"," So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday."
"george"," I was naked."
"jerry"," I saw it."
"jerry"," Okay. I wouldn't see it again."
"george"," Really? What happened?"
"jerry"," I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada."""
"george"," Is ""yada yada"" bad?"
"jerry"," No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct."
"george"," She is succinct."
"jerry"," Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. "
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley."
"george"," Yeah, dentist of the stars."
"jerry"," What's up?"
"jerry"," Excuse me?"
"jerry"," Well...  Welcome aboard."
"george"," Hey, where you just at the health club?"
"jerry"," Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish 
              jokes."
"elaine"," So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get 
              drunk the first night."
"jerry"," Booze is not a religion."
"elaine"," Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner 
              called me."
"jerry"," Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage."
"elaine"," What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months 
              ago. She's already remarried."
"jerry"," I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything."
"elaine"," Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a 
              reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. 
              "
"kramer"," Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or 
              Mickey?"
"elaine"," Hmm, turn around.  Both so striking."
"kramer"," Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap."
"elaine"," How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? 
              "
"george"," What a succinct story."
"george"," Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's."
"george"," Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada..."
"george"," Yada yada yada..."
"kramer"," Well, you too seem to have the same taste."
"kramer"," Well I have the same shirt."
"kramer"," Oh. "
"kramer"," I live for Merlot."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, yeah."
"elaine"," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well 
              sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff."
"elaine"," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. 
              Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've 
              seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, 
              and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" 
              I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're 
              nice people. "
"george"," Oh, you're in here."
"jerry"," What're you doing here?"
"george"," I knew you had an appointment."
"jerry"," Well this is very awkward."
"george"," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am 
              loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole 
              life story. "
"jerry"," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth."
"george"," Hey, what this thing? Whew!"
"jerry"," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. 
              "
"george"," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to 
              make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?"
"jerry"," George..."
"george"," Fine, I'll make an appointment. "
"jerry"," Hey."
"jerry"," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?"
"jerry"," I know, but..."
"jerry"," 5000."
"jerry"," And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride."
"elaine"," Why are you so concerned about this?"
"jerry"," I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to 
              Judaism just for the jokes. "
"jerry"," Yes. "
"kramer"," I don't believe that."
"kramer"," Why were you holding the door open for?"
"kramer"," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was 
              wrong!"
"kramer"," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just 
              take the one that was on the left?"
"kramer"," Oh, everybody's your type."
"kramer"," You've been married three times."
"jerry"," All right, take it easy."
"elaine"," Hey, hey, hey!"
"kramer"," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!"
"elaine"," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. 
              Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across 
              from each other, and see who the girls sit next to."
"kramer"," All right, so we let the girls decide."
"kramer"," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time."
"kramer"," That's right, 'cause they already saw it."
"george"," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the 
              wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single."
"george"," Yada."
"elaine"," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?"
"elaine"," Really."
"elaine"," Oh."
"elaine"," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are 
              and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it."
"jerry"," How you doing?"
"jerry"," Whatley. "
"kramer"," What are they doing here?"
"kramer"," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?"
"kramer"," All right, I'll take Julie."
"kramer"," All right, I'll take Karen."
"kramer"," All right, which one is Julie?  Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. 
              "
"jerry"," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, 
              I used to be Catholic."""
"elaine"," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's 
              more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the 
              buoys.  Bouys!"
"jerry"," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling 
              immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he 
              ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him."
"elaine"," So what're you gonna do?"
"jerry"," I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear 
              what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch."
"elaine","  Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought 
              you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye."
"jerry"," They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to 
              lunch?"
"elaine"," Thought it would be nice."
"jerry"," Poor Beth."
"elaine"," Hey, Arnie's just as upset."
"jerry"," Oh screw him! "
"george"," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend 
              was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired 
              today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex."
"elaine","  I've yada yada'd sex."
"george"," Really?"
"elaine"," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the 
              lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never 
              heard from him again."
"jerry"," But you yada yada'd over the best part."
"elaine"," No, I mentioned the bisk."
"george"," Well, I gotta do somethin'. "
"kramer"," Well, I gotta do somethin'."
"jerry"," George is already in there."
"kramer","  No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You 
              know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself."
"jerry"," I thought you were leaning towards Julie."
"kramer"," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be 
              Karen."
"george"," Well it was a helluva yada yada."
"george"," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. 
              Just give me the full story."
"george"," Tell me about the free facial."
"george"," Which one?"
"george"," Very good. Go on."
"george"," What's that?"
"george"," Shoplifting."
"jerry"," Excuse me, Mother?"
"jerry"," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office 
              hours?"
"jerry"," Hmm, I really need to speak with him."
"jerry"," Oh. "
"jerry"," Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish."
"jerry"," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. 
              I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes."
"jerry"," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you 
              that he's also telling Catholic jokes."
"jerry"," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch 
              in a lifeboat."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada 
              yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys.""  Father..."
"jerry"," You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't 
              you?"
"jerry"," Newer magazines."
"george"," Jerry, I gotta talk to you."
"kramer"," Hi."
"kramer"," Got a minute?"
"kramer"," Sure."
"kramer"," Hi."
"elaine"," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah 
              blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, 
              bleh bleh bleh...."
"elaine"," Again you are telling me to shut up?"
"elaine"," You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not 
              getting the baby."
"elaine"," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll 
              make sure that it all gets worked out."
"elaine"," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling."
"jerry","  Oh, are you about done?"
"jerry"," Huh?"
"jerry"," What about all your Jewish jokes?"
"jerry"," The Jews?"
"jerry"," Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?"
"kramer"," So, I'll uh... all right. "
"jerry"," Date with Karen?"
"kramer"," No, Julie. She's the one."
"jerry"," What happened to Karen?"
"kramer"," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know 
              her parents are little people?"
"jerry"," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people 
              children?"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, 
              Jerry."
"jerry"," So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It 
              got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got 
              all offended. Those people can be so touchy."
"kramer"," Those people, listen to yourself."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," You think that dentists are so different from me and you? 
              They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of 
              a dream."
"jerry"," Kramer, he's just a dentist."
"kramer"," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."
"jerry"," I am not an anti-dentite!"
"kramer"," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes 
              and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're 
              saying they should have their own schools."
"jerry"," They do have their own schools!"
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"elaine"," One little baby, whatever you have in stock."
"elaine"," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. 
              Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun 
              way."
"jerry"," Well, what's wrong?"
"jerry"," Talk to me."
"jerry"," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody."
"jerry"," Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about 
              Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on."
"jerry"," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big 
              hug. "
"jerry"," I'm kinda in the middle of something."
"jerry"," Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart."
"elaine"," Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?"
"jerry"," Beth and Arnie broke up."
"elaine"," So they don't want a baby?"
"jerry","  Pff."
"elaine","  I think I'm gonna be sick. "
"jerry"," Hey, where's Marcy?"
"george"," She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, 
              yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. "
"jerry"," Hey, Kramer, over here."
"kramer"," I just assume not sit next to you."
"jerry"," Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents."
"elaine"," Nice looking family."
"jerry"," Very handsome."
"kramer","  How ya doing?"
"jerry"," Hi, Mr. Abbott."
"jerry"," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all 
              out of proportion."
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," That's a good one. Dentists."
"elaine"," Where's Beth?"
"jerry"," She went out to get her head shaved."
"jerry"," Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out."
"jerry"," Hang on just let me pick up a paper."
"george"," Yeah. No problem."
"jerry"," Let's go."
"george"," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag."
"jerry"," For how long?"
"george"," I'm sure he'll be back in a second."
"jerry"," Come on."
"george"," Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?"
"george"," Where are you going?"
"jerry"," I'm going to be this guy's friend."
"jerry"," New clothes?"
"george"," Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping.  Can I borrow your menu?"
"jerry"," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks 
              of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!"
"george"," The guy never came back."
"jerry"," He asked you to watch them not wear them."
"george"," I'm still watching them."
"jerry"," You look like a tourist."
"george"," All right, let me ask you something When do you start 
              to worry about ear hair?"
"jerry"," When you hear like a soft russeling."
"george"," It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, 
              knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do 
              you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting 
              there."
"jerry"," Oh right, the new job, how is it?"
"george"," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm."
"jerry"," So who's the new you?"
"george"," They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name 
              is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school."
"jerry"," Oh hi Alex."
"jerry"," No."
"george"," Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the 
              bus at the port authority?"
"jerry"," Right here, George. In here.  Try 
              opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world."
"george"," Thanks. Thanks a lot."
"kramer"," Hey."
"elaine"," Hey."
"kramer"," Hi."
"elaine"," Where's Jerry?"
"kramer"," Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?"
"elaine"," No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you."
"kramer"," Well let's sit down."
"elaine"," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling 
              Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to 
              you?"
"kramer"," Vaguely."
"elaine"," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, 
              I put them in the book anyway."
"kramer"," You put my life's stories in his autobiography?"
"elaine"," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter."
"kramer"," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. 
              I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman."
"elaine"," He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon."
"kramer"," Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh."
"kramer"," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks."
"jerry","  Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this."
"kramer"," All right, let's go."
"elaine"," Mr. Lippman, how are you?"
"elaine"," What are you doing here?"
"elaine"," Oh."
"kramer"," Hey buddy. Remember me?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?"
"kramer"," I'm the real Peterman."
"kramer"," Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat 
              and giggley."
"elaine"," That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps."
"elaine"," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, 
              it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of  does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million 
              dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops."
"kramer"," I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're 
              hurting my elbow."
"george"," Well actually I'm..."
"george"," Little Rock, Arkensas."
"jerry"," Hmm. That looks new."
"kramer"," So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject 
              me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac."
"jerry","  Yeah that's too bad."
"kramer"," What's the matter with you?"
"jerry","  Nothing."
"kramer"," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's 
              wrong. What is it."
"jerry"," I did something stupid."
"kramer"," What did you do?"
"jerry"," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest 
              hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew,  Gone."
"kramer"," Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down 
              there."
"jerry"," Well women do it."
"kramer","  ""Well women do it."" I'll 
              tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you 
              can just  sashey your pretty little self around 
              the town square."
"jerry"," Well what am I going to tell Alex?"
"kramer"," Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. 
              You hear me?"
"jerry"," Um hum."
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest."
"jerry"," Hey!"
"kramer"," I forgot. Wait. Never mind. "
"jerry"," You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. 
              I mean it's hard enough..."
"jerry"," Really?"
"elaine"," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?"
"elaine"," Mr Lippman?"
"jerry"," So you're pretending to be a tourist?"
"george"," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around 
              here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town 
              visiting so there's no messy breakup"
"jerry"," How do you explain your apartment?"
"george"," I got a hotel room."
"jerry"," you moved into a hotel?"
"george"," Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going 
              to stay?"
"jerry"," So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for 
              this hairless dog."
"george"," So?"
"jerry"," So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not 
              another."
"george"," Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?"
"jerry"," Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those 
              low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest."
"kramer","  Hey Jerry."
"kramer","  I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check 
              it out. Hahaha."
"george"," Reality tour?"
"jerry"," The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is 
              reality."
"elaine"," This was my idea you stole my idea."
"elaine"," Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is 
              my air and my idea."
"elaine"," Peach."
"george"," Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation."
"george"," Willie. Yeah."
"george"," Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?"
"jerry"," You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you 
              all the time now."
"george"," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* 
              town."
"jerry"," What is it she think you can't do?"
"george"," Find a job. Get an apartment."
"jerry"," How did you do those things?"
"george"," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. 
              You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life 
              and condense it down into one day, it looks decent."
"jerry"," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?"
"kramer"," Here you go, here you go, check it out."
"jerry"," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused."
"kramer"," Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the 
              stories behind the stories."
"jerry"," Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally 
              unknown person's life."
"kramer"," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and 
              desert."
"george"," What's desert?"
"kramer"," Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman 
              eats."
"george"," He eats those?"
"kramer"," No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman."
"george"," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography 
              is not. Now, you Kramer are real. "
"kramer"," Talk to me."
"george"," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is 
              real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real 
              in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman 
              which is you."
"kramer"," Understand?"
"jerry"," Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers."
"elaine"," So? What do you want me to do about it?"
"elaine"," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, 
              I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you 
              in that paper hat and that aprin..."
"elaine"," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin 
              tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the 
              top, toss the stump. Taste."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen."
"elaine"," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation 
              point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"""
"kramer"," Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?"
"jerry"," What? Can't I get a moment's peace?"
"kramer"," What are you doing to yourself?"
"jerry"," I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. "
"kramer"," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to 
              happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and 
              fuller and darker."
"jerry"," Oh that's an old wives tale."
"kramer"," Is it? Look at this."
"kramer","  Look at it! Look at it! And it's all 
              me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard."
"jerry"," Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen 
              to me."
"kramer"," Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?"
"elaine"," Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up."
"elaine"," Oh, hi."
"elaine"," You been enjoying them?"
"elaine"," Well they're perfectly edible."
"elaine"," If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have 
              to eat them."
"elaine"," Fine."
"elaine"," We were just trying to help."
"elaine"," I think I might."
"george"," $2300."
"george"," Yeah."
"george"," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. 
              Wait till you see the plum job that I landed."
"kramer"," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just 
              make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken 
              wire."
"kramer","  Well that's your opinion."
"kramer"," Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere."
"kramer"," Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left 
              on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at 
              the same time."
"jerry"," Why do I have to go on the tour?"
"kramer"," Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, 
              it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and 
              I'll only charge to 60 bucks."
"jerry"," Hey, how's business?"
"elaine"," Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department 
              won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff 
              until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps."
"kramer"," All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the 
              bus."
"elaine"," Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"elaine"," You got any room on that thing?"
"kramer"," Yeah there are a few seats still available."
"elaine"," Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll 
              make it worth your while."
"kramer"," Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back."
"elaine"," No they don't."
"kramer"," Are they war veterans?"
"george"," Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... "
"george"," Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner."
"jerry"," You also shouldn't use a donut."
"kramer"," All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman 
              Reality Tour..."
"jerry"," Can we just go?"
"kramer"," And go we will."
"kramer"," We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling 
              muffin stumps to the local repository."
"kramer"," And we're off."
"jerry"," You know I never though he would be able to recreate the 
              experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close."
"kramer"," I was going to dump this."
"kramer"," Well it's muffin stumps"
"kramer"," This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it."
"kramer"," Is this a joke?"
"jerry"," What's that?"
"jerry"," Oh. Yeah. "
"kramer","  Well maybe I will take 
              it up with Consumer Affairs."
"kramer","  I don't know.  Uh, 
              no more questions."
"george"," Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink."
"george"," What clothes?"
"jerry","  Kramer how much longer? 
              My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I 
              can't let her see me scratch it."
"kramer"," Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump."
"jerry"," I'm telling you man, I'm losing it."
"jerry"," I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with 
              that dog."
"kramer"," I don't know where the tops are. "
"kramer"," Jerry what's the matter?"
"jerry","  Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good."
"george","  Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes 
              down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's 
              room on 43rd street in my underpants."
"elaine"," They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away."
"newman"," Hello Elaine. Where are they?"
"elaine"," In the back."
"newman"," All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass."
"newman"," If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, 
              we have a situation here and time is of the essence."
"george"," What is Holland?"
"george"," No, that's the Netherlands."
"jerry"," Holland *is* the Netherlands."
"george"," Then who are the Dutch?"
"george"," I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn 
              star."
"jerry"," I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation."
"george"," Well why didn't we?"
"jerry"," Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation 
              from"
"george"," What if we grew muttonchops?"
"jerry"," No."
"george"," Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!"
"jerry"," Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a 
              job."
"george"," Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?"
"jerry"," No more crutches, that must be a relief."
"george"," Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions."
"jerry"," Not with a cane?"
"george"," Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's 
              a sad story. "
"jerry"," Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. 
              Some guy"
"george"," Alright, we're back in!"
"jerry"," We? No."
"jerry"," Killed?"
"george"," Killed."
"jerry"," Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like 
              that fish"
"george"," And you're the shark?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs."
"george"," I don't know how a fish could eat laughs."
"jerry"," Well, I'm glad I brought it up."
"kramer"," Got any shredded coconut?"
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah, right. "
"george"," Oh my god."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon."
"jerry"," So what's this job?"
"george"," Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports."
"jerry"," Knicks? Rangers?"
"george"," Playground equipment."
"jerry"," Welcome back to the show."
"kramer"," Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection."
"jerry"," What kind do you use?"
"kramer"," Whatever you get."
"kramer"," Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe."

"kramer"," She's dating him again, huh?"
"jerry"," Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the 
              top of the"
"kramer"," Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home 
              in a body"
"elaine"," We have to break up."
"elaine"," I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting 
              the"
"elaine"," Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are 
              through!"
"elaine"," Fine!"
"kramer"," Hey, what are you doing?"
"jerry"," Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched 
              the floor of a"
"kramer"," Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the 
              Internet he"
"jerry"," He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. 
              He's a time"
"kramer"," Well, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a 
              stick of"
"jerry"," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute."
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," Do I have to ask?"
"kramer"," I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything 
              else, Mr. Nosy?"
"jerry"," Why are you buttering your face?"
"kramer"," I'm shaving with it."
"jerry"," Oh Moses smell the roses."
"kramer"," Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. 
              Now feel"
"jerry"," No."
"kramer"," Feel it."
"jerry"," I don't want to."
"kramer"," Feel it. Feel it."
"george"," I got the job?"
"george"," Handicap?  I'm not handicapped."
"george"," Yeah, I didn't mean that."
"george"," When do I start?"
"george"," Yeah, what the hell."
"jerry"," You got the job?"
"george"," Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They 
              treat me so"
"jerry"," Hold on, they think you're handicapped?"
"george"," Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the 
              bathroom"
"jerry"," How can you do this?"
"george"," Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm 
              just now"
"jerry"," He drove a car with no arms?"
"george"," Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest 
              is true. He"
"jerry"," Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I 
              know you?"
"george"," I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. 
              I feel like a"
"kramer"," They hooked me up."
"george"," What's with all the butter?"
"kramer"," I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?"
"jerry"," You can eat it?"
"kramer"," No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my 
              body."
"jerry"," Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna."
"george"," Who?"
"jerry"," The tooth brush in the toilet bowl."
"jerry"," I don't believe this."
"george"," You miss her, don't you?"
"jerry"," No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything 
              off me,"
"george"," You miss her."
"elaine"," You missed quite a performance."
"jerry"," Someone's cooking."
"newman"," Hello, Jerry."
"jerry"," Hello, Newman."
"newman"," You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf 
              between us and"
"newman"," Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's 
              got something"
"jerry"," No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter 
              - pause - Oh"
"newman"," Butter?"
"elaine"," By making time with some floozy across the aisle?"
"elaine"," This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me."
"elaine"," Well maybe I feel the same way."
"elaine"," Ok, so now what?"
"jerry"," Kramer!"
"kramer"," Oh, man. I think I cooked myself."
"jerry"," Look at your skin."
"kramer"," Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
"kramer"," I'm fried."
"jerry"," Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for 
              that?"
"kramer"," Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
"jerry"," Is that what the doctor said?"
"kramer"," No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine."
"jerry"," Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with 
              you?"
"george"," No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because 
              I sprained my"
"jerry"," What happened?"
"george"," Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --"
"jerry"," Oh no, not you too?"
"george"," I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and..."
"jerry"," You know what's good for that? Relish."
"jerry"," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! 
              No!!! "
"george"," So what, he's got a couple of good jokes."
"jerry"," Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? 
              Shopping"
"george"," That's true, that always happens to me."
"jerry"," You think that's funny?"
"george"," I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about 
              too much."
"jerry"," You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!"
"george"," maybe I am."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
"george"," Puke! That's a funny word. Puke.  puke! Don't 
              have to"
"elaine"," I can't believe we broke up like that."
"elaine"," Do you want something to read?"
"elaine"," Well, are you going to take a nap or --"
"elaine"," You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a 
              seat?"
"elaine"," That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing 
              has"
"elaine"," Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable 
              lasagna"
"elaine"," Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and 
              we just ram"
"newman"," How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here."
"kramer"," Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy."
"newman"," The smell. It's still with you, huh?"
"kramer"," Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up 
              so it melts."
"kramer"," Ahh, now I'm simmering."
"newman"," I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
"george"," Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up."
"george"," That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, 
              when we"
"george"," See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?"
"george"," Well, you're not gonna believe what happened."
"jerry"," You mugged Stephen Hawking?"
"george"," Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal 
              Rascal,"
"jerry"," Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight 
              to hell at"
"jerry"," Hello?"
"elaine"," Jerry."
"jerry"," Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?"
"elaine"," Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!"
"jerry"," Who's that?"
"elaine"," It's Vegetable Lasagna."
"jerry"," Who?"
"elaine"," Vegetable Lasagna!"
"elaine"," Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!"
"jerry"," Get me some duty free Kahlua."
"george"," How's the trip?"
"jerry"," Sounded good."
"jerry"," Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by 
              the big showcase"
"george"," Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?"
"jerry"," That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little 
              off."
"george"," What are you talking about? You're not!"
"jerry"," That's right, I'm taking a dive."
"george"," You're throwing the set?"
"jerry"," I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without 
              all the"
"george"," Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. 
              My"
"jerry"," We're four months apart."
"george"," nevertheless. His time has come."
"george"," Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, 
              I'll be on my"
"newman"," Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer."
"kramer"," What are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw 
              your set?"
"jerry"," That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without 
              the cushy"
"jerry"," If you'll excuse me."
"jerry"," What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, 
              why do you want"
"jerry"," And what's with people getting sick?"
"newman"," Hee hee! Yeah yeah!"
"jerry"," I mean, what's the deal with cancer?"
"kramer"," Oh, tough crowd."
"george"," Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor."
"george"," Oh yeah?"
"kramer"," You didn't do so bad."
"jerry"," What are you talking about? I bombed!"
"kramer"," No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, 
              it was not"
"jerry"," Like who?"
"kramer"," Like that guy who yelled out."
"jerry"," He had cancer!"
"kramer"," And laughter is the best medicine."
"jerry"," Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you."
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big 
              turkey out"
"kramer"," A big fat turkey."
"newman"," I'm sorry I missed that."
"kramer"," He worked so hard and then he just--"
"kramer"," What is this, oregano?"
"kramer"," Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and 
              it's sticking"
"newman"," Here. Hold this."
"kramer"," What is this, parsley?"
"jerry"," Ah, the sweet stench of failure."
"kramer"," Get off of me, get off of me!"
"george"," Are you a religious man, sir?"
"jerry"," Ouch."
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
"elaine"," David, this has been the worst month of my life and if 
              I never see you"
"elaine"," Oh that's origi-"
"elaine"," 86th and Broadway please."
"elaine"," Oh no."
"elaine"," Noooooooooooo!"
"george"," Ive 
              had my difficulties. "
"george"," Mr. Thomassoulo 
              during times of great stress, people are capable of super human 
              strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?"
"george"," How about 
              the old Spider Man live action show?"
"george"," I dont 
              understand."
"george"," Clearer"
"jerry"," So youre 
              staying at Play Now?"
"george"," Why not? 
              Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped 
              toilets in the city."
"jerry"," But they 
              not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?"
"george"," Theyre 
              the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. 
              As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me."
"elaine"," Hey"
"george"," Hello-o-o-o 
              Elaine!"
"elaine"," Whats 
              that?"
"jerry"," Oh, its 
              just this stupid thing. "
"elaine"," Well, 
              Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?"
"jerry","  No-o-o-o."
"george","  Not at all."
"elaine"," Tell me!"
"jerry"," All right. 
              You know this girl Clare I am seeing? "
"elaine"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Well, he 
              and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays 
              awake all night and talks to me."
"elaine"," How is 
              it talking?"
"jerry"," Well, her 
              belly button is like a mouth.  Im bored. 
              Talk to me."
"elaine"," Oh I gotta 
              start taking these ""stupid"" warnings more seriously."
"jerry"," Hey, look 
              whose here - Puddy. "
"elaine"," My Puddy? 
              But we broke up."
"jerry"," And yet 
              he continues to live."
"elaine"," Im 
              doing great. "
"jerry"," Well, thats 
              it. You two are back together."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," The bump 
              into. The bump into always leads to the backslide."
"elaine"," David 
              and I <i>will</i> not be getting back together. "
"jerry"," Elaine, 
              breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant 
              do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, 
              and then it goes over."
"george"," Thats 
              beautiful."
"elaine"," What about 
              you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that."
"jerry"," Thats 
              different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, 
              youll backslide"
"elaine"," You want 
              to bet?"
"jerry"," Stakes?"
"elaine"," 50"
"jerry"," Dollars?"
"elaine"," All right. 
              Witness? ."
"george"," Witness."
"jerry"," Done."
"george"," Percentage?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," I went 
              to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled 
              a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of 
              the urinal. So thats it!"
"jerry"," Oh yes, 
              quite."
"kramer"," Hello!"
"jerry"," Of course 
              its a sliding scale."
"jerry","  La la la."
"kramer","  La la la."
"kramer"," Look at 
              this, they are redoing the Cloud Club."
"jerry"," Oh, that 
              restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a 
              good idea."
"kramer"," Of course 
              its a good idea, its <i>my</i> idea. I conceived this 
              whole project two years ago."
"jerry"," Which part? 
              The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending 
              the two hundred million you dont have part?"
"kramer"," You see 
              I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing 
              happens. You know why?"
"jerry"," No resources, 
              no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains."
"kramer","  
              No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, 
              grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any 
              idea how much time I waste in this apartment?"
"jerry"," I can ball 
              park it."
"elaine","  Hello-o-o-o!"
"kramer"," Here we 
              go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!"
"jerry"," Hey, I 
              called you last night, where were you?"
"elaine","  I went out with a  a friend."
"jerry"," George?"
"elaine","  No, nono."
"jerry"," Well, I 
              was here, thats everyone ."
"elaine"," ."
"jerry"," Are those 
              the same shoes as yesterday?"
"elaine"," Oh, you 
              know I wear these shoes all the time. "
"jerry"," Your hair, 
              its somewhat de-poofed. "
"elaine"," Its 
              the new look. You know Heroin Cheek? "
"jerry"," Wait a 
              second, whats going on here?"
"elaine"," Nothing, 
              nothing. "
"jerry"," ."
"elaine"," ."
"jerry"," Youre 
              wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!!  You saw Puddy!"
"kramer"," Hoochie 
              moochie. "
"jerry"," Hand it 
              over. Pay up."
"elaine"," No! Its 
              an isolated, sexual incident. We are <i>not</i> back together!"
"jerry"," Then what 
              do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and 
              have sex. This isnt cinemax."
"elaine"," It was 
              no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed 
              a little dinner. "
"jerry"," Ah, dinner! 
              Thats it, youre all the way back!"
"elaine"," Ugh!"
"jerry"," Sex, thats 
              meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. 
              Thats like an hour."
"kramer","  Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun 
              . That was my idea too!"
"george"," Good Morning!"
"george"," Hi Allison, 
              thats a nice dress."
"george"," Hey Glenn!"
"george"," Heard 
              that one already."
"kramer"," So 
              thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, 
              you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead 
              and look through some of the drawers. "
"jerry"," And you 
              are?"
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont 
              you go across the hall and get started on that mail."
"kramer"," Hes 
              a go getter!"
"jerry"," Whos 
              he? "
"kramer"," My intern 
              from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries."
"jerry"," Alright."
"kramer"," Well, 
              apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting 
              some real world corporate experience. "
"jerry"," But you 
              only provide fantasy world corporate experience."
"kramer"," Well, 
              this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important 
              things, like my bladder system."
"jerry"," Alright, 
              its time to go. "
"kramer"," Jerry, 
              its not for people, its for oil tankers."
"jerry","  
              I know!"
"kramer"," You see 
              the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, 
              the oil wont spill out."
"jerry"," Actually, 
              that is not a bad idea."
"kramer","  
              yeah."
"jerry"," Now, its 
              time to go."
"jerry"," Hello"
"george","  Hello-o-o-o. ."
"jerry","  Hello-o-o-o.  So, whats going on?"
"george","   Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve 
              downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers 
           last days here."
"jerry"," So, are 
              you going to leave?"
"george"," Oh no! 
              Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like 
              a weed, Jerry."
"jerry"," I thought 
              youre like Hitler in the bunker?"
"george"," Im 
              a weed in Hitlers bunker."
"jerry"," Im 
              getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.  Im getting another call, see ya Hello!"
"jerry","  Really? When?"
"jerry"," No, I dont."
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              5."
"elaine"," Hey!"
"jerry"," Hey! So, 
              wheres my money?"
"elaine"," No money, 
              I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?"
"jerry"," Oh yeah, 
              hold on."
"jerry"," Hello Darren, 
              this is Jerry from Jerrys office. . 
              Were going to be three for lunch.  What do you mean hes already left?"
"jerry"," Hey, Elaine 
              is going to come with us, alright?"
"kramer"," What? 
              When did this happen?"
"jerry"," Well, just"
"kramer","  
              DARREN!"
"elaine"," I am <i>not</i> 
              calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them 
              over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, 
              I better not. Ill call.  Oh, look at that! 
              There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. 
              Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really 
              really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. ."
"george"," Well, 
              Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. 
              They tried to sweat me out."
"jerry"," Do you 
              have to write <i>all</i> this stuff down."
"jerry"," So, how 
              hot did it get?"
"george"," I dont 
              know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 
              hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. "
"jerry"," I guess 
              you can take anything, but actual work."
"george"," Bring 
              it on!"
"george","  Hello-o-o-o Kramer!"
"jerry","  Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!"
"george","  La la la."
"kramer"," Sorry 
              I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? "
"kramer"," Uh huh"
"george","  
              And I still say hes naked under there!"
"jerry"," Oh that 
              makes a lot of sense."
"george"," Oh, shut 
              up!"
"jerry"," "
"jerry"," Oh, nothing. 
              "
"jerry"," Oh all 
              right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing 
              this silly, dumb voice."
"jerry"," No, its 
              not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, 
              booming, jovial voice.  Hello-o-o-o."
"jerry"," No its"
"jerry"," Hey, were 
              kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back 
              later?"
"jerry","  
              GET OUT!"
"jerry"," No body 
              said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade 
              guy."
"jerry"," No, hes 
              just a little bloated."
"jerry"," Its 
              mostly water weight."
"kramer"," Boysenberry, 
              the kid is still learning."
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              well nothing before noon."
"jerry"," Line two?"
"kramer"," Yeah, 
              your phone is line one."
"jerry"," Oh"
"elaine"," See, this 
              is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. 
              We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are 
              back together."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," Well, 
              either way"
"elaine"," David"
"elaine"," Alright 
              thats it! Were back together!"
"elaine"," Oh, yeah."
"elaine"," Get those 
              clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were 
              going to cuddle."
"elaine"," You heard 
              me. Strip!"
"george"," ..AlrightOK."
"george","  Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are 
              you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message 
              for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him  IM IN 
              MY OFFICE! Thanks."
"kramer"," Dean Jones, 
              you wanting to talk to me?"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," I know 
              it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica. 
              "
"kramer"," And with 
              Darrens help, well get that chicken."
"kramer"," Well, 
              I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary."
"jerry"," So youre 
              sure youre not still angry about last night?"
"jerry"," Never?"
"jerry"," What about 
              if youre not around?"
"jerry"," So I have 
              to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?"
"jerry"," I can do 
              that."
"jerry"," I dont 
              know."
"jerry","  Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. "
"george"," You broke 
              up with her? Why?"
"jerry"," So we could 
              do the voice.  La-la-la. Whats the matter?"
"george"," I think 
              Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? 
              La-la-la?"
"jerry"," No, it 
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              can do anything. It can be Spanish.  Hola. Hello-o-o-o."
"george"," I think 
              I like the girl better than the voice."
"jerry"," Really?"
"jerry","  Hello-o-o-o."
"elaine"," Still?"
"george"," I told 
              you."
"elaine"," Alright, 
              here you go, choke on it ."
"jerry"," See, never 
              bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together."
"elaine"," Yeah, 
              well not for long. Im breaking up with him."
"jerry"," No, I dont 
              think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. 
              Its kismet."
"elaine"," Double 
              or nothing."
"jerry"," Done."
"george","  Witness?"
"jerry"," Youre 
              in there again. "
"george"," I think 
              Play Now is putting something in my food."
"elaine"," Alright, 
              Im out of here."
"jerry"," What is 
              this? ."
"kramer"," I dont 
              know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent 
              been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. 
              Im clueless.  Is that clock right?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Nine 
              oclock."
"kramer"," I was 
              supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago."
"jerry","  Good-bye Kramer."
"kramer"," Jerry, 
              buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played."
"jerry"," Really?"
"kramer"," So played."
"george"," I told 
              you."
"kramer"," Darren? 
              What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship."
"kramer"," Kramerica 
              is no more."
"kramer"," Probably. 
              Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica."
"kramer"," Well, 
              youre still here?"
"kramer"," Well, 
              I havent changed my mind."
"kramer"," Well, 
              you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica 
              industries lives! Lets get back to work!"
"kramer"," Lets 
              see what Jerry has to eat."
"george"," You see 
              if I stay the whole year, I get it all."
"george"," Well played."
"jerry","  Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our 
              relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. 
              Hold on one second.  So 
              we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore?  Alright, were back together again, great. Bye 
              bye."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Trouble 
              down at the plant?"
"kramer"," Its 
              a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder 
              system."
"george"," You have 
              to drink that whole thing?"
"kramer"," No. No. 
              No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort 
              of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or 
              not it can restrain the impact."
"jerry"," I understand 
              ."
"george"," Would 
              a giant rubber ball work?"
"kramer"," Conceivably."
"george"," Well, 
              Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont 
              we test your bladder system at my office?"
"jerry"," Youre 
              not"
"george"," Oh, yes 
              I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing 
              dirtier than a giant ball of oil."
"elaine"," I dont 
              think so David, were through."
"elaine"," Whew that 
              was a dozy."
"jerry"," Go again?"
"elaine"," Book it."
"george","  Witness."
"elaine"," David 
              I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be ."
"jerry"," Ha ha ha. 
              Ha ha ha ha. "
"elaine"," Im 
              going to get some popcorn. "
"elaine"," So, how 
              did it end?"
"jerry"," They got 
              away."
"elaine"," uh."
"elaine"," Listen 
              David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?"
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," Did you 
              bring the video camera?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I 
              put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, 
              and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya."
"george"," Oh, you 
              might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong 
              man to hire because he was fake handicapped."
"jerry"," I cant. 
              I got to meet Clare."
"kramer"," You gave 
              up the voice?"
"jerry"," Yeah, I 
              thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again."
"jerry"," Darren?"
"jerry"," Uh, bathroom."
"george"," Hey, use 
              mine. Ill let you in."
"jerry"," I thought 
              it was open to the public."
"george"," I uh, 
              took care of that."
"jerry"," Wow! Zanadu 
              . No wonder youre putting in so many hours.  
              May I?"
"george"," I insist. 
              Ill fix us a drink.  
              I got it."
"kramer"," Whew. 
              You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago 
              that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds 
              energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now 
              lets push this giant ball of oil out the window."
"george"," So, check 
              out my view."
"jerry"," Wow! Hey, 
              theres Clare. I better go down."
"george"," Hey, theres 
              Kramer &amp; Darren."
"jerry"," Theres 
              the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. 
              Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!"
"kramer"," Bombs 
              away ."
"jerry"," This is 
              going to be a shame."
"george"," Hello."
"kramer"," Well, 
              that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard 
              in the same bottle? "
"kramer"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Clare won 
              her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. 
              I guess youre not going in anymore. "
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," So theyre 
              not paying you your"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," So youre 
              pretty much"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What ever 
              happened to Darren?"
"kramer"," Darren 
              is going away for a long long time. "
"jerry"," So Clare 
              sure looked real funny covered in oil like that  Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil"
"george","  Im slippery as an eel"
"kramer","  La la la."
"jerry"," Im 
              just so glad its back."
"elaine"," See, this 
              is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling 
              ourselves. We belong together."
"elaine"," Ah nuts!"
"george"," All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit"
"george"," What is that? "
"george"," Are you supposed to yell it? "
"george"," What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? "
"jerry"," Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener."
"jerry"," What? All right, fine."
"jerry"," No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is."
"jerry"," I get peeved. "
"jerry"," Miffed. "
"jerry"," Irked? "
"george"," Why does she want you to be mad? "
"jerry"," She says I suppress my emotions. "
"george"," So what do you care what she thinks. "
"jerry"," Good body. "
"george"," She probably gets that impression because you're cool."
"jerry"," But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell. "
"george"," Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic"
"kramer"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all 
              my food."
"kramer","  What is that, a new bit? "
"george"," I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help 
              me fix"
"jerry"," Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx. "
"kramer"," I'll do it. "
"george"," Really? You wanna come? "
"kramer"," Yeah, I love going to the country. "
"elaine"," Where are they goin'?"
"jerry"," Fix a screen door in Queens."
"elaine","  That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' 
              Saturday"
"jerry"," Not goin' to the Knick game."
"elaine"," I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar 
              Mitzvah."
"jerry"," You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. 
              You"
"elaine","  Oh, I don't think that's possible."
"kramer","  Get in a little closer. I can't see the 
              screen"
"george"," Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind 
              keeps"
"kramer"," It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked"
"kramer"," Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. "
"george"," Dad, what's all this?"
"george"," You're selling computers?"
"george"," Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and"
"jerry"," Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk! "
"jerry"," 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass! "
"jerry"," You're damn right you're not buying it! "
"jerry"," I'm open. There's just nothing in there. "
"jerry"," Oh, you think I'm lying about this? "
"jerry"," Well, I'm not. "
"jerry"," Oh, stop it. "
"jerry"," That's enough! "
"jerry"," Really? It felt good. "
"elaine"," Congratulations, Mr. Lippman. "
"elaine"," Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses"
"jerry"," Tongue? "
"elaine"," Yeah. "
"george"," Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23. "
"jerry"," Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man. "
"elaine"," And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations 
              to six"
"jerry"," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not 
              want to"
"elaine"," Where did that come from? "
"jerry"," Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that? 
            "
"elaine"," No. "
"jerry"," Good. "
"george"," All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's"
"jerry"," What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel 
              cage"
"george"," Kramer. "
"kramer"," Yeah. "
"george"," What-what are you doing? "
"kramer"," Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got 
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              a"
"jerry"," What do you need it for? "
"kramer","  The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. 
              Let's see"
"george"," Morning, ma. "
"george"," Morning, dad. "
"george"," What is Lloyd Braun doing here? "
"george"," Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing 
              up"
"george","  What is this? "
"elaine"," So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology"
"elaine"," Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and"
"elaine"," I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and 
              I am"
"elaine"," No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become 
              a"
"elaine","  Walnuts, mmmmmm. "
"george"," You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit! "
"george"," You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell"
"elaine"," Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your"
"elaine"," Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried. "
"elaine"," Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts"
"jerry","  Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer"
"kramer","  Hello, neighbor. "
"jerry"," Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely. "
"kramer"," Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to. "
"jerry"," You barbecuing tonight? "
"kramer","  Right after the fireworks. "
"jerry"," So, where do you want to eat tonight? "
"jerry"," Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? "
"jerry"," Well, I don't think more flan is the answer! "
"jerry"," 'Maybe'!? "
"jerry"," Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,"
"kramer"," Hey, buddy! "
"elaine","  Hey. Happy New Year! "
"elaine"," Did you and Patty just break up? "
"jerry"," Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to 
              talk about"
"elaine"," Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard"
"jerry"," That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there 
              also,"
"elaine"," Whoa. What is the matter? "
"jerry"," It's Patty. "
"elaine"," Jerry, you break up with a girl every week. "
"jerry","  What--what is this salty discharge? "
"elaine"," Oh my God. You're crying. "
"jerry"," This is horrible! I care! "
"jerry"," Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without 
              her. "
"kramer"," She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? "
"jerry"," I don't know what's happening to me. "
"kramer"," Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come"
"jerry"," That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. "
"kramer"," Yeah, well, she... had one, too. "
"george"," Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's"
"kramer","  That's it, that's 
              it! I"
"george","  Are you still down 
              in"
"jerry"," You ever heard of a little thing called feelings? "
"george"," Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!"
"jerry"," Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. 
              Ever"
"george"," What? "
"jerry"," I love you, George. Come here. "
"george"," I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?"
"jerry"," Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you. "
"kramer"," Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn 
              my back"
"jerry"," Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer! "
"kramer"," I love you, too, buddy, and George-- "
"george"," I don't want to hear it, Kramer! "
"kramer"," Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn 
              this"
"george"," What signal? What-what signal? "
"kramer"," I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!' "
"george"," If I do it, will you buy a computer? "
"kramer"," On the signal, George. On the signal. "
"george"," Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. "
"jerry"," I love you, Costanza. "
"george"," Will you shut up?! "
"kramer"," Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the"
"elaine"," So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. "
"george"," Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa. "
"elaine"," What? "
"george"," It means a non-Jewish woman. "
"elaine"," I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have 
              to"
"george"," You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of"
"elaine"," Oh, that's insane. "
"george"," I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get 
              you"
"elaine"," I am not buying a computer from you. "
"george"," There's porn. "
"elaine","  Even so. "
"george"," Damn it! "
"elaine"," Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that"
"elaine"," If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me. 
            "
"elaine"," Oh, no. Don't! "
"elaine"," Oy vey! "
"jerry"," What happened to you, pal? "
"kramer"," Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They"
"jerry"," Are you all right? "
"kramer"," Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity 
              now."
"jerry"," So, you're using Frank's relaxation method? "
"kramer"," Serenity! "
"elaine"," Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is"
"jerry"," Sit down, Elaine. "
"elaine"," Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing. "
"jerry"," I've been thinking about what it means to be complete. "
"elaine"," Do you have an apple or anything? "
"jerry"," Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble. 
            "
"elaine"," Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine. "
"jerry"," Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning... "
"elaine"," Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana! "
"jerry"," When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been 
              right in"
"elaine"," What? "
"jerry"," Elaine... "
"george","  
              Jerry,"
"jerry"," I'm asking Elaine to marry me. "
"jerry"," Elaine? "
"elaine"," Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman"
"jerry"," Lippman? "
"jerry"," Can I help you? "
"elaine"," No. Stay! Stay. Stay. "
"george"," What do you know? You were in the nut house. "
"george"," I heard they found a family in your freezer "
"jerry","  What happened here,"
"kramer"," Serenity now, serenity now... "
"jerry"," Kramer! "
"kramer"," Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,"
"jerry"," You don't look well. "
"kramer"," Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with 
              the"
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose. 
            "
"george"," Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun! "
"kramer","  Serenity now! "
"george"," Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers? "
"kramer","  Serenity nooooowwwww! "
"george"," Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls"
"kramer","  George, you listen to me. I owe ya one. "
"jerry"," He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it? "
"george"," Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't 
              handle"
"jerry"," George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've 
              ever done."
"george"," All right... here goes... "
"elaine"," Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this"
"elaine"," Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied"
"elaine","  Well, what does that have to do...? "
"george"," So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything 
              I'm"
"jerry"," Yikes. Well, good luck with all that. "
"george"," Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a"
"jerry"," I think you scared me straight. "
"elaine"," All right, Jerome, I'm in. "
"jerry"," What? "
"elaine"," Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is"
"jerry"," I tell ya, I don't see it happening. "
"elaine"," What? What happened to the new Jerry? "
"jerry"," He doesn't work here anymore. "
"elaine"," Oh, well that's just *great!* "
"george"," I love you, Jerry. "
"george"," You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the"
"elaine"," Well, that's because you're an idiot. "
"george"," Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? "
"george"," Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff. 
            "
"george"," 'Hoochie mama'? "
"jerry"," Are you sure you can't stay longer? "
"jerry"," He was 96 years old. "
"jerry"," Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out. "
"jerry"," Really? "
"kramer"," Hey, Seinfelds! "
"kramer"," How long are you staying? "
"kramer"," Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. 
        If he could go... "
"jerry"," Are you sure you don't need a hand with that? "
"jerry"," Did you give blood? "
"kramer"," No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. 
        Just in case. "
"jerry"," In case of what? "
"kramer"," Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts 
        to go down, I don't back off until it's finished. "
"jerry"," Are we finished? "
"kramer"," Done. "
"elaine"," Yeah... "
"elaine"," I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, 
        you know all lurchy and awkward. "
"elaine"," Tomorrow evening, sure. "
"elaine"," Do I know anyone?? "
"george"," What are you doing? "
"george"," Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything 
        I can do to lend support to the mood. "
"george"," Um, cream soda? "
"elaine"," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible? "
"jerry"," Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first 
        thing they ask is who's responsible for this? "
"elaine"," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around. 
      "
"jerry"," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? "
"george"," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell 
        drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. 
        We need some pudding here! Pudding! "
"elaine"," You just left? What did you tell her? "
"george"," I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another 
        hour. "
"jerry"," What? "
"george"," I don't know, I was starving Jerry! "
"george"," Oh, pudding! You want some? "
"jerry"," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? "
"george"," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding 
        needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it 
        on the stove. "
"jerry"," Elaine, what do you think? "
"elaine"," I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. 
      "
"kramer"," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your 
        hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood 
        elsewhere, yeah. "
"kramer"," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer 
        with...my money! "
"george"," So eh, what do you say? "
"george"," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, 
        your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... "
"george"," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 
        9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? "
"george"," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked! 
      "
"jerry"," Didn't go for it, huh? "
"george"," No. "
"jerry"," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured 
        meats? "
"george"," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, 
        it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's 
        only natural to combine them. "
"jerry"," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man 
        and a sandwich. "
"george"," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral. 
      "
"jerry"," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about 
        satisfying one of somebody else's. "
"george"," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin 
        from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto 
        knife. "
"jerry"," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification 
        program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. "
"george"," Well, I guess these would be out of the question.  "
"jerry"," What the hell is that? "
"george"," Pudding skin singles. "
"kramer"," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. "
"jerry"," Oh, why? "
"kramer"," I closed down my account at the blood bank. "
"jerry"," What, it...it's here in the building? "
"kramer"," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? "
"jerry"," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should 
        find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out. 
      "
"kramer"," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. "
"elaine"," Hey, working out? "
"jerry"," You know it and I ditched all my junk food. "
"kramer"," What the heck is going on here? "
"jerry"," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. "
"kramer"," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. "
"elaine"," Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her 
        mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other 
        someone. "
"jerry"," Is this about me? "
"elaine"," No. "
"jerry"," Oh, then I lost interest. "
"elaine"," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your 
        message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on... 
      "
"kramer"," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. 
         Well, somebody's baby-sitting. "
"elaine"," You? I'm more responsible than you are! "
"kramer"," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to 
        fill my freezer with my own blood. "
"george"," Oh, Tara! "
"kramer"," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. "
"elaine"," Kramer... "
"kramer"," Don't take my money! "
"elaine"," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, 
        I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. "
"kramer"," No, I'm the baby-sitter. "
"elaine"," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. "
"elaine"," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help 
        out... what's that, some raccoon or something... "
"elaine"," Hi Jimmy.  Ouch!  "
"jerry"," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting 
        at Vivian's. "
"kramer"," There was an incident. "
"jerry"," Oh no, where's the blood?  It's in here isn't 
        it? "
"kramer"," Would you stop it. "
"jerry"," What is this? "
"kramer"," It's Jell-O. "
"jerry"," What about this? This is blood isn't it?! "
"kramer"," This is tomato juice, look... "
"jerry"," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! "
"kramer"," Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He 
        let me put it in his meat freezer. "
"jerry"," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? "
"kramer"," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding 
        skin singles. They're delicious. "
"jerry"," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here 
        anymore... "
"kramer"," Heads up! "
"jerry"," Aaah... "
"elaine"," I wish I was dead. "
"elaine"," As long as you don't put... "
"elaine"," Thanks for the re-fill. "
"elaine"," Oh, he's...he's a joy... "
"elaine"," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. "
"elaine"," It's not serious, is it? "
"elaine"," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.  "
"jerry"," Aah! "
"kramer"," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. "
"jerry"," I can see that! What happened? "
"kramer"," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody 
        yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. "
"jerry"," I'll remember that. "
"kramer"," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood. 
      "
"jerry"," What? "
"kramer"," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. "
"george"," Three pints of Kramer's blood? "
"jerry"," I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood. 
      "
"george"," Well, so much for purification week. "
"jerry"," So, how's the fornicating gourmet? "
"george"," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg 
        and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that 
        would really be the ultimate. "
"jerry"," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. "
"elaine"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Hey, how was baby-sitting? "
"elaine"," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical 
        problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. "
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. "
"elaine"," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors 
        mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world. 
      "
"george"," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on 
        a baby-sitting gig. "
"jerry"," Really? "
"kramer"," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all 
        bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave 
        it for me, huh? "
"jerry"," I'm not touching that thing. "
"kramer"," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood 
        brother. "
"jerry"," Oh, no... "
"kramer"," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... "
"jerry"," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. "
"kramer"," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because 
        I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table! 
      "
"jerry"," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. "
"kramer"," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, 
        we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? "
"jerry"," Hello? "
"jerry"," Kramer called you? "
"jerry"," Yes, I'm fine. "
"jerry"," I don't need a personal trainer.  all right I've 
        got to go, we'll talk about this later. "
"jerry"," Why are you calling my parents? "
"kramer"," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, 
        is it all right if I watch a tape in here? "
"jerry"," Why here? "
"kramer"," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. "
"jerry"," Ok... "
"kramer"," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed 
        is really nice? "
"jerry"," Fine... "
"kramer"," Ok! "
"jerry"," No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! "
"kramer"," Blood! "
"jerry"," All right. "
"jerry"," Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? "
"elaine"," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. "
"elaine"," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then 
        eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running 
        around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you 
        I'm no good watching that kid. "
"elaine"," No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job 
        or keep a man! "
"elaine"," All right, but I'm running out of purses here.  "
"jerry"," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? "
"jerry"," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? "
"jerry"," For what? "
"jerry"," How many session did my parents paid for? "
"george"," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! "
"george"," And now for the trifecta.  "
"george"," Pleasuring you? "
"jerry"," What is this? "
"kramer"," We're making sausages. "
"jerry"," I thought you were gonna watch a video. "
"kramer"," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages. 
      "
"jerry"," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. "
"kramer"," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and 
        haul these beauties out of here. "
"jerry"," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter 
        house. "
"jerry"," No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... "
"jerry"," So, the free love buffet is over? "
"george"," I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami. 
      "
"jerry"," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session 
        with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. "
"jerry"," What's going on? "
"george"," I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. "
"jerry"," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food 
        and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. "
"george"," I think you're right. You gonna eat that? "
"jerry"," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. "
"elaine"," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major 
        inconvenience. "
"george"," These fries are really really good... "
"jerry"," All right, that's enough of that.  "
"elaine"," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to 
        Jimmy's birthday party. "
"george"," Uuh, sleepy. "
"elaine"," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid. 
      "
"jerry"," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you. 
      "
"elaine"," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel. "
"kramer"," Why did you get rid of that sausage? "
"jerry"," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum. "
"kramer"," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. 
        Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car? 
      "
"jerry"," What's wrong with yours? "
"kramer"," I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad. 
      "
"jerry"," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even! 
      "
"kramer"," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to 
        your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your 
        bed. "
"kramer"," Oh, man... ""If 
        the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, 
        I can't do that. "
"kramer"," Oh, mama... "
"kramer"," Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry. 
         "
"elaine"," Vivian... "
"elaine"," Hi! This is my friend George. "
"elaine"," I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy. "
"george"," Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her. 
      "
"george"," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents 
        in Redding Pennsylvania. "
"george"," Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to 
        Scotland. "
"george"," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the 
        Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. "
"george"," That's because it's underwater. "
"george"," Is it? "
"george"," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference. "
"george"," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? "
"george"," Very. "
"george"," Vivian!! "
"jerry"," Is this really necessary? "
"jerry"," What if I can't keep up? "
"jerry"," What's going on? "
"jerry"," Oh my God, the blood! "
"elaine"," So how long did they drag you? "
"jerry"," Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just 
        doggin' it. "
"elaine"," Hi George. Hi Jimmy. "
"george"," Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something. 
      "
"george"," Ouch! "
"jerry"," What's the kid doing here? "
"george"," I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't 
        make it. "
"jerry"," Oh, that's a drag... "
"kramer"," That kid... "
"jerry"," You put blood in the car?! "
"kramer"," Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that 
        thing. "
"jerry"," Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you 
        again. "
"kramer"," You didn't get the blood from me. "
"jerry"," Then who? "
"newman"," Hello Jerry. "
"jerry"," Aaaaahhh...!!! "
"jerry"," Why were you making gravel?"
"kramer"," Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.            "
"jerry"," Of course. It's garbage."
"kramer"," No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, 
              this is the set from the old Merv Griffin "
"jerry"," Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian."
"kramer"," Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on 
              you and the next thing - "
"jerry"," Come on, Kramer, get out of there."
"kramer"," No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this 
              in."
"jerry"," &lt;moans&gt;"
"george"," You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days 
              ago. Can't smell anything, can "
"george"," Right."
"george"," Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?"
"george"," So uh where are we eating?"
"jerry"," And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate."
"jerry"," Wow! "
"jerry"," Where did you get all these?"
"jerry"," Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman 
              suit. "
"jerry"," I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink."
"jerry"," I just want to touch them a little."
"elaine"," Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy?"
"elaine"," You've been an enormous help."
"jerry"," You ran over some pigeons? How many?"
"george"," What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's 
              not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?"
"jerry"," Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our 
              cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation. "
"george"," Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept 
              the blame for this."
"jerry"," So Maranda's cooled on y'a?"
"george"," I'm getting nothing."
"jerry"," Yeah, me neither."
"george"," Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?"
"jerry"," Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection 
              and she won't let me near it!"
"george"," I don't understand women."
"jerry"," Here comes one."
"elaine"," Hey. What's going on?"
"george"," Hey &lt;sees coffee marks&gt; Art Garfunkle?"
"elaine"," No, Castro."
"george"," Right."
"elaine"," All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he 
              just comes out of nowhere and he's right "
"jerry"," So he just sidles up?"
"elaine"," That's right! He's a real sidler."
"jerry"," Maybe you didn't see him."
"elaine"," You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was 
              sitting there making a cup of soup"
"jerry"," Hakuna Matata?"
"elaine"," I thought I was alone."
"jerry"," That doesn't make it right."
"jerry"," See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing 
              as the cup of soup ..."
"elaine"," Would you just let it go?"
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!"
"jerry"," Oh my God!"
"kramer"," It's the Merv Griffin set"
"jerry"," How did you get this in here?"
"kramer"," Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it."
"jerry"," So where are you gonna sleep?"
"kramer"," Yeah ... backstage. "
"elaine"," Phew! This chair smells like garbage."
"kramer"," Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not 
              as hygienic as they appeared on TV"
"jerry"," I'm gonna get that. "
"kramer"," All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime&lt; 
              Jerry exits&gt; Well, Elaine Benes! "
"elaine"," &lt;giggles&gt;"
"george"," We had a deal!"
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted."
"elaine"," What? "
"jerry"," So three dates and she still won't let me play with her 
              toys."
"kramer"," That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you 
              were not very happy with your toys growing up."
"jerry"," Yeah, that was me."
"kramer"," Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that 
              uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had."
"jerry"," An Army Pete."
"kramer"," Right."
"jerry"," He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and 
              then split."
"kramer"," And we all know how painful that can be."
"elaine"," Jerry"
"kramer"," Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come 
              on sit down. Yes."
"elaine"," Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping 
              my hide."
"kramer"," Excuse me yeah. We're talking ... this way."
"elaine"," Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle 
              me right out of a job."
"kramer"," Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?"
"elaine"," Kramer, what is wrong with you?"
"kramer"," What do you mean?"
"elaine"," Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards &lt;to 
              Jerry&gt; I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste "
"jerry"," You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!"
"elaine"," Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!"
"kramer"," Only in New York. ... ha ha "
"george"," Jerry? "
"kramer"," Oh! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George 
              Costanza! What a surprise! "
"george"," Well, it happened again."
"jerry"," What happened?"
"kramer"," tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened?"
"george"," Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they 
              didn't move."
"kramer"," All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry 
              dated for a while. Tell us ... what "
"george"," I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's 
              like the pigeons decided to ignore me!"
"jerry"," So they're like everyone else."
"kramer"," &lt;laughs too loudly&gt; All right, let's take a short 
              break. .... Okay! We're back!"
"george"," Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off."
"george"," Zing."
"george"," Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to 
              swerve to get out of the way! I saved "
"george"," Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!"
"jerry"," I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!"
"jerry"," All right. &lt;Jerry checking in the medicine cabinet for 
              bottles that say ""cause drowsiness""&gt;"
"elaine"," &lt;quietly standing behind Lou&gt; Thank you. ha ha "
"elaine"," Well, I guess we'll just &lt;Lou has left&gt; Hey, just 
              gimme that. "
"jerry"," &lt;playing with the toys while Celia is sleeping&gt; Mission 
              accomplished! Back to base, Joe."
"george"," Well, uh, are there any other options?"
"george"," What might that cost?"
"george"," Well? &lt;Miranda hits George&gt; I was just - I'm curious, 
              that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do "
"george"," yeah. yeah. I know."
"george"," So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso."
"kramer"," El Paso? I spent a month there one night."
"newman"," &lt;laughs&gt;El Paso! "
"jerry"," What's he here for?"
"kramer"," To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's 
              going on with you? I understand "
"jerry"," Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has 
              this amazing toy collection and last night"
"kramer"," Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear 
              wedding bells?"
"newman"," Are you married right now?"
"jerry"," Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her 
              the wrong kind of medicine and "
"kramer"," What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?"
"jerry"," She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!"
"george"," Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!"
"kramer"," Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you 
              drugged a woman so you could take "
"newman"," I told you he was a risk."
"jerry"," Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!"
"newman"," Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these 
              chairs!"
"kramer"," Smile, everyone! We're back! "
"elaine"," Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um 
              ... you're spontaneous. You're "
"elaine"," No. Your. &lt;breathes&gt;"
"elaine"," Eechh. "
"elaine"," Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these. 
              &lt;Tic Tacs&gt;"
"george"," More wine and turkey? &lt;Pours Celia more wine&gt;"
"jerry"," So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey 
              and a giant box of wine, I thought "
"jerry"," ... I think. Have some more wine. "
"jerry"," Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan."
"george"," Four hours."
"jerry"," More heavy gravy?"
"george"," &lt;playing with toys&gt; Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.            "
"newman"," Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic 
              brand of waxed beans. you know. "
"kramer"," Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?"
"newman"," We've got no one!"
"kramer"," We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.            "
"newman"," What about a guest-host?"
"kramer"," I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
"george"," Is he dead?"
"george"," What's that?"
"george"," He has no home. He's a squirrel."
"jerry"," Maybe it'll be fun having a pet."
"george"," It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that 
              I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's "
"kramer"," Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come 
              by the set."
"jerry"," What about my ""questionable material""?"
"kramer"," Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... 
              we got Jim Fowler!"
"jerry"," Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" 
              is coming to your apartment?"
"kramer"," Well, I practically raised his kids."
"george"," That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. 
              Can I bring the squirrel by?"
"kramer"," What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur 
              hour? Look, George, I'm "
"george"," I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel 
              off my hands. It's practically "
"elaine"," Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I 
              got that problem solved."
"jerry"," Tic-Tacs worked?"
"elaine"," He's a human maraca."
"george"," Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game."
"elaine"," You took him over to Celia's?"
"jerry"," What? It's a victimless crime."
"elaine"," What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage 
              of?"
"jerry"," Okay, one victim."
"elaine"," I think it's unconscionable."
"george"," Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind 
              the EZ Bake oven."
"elaine"," EZ Bake oven?"
"elaine"," Who wants cupcake?"
"george"," Oh, me, me, me, me, me!"
"jerry"," You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old."
"elaine"," Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?"
"george"," Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me."
"jerry"," You're like eight years old."
"george"," I was seven and a half."
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!"
"elaine"," No Mister Peterman."
"elaine"," Lou! In here! We have to talk."
"elaine"," &lt;Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou&gt; No, stop it! Bad 
              voodoo. You gotta stop using these."
"elaine"," Because they're turning your teeth green?"
"elaine"," Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different 
              reason. Just stop carrying these, okay? "
"elaine"," Binacca?"
"elaine"," Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!"
"elaine"," Well, stinky, this is your lucky day."
"kramer"," Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal 
              expert Jim Fowler."
"kramer"," But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you 
              drugged a woman in order to play with "
"jerry"," It was great! I've done it a few more time since then."
"kramer"," And she doesn't know anything about this?"
"jerry"," No, not a thing. "
"newman"," laughs"
"kramer"," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on 
              out, Celia!"
"jerry"," What is this? What is she doing here?"
"kramer"," It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it."
"newman"," Go girl!"
"jerry"," Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?"
"george"," Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle 
              of modern science!"
"kramer"," George I told you we're booked!"
"kramer"," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be 
              spicy. Yeah, George bring him over."
"kramer"," Are we getting this?"
"jerry"," So the whole set was destroyed?"
"kramer"," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing."
"george"," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work 
              ... sorry about the set."
"kramer"," I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. 
              I'm not sure I was ready to have my own "
"jerry"," So the squirrel's gonna make it?"
"george"," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch."
"jerry"," Sleeping on the couch? So you're..."
"george"," Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. 
              I'm getting in my car now and the last "
"elaine"," Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster 
              he can be. More wine and turkey?"
"elaine"," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for 
              y'a."
"elaine"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Morning. "
"elaine"," Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this. "
"jerry"," But why? "
"elaine"," I need some space. "
"george"," Does that mean I have to go too? "
"jerry"," You don't think she's just talking to me? "
"george"," Hey, shut up. "
"jerry"," You shut up. "
"elaine"," I hate this. "
"kramer"," You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub. "
"elaine"," No, I don't want this anymore. "
"jerry"," We'll come to work with you. "
"george"," And on your dates. "
"jerry"," And shopping. "
"kramer"," And to the bathroom. "
"elaine"," I can't breath...I'm sorry... You're killing 
        me! "
"elaine","  Turn your alarm off!!  "
"george"," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, 
        you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the 
        grind'. "
"george"," That should be 14, let me just... "
"george"," You won't regret this, sir. "
"george","...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; 
        the boom box incident. "
"jerry"," The boom box incident? "
"george"," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. 
        I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my 
        umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids 
        demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and 
        I chuck it in to the ocean. "
"jerry"," Seems reasonable. "
"george"," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them 
        out, not the kids. "
"jerry"," Even more reasonable. "
"george"," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I 
        pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the 
        hell out of there. "
"jerry"," And that guy is your new boss? "
"george"," Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. "
"kramer"," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? "
"george"," Yeah. "
"kramer"," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched 
        the Statue of Liberty job. "
"jerry"," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. "
"george"," It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. 
        I could go hog wild in there. "
"kramer"," You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple 
        of days and get it air brushed. "
"george"," Like retouched. "
"kramer"," You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. 
        Got that Ford right out of there. "
"george"," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to 
        work for him. "
"kramer"," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they 
        give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... "
"kramer"," I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years. "
"jerry"," Neither have I. "
"kramer"," Hey, our meat problems are solved. "
"jerry"," Where did you get this thing? "
"kramer"," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's 
        all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. "
"elaine"," Hey. "
"kramer"," Hey, spice.  Welcome to flavor 
        country. "
"elaine"," Yeah, that's pretty good. "
"jerry"," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met. "
"elaine"," Sara Sitarides? "
"jerry"," Mmhu. "
"elaine"," Oh... "
"jerry"," What's with you? "
"elaine"," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that 
        always smells like potatoes? "
"jerry"," Your whole building smells like potatoes. "
"elaine"," This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping 
        since 330 this morning. "
"kramer"," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit. 
      "
"elaine"," How do you do that? "
"kramer"," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and 
        I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser 
        rolls. "
"jerry"," I think we might have one left in the stock room. "
"kramer"," This hallway smells like potatoes. "
"elaine"," I know, I know, this is it.  "
"kramer"," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. 
        So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short 
        out the entire circuit. Here you go... "
"elaine"," I think I'll let you do it. "
"kramer"," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. "
"elaine"," No, I really don't want to. "
"kramer"," Well, I don't want to either. "
"elaine"," I thought you had done this before. "
"kramer"," It's just...it's no picnic. "
"elaine"," Well, how are we gonna do it? "
"kramer"," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it. "
"kramer"," Oh mama. "
"elaine"," Are you okay? "
"kramer"," I will lose that nail. "
"jerry"," Well, I have this neighbor... "
"jerry"," Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? "
"jerry"," Cause I hit a whopper last week! "
"george"," What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. "
"george"," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy! "
"george"," I am aware! "
"elaine"," The cat. "
"jerry"," He took out Kruger? "
"george"," I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this 
        guy can fix it up. "
"kramer"," This slicer is indomitable. "
"jerry"," Where did you get that butcher's coat? "
"kramer"," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything. "
"elaine"," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've 
        shut off the automatic feeder. "
"kramer"," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez. "
"elaine"," What did he do about it? "
"kramer"," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. "
"elaine"," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. "
"kramer"," Oh, that's a prickly one. "
"elaine"," Yeah, how's the doctor date? "
"jerry"," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, 
        if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. "
"elaine"," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life. "
"jerry"," Dermatology? "
"elaine"," Yes, she's a dermatologist. "
"jerry"," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe 
        on it. "
"kramer"," The slicer! Elaine, let's go. "
"elaine"," Where are we going? "
"kramer"," The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride. "
"george"," When are you going on your next date with her? "
"jerry"," Oh, what's the point? "
"george"," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that 
        aloe pusher in her place? "
"jerry"," Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. "
"george"," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away 
        working at the clinique counter! "
"jerry"," Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor! "
"george"," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on! "
"jerry"," You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off. "
"george"," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go 
        to a fancy dinner, flowers... "
"jerry"," Flowers? "
"george"," Yeah, you gotta do it classy  
      "
"jerry"," So, you've done this? "
"george"," Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time. 
      "
"kramer"," I think we are looking half a millimeter. "
"elaine"," Can it cut that thin? "
"kramer"," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. "
"elaine"," How did you know you cut it? "
"kramer"," Well, I guess I just assumed. "
"elaine"," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. "
"kramer"," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. "
"elaine"," Alright, let's do it. "
"kramer"," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide... "
"elaine"," Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that; 
        it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? "
"kramer"," Oh no, I don't think so. "
"elaine"," Why not? "
"kramer"," Well, you're not checked at on it. "
"elaine"," What do I have to know? "
"kramer"," Well, where the meat goes? "
"elaine"," Right there. "
"kramer"," Where do you turn it on? "
"elaine"," Right there. "
"kramer"," But where does the meat go? <br/>
<br/>
         "
"jerry"," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? "
"jerry"," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! "
"jerry"," You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! "
"jerry"," She saved your life? "
"jerry"," Skin cancer! Damn. "
"elaine"," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, 
        yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye. <br/>
         "
"elaine"," These heals are so uneven.  "
"george"," What is this? This is a drawing. "
"george"," This is a cartoon! "
"george"," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! "
"jerry"," He looks like a Peanuts character. "
"george"," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo 
        of Kruger. "
"jerry"," You can do that. "
"george"," Without his shirt on. "
"jerry"," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you. 
      "
"george"," It seemed so disorganized. "
"jerry"," I understand. "
"george"," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, 
        a lot of tradition. "
"jerry"," True. You mean, for you? "
"george"," I think. "
"jerry"," What about your sea sickness? "
"george"," Maybe I could be a land guy. "
"jerry"," I don't know if they have land guys. "
"george"," Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place! 
      "
"elaine"," Pliers? "
"jerry"," Drawer. "
"elaine"," Got it. "
"jerry"," What are they for? "
"elaine"," I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. "
"jerry"," Come again? "
"elaine"," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, 
        okay? He has very strong feelings for it. "
"george"," I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? "
"jerry"," Eh, it went okay. "
"george"," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? "
"jerry"," Yeah, I started out real classy... "
"george"," Yeah you did, you classed it up! "
"jerry"," But then I found out about the skin cancer. "
"george"," Oh, so it backfired? "
"jerry"," Yeah. "
"george"," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. "
"elaine"," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was 
        doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists 
        do. "
"jerry"," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. "
"george"," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? "
"elaine"," Aha. "
"george"," Could she do that at Kruger? "
"elaine"," I don't know, I guess. "
"george"," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, 
        I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. "
"elaine"," You have a little thing for this fella'? "
"george"," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. "
"jerry"," Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! "
"george"," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. "
"jerry"," Must I? "
"george"," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do. "
"jerry"," How does that reflect me? "
"kramer"," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. "
"elaine"," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. "
"kramer"," Ok, I'll go with you. "
"elaine"," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first 
        stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns. "
"kramer"," Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...hate clowns...the 
        clowns. "
"jerry"," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life 
        saving doctor and I'm just a comedian... "
"jerry"," Was it pimple popper MD? "
"jerry"," Still got it. "
"elaine"," Out, damn heal! "
"kramer"," Elaine? "
"elaine"," Kramer? "
"kramer"," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back. "
"elaine"," Just hold on! "
"kramer"," Hey, what's going on? "
"elaine"," Nothing... Here, 
        ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone... "
"kramer"," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine! "
"elaine"," Phone call! I'm in a big phone call! "
"kramer"," Come on, this is important!  "
"kramer"," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. "
"kramer"," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing 
        it out for me. "
"jerry"," What the hell is this? "
"kramer"," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing 
        a fake beard? "
"jerry"," No. "
"kramer"," Well, what have you been doing? "
"jerry"," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office 
        and apologized... "
"kramer"," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there? "
"jerry"," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well... "
"kramer"," There, there's your hives. "
"jerry"," What, she gave me hives? "
"kramer"," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill. "
"jerry"," She did kind of touch my face. "
"kramer"," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell 
        her that you're not a test tube pin cushion. "
"jerry"," It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her. 
      "
"kramer"," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my 
        blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. "
"elaine"," Oh, that's fantastic. "
"george"," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted 
        me to take a photograph for the record. "
"george"," His personal file, I, I don't ask... "
"jerry"," I don't know, this?  "
"jerry"," Where do you suppose that could've come from? "
"george"," Jerry, what are you doing... "
"kramer"," He is just setting the record straight. "
"jerry"," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science 
        do you practice? "
"jerry"," I want the antidote, pimple popper! "
"jerry"," Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! "
"george"," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry! "
"george"," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. 
        Be right with you. "
"kramer"," Doc, huh? "
"george"," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're 
        a doctor and check this guy for moles. "
"kramer"," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin. "
"george"," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off. "
"kramer"," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you? "
"george"," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick... "
"elaine"," This is it. I can take this anymore. "
"kramer"," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh 
        indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. 
        So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not 
        that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, 
        so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my 
        on that. "
"kramer"," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their 
        own moles. Freckles that cover two men. "
"kramer"," Oh, so far, so good... yeuye... 
      "
"george"," Kramer, I really owe you one. "
"kramer"," George, we got a problem. "
"george"," What? "
"kramer"," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. "
"george"," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone 
        else. "
"kramer"," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send 
        him to another doctor? "
"george"," Because, you're not a dermatologist. "
"kramer"," He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what 
        I wanna do; I think I can get a section... "
"george"," Whoa, whoa, a section?! "
"kramer"," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... "
"george"," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss... "
"kramer"," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. "
"george"," No! Absolutely Not! "
"kramer"," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. 
        And it's going in my chart. "
"elaine"," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I 
        need someone to come over here right away! "
"elaine"," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax! "
"elaine"," Yeah, the address is 78th West... "
"jerry"," So, Kramer pulled it off? "
"george"," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks 
        to you. "
"jerry"," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks 
        like I had a beard of bees! "
"george"," Why don't you see someone about it? "
"jerry"," I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist 
        in this town?  A real dermatologist. "
"kramer","  Squamous cell carcinoma. "
"george"," You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this. 
      "
"kramer"," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now 
        we gotta came clean. "
"george"," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing. 
      "
"kramer"," I don't want this on my conscience. "
"george"," I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this. 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah, alright... "
"jerry"," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. "
"kramer"," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts. 
      "
"jerry"," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, 
        a common ingredient in metal cleaners. "
"kramer"," Well, that's weird. "
"jerry"," What are you doing? "
"kramer"," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. "
"jerry"," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! 
        That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's 
        from Dr. Van Nostrand! "
"kramer"," So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving 
        you. "
"jerry"," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you  "
"kramer"," Ohh, that's toxic.  
        Ououou.... "
"george"," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand 
        and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. 
      "
"george"," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked 
        out. "
"george"," Whatever. "
"george"," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, 
        until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out 
        of there! "
"george"," That's what they tell me! "
"kramer"," Do you want more pastrami? "
"elaine"," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good. 
      "
"kramer"," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? "
"jerry"," I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. "
"george"," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have 
        you seen other dermatologist? "
"jerry"," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really 
        bad. "
"george"," What did he give you for it. "
"jerry"," Aloe. So where's that lock smith? "
"george"," Have to give him time on this hour. "
"elaine"," Can I have a zip?  "
"kramer"," Oh yeah, coming up... "
"george"," So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!"
"elaine","  George, I just got off a twenty-three hour 
              plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought."
"george","  Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested."
"jerry","  Oh, I'm sure she'll come around."
"george"," Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!"
"jerry","  I said I was sorry."
"george"," You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!"
"jerry","  Would you please stop saying that?!"
"kramer","  What's up with you two?"
"george"," I don't want to talk about it."
"kramer","  So how was the big trip?"
"jerry"," I don't want to talk about it!"
"kramer","  Well, what happened 
              to your nose?"
"elaine"," I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! "
"kramer"," Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the 
              wedding? Was the bride radiant?"
"elaine"," She.. was."
"jerry"," 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom."
"kramer","  Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta 
              go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. "
"george","  You know, I didn't go to 
              the bathroom the entire time we were in India."
"jerry"," I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!"
"elaine"," No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, 
              and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical."
"elaine","  Idiots! This is all yoru fault!"
"george","  Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed 
              me!"
"jerry","  George, I'm sorry.."
"george"," You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!"
"jerry","  I don't know what that means."
"george","  Alright, Nina, you have to decide right 
              now. Jerry or me?"
"george"," What?! Well, what are you doing here?"
"george"," Five' eight! Five' seven!"
"elaine","  See? See the way they are?! We're - we're 
              still best friends, right?"
"jerry"," That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!"
"george","  What time is our flight back? I got 
              to go to the bathroom."
"elaine","  Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine"," What happened last night?"
"jerry"," Oh, you were pretty loaded."
"elaine","  I know. I woke up with this."
"jerry"," Oh. Hello, Tetanus."
"george","  No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a 
              hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out."
"elaine","  Hey.  Are those Timberlands painted black?"
"george","  Is your nose pierced?"
"elaine","  I should.. "
"george"," Yeah.  Sit down there.  Hello, Jerry.  I"
"jerry","  George, we need to talk."
"george","  I think you've done a lot 
              more than talk! You betrayed me!"
"jerry"," Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all."
"george","  ""That's all""?! That's everything! 
              I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!"
"jerry","  I'm really sorry."
"george"," You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!"
"jerry","  Where'd you get that one?"
"george"," It's an expression."
"elaine","  Hey! Shhhhh! "
"george","  Look, we are gonna settle 
              this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with 
              Elaine. That's the only way to"
"jerry"," That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, 
              I might add."
"george","  Funny guy!"
"elaine"," Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to 
              get married up here!"
"george"," Elaine, you have to sleep with me."
"elaine","  I'm not gonna sleep with you."
"george"," Reparations!"
"elaine"," Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina 
              slept with  him, he slept with me, I slept with 
              Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all"
"george","  You slept with 
              the groom?!"
"kramer"," Oh, thank you, FDR!"
"kramer"," Alright, FDR.. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, 
              you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I 
              get one-hundred percent"
"kramer"," Oh, man! Well, then, come on. There's got to be something 
              that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.."" "
"elaine"," George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was 
              acting so weird."
"jerry"," How did he find out?"
"elaine"," He schnapped me."
"jerry"," You know you're not supposed to drink whil you're keeping 
              a secret!  Is there anything else?"
"elaine"," I can't tell you."
"jerry","  Here, drink this."
"elaine"," Okay.  I slept with the groom."
"jerry"," Pinter?"
"elaine"," He used to be called Peter."
"jerry","  So? Who cares about that?"
"jerry"," Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. "
"elaine"," Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?"
"jerry","  No, what?"
"elaine","  Jugdish."
"jerry"," Yes, jugdish."
"elaine","  Hey, what 
              if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!"
"jerry","  Yes, I think it's a fine idea. 
              Well, good night. "
"elaine","  
              G'night, Jugdish. "
"jerry"," Bless you."
"elaine"," Thank you.."
"kramer"," Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star 
              last night, and I wished against your wish."
"kramer"," Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!"
"kramer"," Alright..  How do you like 
              this?  Ya!"
"kramer","  Ah! "
"elaine"," Oh, God, it's so hot!  What's that smell?"
"jerry","  I think it's the stench of death."
"george","  No.. I'm gonna wear black shoes."
"jerry","  This is gonna be great!"
"elaine","  You are?"
"elaine","  Huh.. alright. I guess."
"elaine","  Peter?"
"george","  Oh, no. No. We're good. 
              Let's get goin'. Alright.  Watch it, funny 
              man.  "
"jerry"," Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strage the whole 
              flight?"
"elaine","  No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. 
              No. I.."
"jerry","  Uh-huh. Hey, look 
              what they had on the plane. Schnapps."
"elaine"," Ooohh."
"kramer"," You shut up!"
"george"," Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?"
"jerry"," Coach to India - The only way to go."
"george","  Good one. Very 
              funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. 
               Jerry Seinfeld's"
"jerry"," You all right?"
"george"," Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl. Nina. And 
              what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend.. 
              with whom there are no"
"jerry","  Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth 
              grade?"
"george","  Funny guy!  Right here!"
"elaine"," Oh please.. It's in the vault."
"george"," Ho, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!"
"elaine"," Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, 
              flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her 
              teeth. She is effected by that last"
"george"," So, Jerry and Nina, huh?"
"elaine"," Oh, Mmm..  I'm not gonna tell 
              you any more things.."
"george"," But you already told me everything."
"elaine"," Okey-dokey."
"kramer"," I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to 
              give my your birthday wish. And now you've wated it!"
"newman","  Did I?"
"newman"," Aww.."
"kramer"," Does your girlfriend have to be here?"
"newman","  Does yours?"
"jerry","  I'm just hanging out in this 
              hell-hole because of George."
"kramer"," Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am 
              I gonna do about FDR?"
"kramer"," And how am I gonna do that, Toots?"
"kramer","  That's perfect.."
"newman","  Beauty.. and brains."
"jerry","  Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, 
              don't ya?"
"george"," Hey."
"elaine","  Here. You're going to India with 
              us tomarrow."
"george"," For how long?"
"elaine"," Three days."
"george"," Great.  Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the 
              best time with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with 
              her already. You are a great friend. A"
"jerry","  Hey, Kramer, 
              what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat 
              something? Come on"
"kramer","  Nah."
"elaine"," You want to go to India?"
"kramer"," I can't.  I'm gonna drop dead."
"george"," Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and 
              Elaine. Me and Nina.."
"jerry","  
              Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you."
"kramer"," I'm goin' to Newman's!"
"jerry","  Great, I love Newman! "
"george","  Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned 
              Nina?"
"elaine"," Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina."
"george"," Why do you keep saying Nina?"
"george"," Uhh.. I'll meet you down there.  Cereal, cereal.. 
               Peach schnapps."
"kramer","  Come on, Lomez! We're 
              gonna be late for the movie."
"newman","  You see, my dear, all certified 
              mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified."
"kramer"," Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about 
              zip codes They're meaningless! "
"kramer"," Wish?! Newman!"
"kramer"," Newman, wait!"
"newman","  Kramer! I'm with people."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!"
"newman"," I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost 
              in the mail."
"kramer"," Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR."
"newman","  Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable 
              birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true."
"kramer"," Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?"
"newman","  Your next.. fifty wishes."
"kramer"," Forty-eight."
"newman"," Fourty-nine."
"kramer"," Done!"
"newman"," Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my 
              wish yet.."
"elaine"," Well, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"elaine"," I talked with the groom's parents.."
"jerry"," Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.."
"elaine"," ..And it's so obvious that they don't want.."
"jerry"," Uh-huh.."
"elaine"," ..me to go."
"jerry"," Sure."
"elaine"," So, the only reason.."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"elaine"," ..she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a 
              gift."
"jerry"," Uh-huh."
"jerry","  Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. 
              Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. 
              Maybe you should go get"
"elaine"," Hi."
"jerry"," Sure."
"elaine"," Bye."
"elaine","  Who else ya got back there?"
"jerry"," Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It 
              never happened before."
"elaine"," You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?"
"jerry"," Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about 
              this.. It'll crush him."
"elaine"," Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault."
"jerry"," No good. Too many people know the combination."
"elaine","  What combination?  Don't be rediculous."
"jerry"," Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!"
"elaine"," So what?"
"jerry"," And milk."
"kramer"," Oh, geez.."
"jerry","  Hello?"
"elaine"," Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?"
"elaine"," Oh. Well, Usha.."
"elaine","  Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, 
              Sue Ellen Mischke.."
"elaine"," Well.."
"elaine","  Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I 
              understand."
"elaine","  That's fantastic."
"jerry"," Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell 
              him that the waiter liked him."
"jerry"," Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging 
              out with you."
"jerry"," I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never 
              fooled around.."
"jerry"," Probably the reason.."
"kramer","  I knew it.. Stupid Jerry.."
"jerry"," Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR 
              wants you to drop dead."
"kramer"," But you haven't seen.."
"jerry"," Just go back and ask him again. "
"kramer"," Yeah.. "
"kramer"," Well, why?"
"kramer"," Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out 
              loud, it doesn't come true."
"kramer"," Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead."
"george"," FDR?"
"kramer","  Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski.  I go to his birthday part, and just before he 
              blew out his candles, he gives"
"george","  Stink eye?"
"jerry","  Crook eye?"
"kramer","  EVIL 
              eye."
"jerry"," Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.."
"george"," Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, 
              you're thinkin', ""These are my friends?!"""
"jerry","  Everyday is my 
              birthday."
"kramer"," Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's 
              bad mojo."
"elaine"," Hi."
"elaine"," You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation 
              to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding."
"jerry","  Well, at least the wedding 
              gown will give her some support."
"elaine"," Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this  today."
"jerry"," So you think it's a non-vite?"
"elaine"," It's an un-vitation!  
              Hey, are you gettin' taller?"
"george","  Timberlands."
"elaine"," Ah.  Hey, look at this. 'Pinter 
              Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat.."
"jerry"," Ah, it's probably like Smith over there."
"george"," Jerry, would you make the call already?"
"elaine"," What call?"
"jerry","  He wants me to set him 
              up with this girl, Nina Stengal."
"elaine","  Oh, the great conversation 
              girl.  The one you think can replace 
              me?"
"jerry"," I was kidding when I said that!"
"george","  Told me the same thing."
"jerry","  Nina, Hi. It's Jerry."
"george"," You-you sure you never slept with her?  Perfect."
"jerry","  Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, 
              huh?"
"george","  Ooh.. Something's not sitting right.."
"george"," I'll have the clam casino."
"jerry"," Get outta here."
"george","  ""Chef recommends"""
"jerry"," Hmm.."
"george","  I think she likes me."
"jerry"," Sure."
"george"," So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? 
               Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?"
"jerry"," Are you?"
"george"," Well, what's the reason?"
"jerry"," We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing."
"george"," How engrossing?"
"jerry"," If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in 
              Nina and not lose a step."
"george"," Wow! Heh.  You don't, huh, have a replacement 
              lined up for me, do ya?"
"jerry"," Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition 
              from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need 
              an awkward pause."
"george"," I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a 
              minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear 
              them every time I see her."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a 
              drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!"
"jerry"," So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?"
"george"," In every situation. No matter how silly I look.  Hm.. tastes a little funky."
"jerry"," Oh, I'm sure it's fine."
"kramer"," Yeah!"
"george"," Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel 
              good to be alive."
"jerry"," Almost.  Hey, new Timberlands?"
"george"," Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!"
"jerry"," Really?"
"george"," Five' eight. Five' seven."
"jerry"," Nina?"
"jerry"," It's been years!"
"jerry","  George, this is Nina."
"george"," Nice to meet you."
"elaine","  India? Yeah, right.  
              I'm goin' to India.."
"jerry","  What are you, a scientist?!"
"jerry"," Ah."
"jerry"," Great talkin' to you.  What the 
              hell is e-mail?"
"george"," How as the date?"
"jerry"," Pretty good. I think she might be the one."
"susan"," No."
"george"," Whooo..  Ooh.. French fries."
"susan"," Ah, George."
"george","  Baked, uh, potato."
"susan"," Uh-huh."
"george"," Sorry."
"susan"," yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister."
"kramer"," Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! "
"jerry"," What are you bringing snowballs in here for?"
"kramer"," Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard.. and when 
              you throw it - Pop! Oh look,  there's 
              my friend, FDR. I'm"
"jerry"," Hi, Elaine."
"george"," Hey!"
"elaine","  Hey, let's go 
              someplace else, Okay, Peter?"
"kramer"," Oh, hey, how you doing?"
"jerry"," Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your 
              name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler."
"kramer"," Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer."
"jerry"," Oh."
"kramer"," Uh, you need any help, or..?"
"jerry"," No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?"
"kramer"," Uh, no, no, no. I couldn't impose."
"jerry"," Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. "
"kramer","  Really?"
"elaine"," So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?"
"jerry"," Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze."
"jerry"," Hey, Tim. Great party."
"elaine","  eh."
"george"," Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. "
"elaine"," This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah."
"george"," I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. 
              "
"elaine"," Oh..  I got denim vest checking 
              me out.  Fake phone number's coming out tonight."
"jerry"," You have a standard fake?"
"elaine"," Mm-hmm."
"jerry","  That's neat."
"elaine","  No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing 
              it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the 
              woman. The man"
"jerry"," Hi, I'm Jerry."
"elaine"," Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons"
"elaine"," Why don't I give you my phone number?"
"george"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?"
"george"," Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today."
"jerry"," Didn't you call in sick yesterday?"
"george"," Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing ""We don't 
              care, and it shows."""
"jerry","  You're gonna open your 
              mail here?"
"george"," Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.  ""Have you seen me?""  Nope. (looks at next"
"jerry"," See? You give, and you get."
"george","  ""This holiday season 
              a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.""?"
"jerry"," Oh, that's nice."
"george"," I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper 
              saying ""I've given your gift to someone else!"""
"jerry"," To a children's charity!"
"george"," Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas 
              spirit? And eye for an eye!"
"elaine"," Hey!"
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine","  Oh, nothing for me.  I'm 
              going to ""Atomic Sub"" later."
"jerry"," ""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?"
"elaine"," I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 
              24 stamps, and I become a submarine  captain."
"jerry"," What does that mean?"
"elaine","  Free sub."
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Nothing. It's a card from my dad."
"elaine"," What is it?  ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" 
              What is Festivus?"
"george"," It's nothing, stop it.."
"jerry"," When George was growing up.."
"george","  Jerry, No!"
"jerry"," His father.."
"george"," No!"
"jerry"," Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, 
              so he made up his own holiday."
"elaine"," Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place."
"george","  Alright.."
"jerry"," And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum 
              pole?"
"george"," Jerry! Stop it!"
"jerry"," And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended 
              up with you crying?"
"george"," I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy 
              now?! "
"elaine"," Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" 
              card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it 
              when I gave it to denim vest!"
"jerry"," So?"
"elaine"," I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a 
              long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!"
"jerry"," No, you walk out."
"elaine"," Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish 
              it."
"jerry"," No, you wait for the movie!"
"elaine","  I want that free 
              sub."
"jerry"," You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, 
              it's all computerized!  They're cloning sheep now."
"kramer","  No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same 
              sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a 
              handkerchief on the old Dean"
"jerry"," So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see 
              if he's called it?"
"elaine"," That's a good idea."
"kramer","  Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! 
              Bye.  Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm 
              going back to work."
"jerry"," What strike?"
"kramer"," Yeah, H&amp;H Bagels. That's where I worked."
"jerry"," You?"
"elaine"," Worked?"
"jerry"," Bagels?"
"kramer"," Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.  Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years."
"elaine"," Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but 
              I haven't seen them in a long time."
"kramer"," Yeah, well, H&amp;H wouldn't let us use their bath room 
              while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity."
"elaine"," What were your.. demands?"
"kramer"," Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now."
"elaine"," I believe that's the new minimum wage."
"kramer"," Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got 
              to go. "
"jerry"," Why didn't you ever mention this?"
"kramer"," Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's 
              embarrassing!  "
"kramer"," All right, everybody! I'm back!"
"kramer"," Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over."
"kramer"," Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?"
"kramer"," Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.."
"kramer"," Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!  What are those?"
"kramer","  I never thought I'd live 
              to see that.."
"elaine"," So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard 
              fake."
"elaine"," So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give 
              him my real number.."
"elaine"," Ohh.. my.."
"elaine"," My number? Ohh..  Okay.. 
              Uh, well, there you go.  And, uh, 
              tell you what.. (looks at the"
"jerry"," Hey, Tim."
"jerry"," Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party."
"jerry"," Gwen?"
"jerry","  Really?"
"george"," So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?"
"jerry"," Have you come across this?"
"george"," Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face."
"jerry","  Like the Batman villain?"
"george","  If that helps you.."
"jerry"," So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing 
              up The good, the bad, or the ugly."
"george","  Clint Eastwood!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents 
              to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. "
"jerry","  ""A donation has been made in your name 
              to the Human Fund."" - What is that?"
"george","  Made it up."
"jerry","  ""The Human Fund. Money for people."""
"george"," What do you think?"
"jerry"," It has a certain understated stupidity."
"george","  The Outlaw of Josey Whales!"
"jerry"," ..Yeah."
"kramer"," Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!"
"jerry"," How was your first day?"
"kramer"," Oh, fantastic!  
              It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough."
"jerry"," Your hands were in the dough?"
"kramer"," No, I didn't make these bagels.  Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch 
              them. (Jerry and George"
"george"," Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. "
"jerry"," Happy Festivus!"
"kramer"," What's Festivus?"
"jerry"," When George was growing up.."
"george","  No!"
"jerry"," His father.."
"george"," Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father 
              invented. It doesn't exist!"
"elaine"," Happy Festivus, Georgie."
"kramer"," Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!"
"elaine"," Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if 
              a guy calls H&amp;H and he's looking for me, you take a message."
"jerry"," You're still trying to gget that free sub?"
"elaine"," Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot 
              of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all 
              away now."
"jerry"," Is there a captain's hat involved in this?"
"elaine"," Maybe."
"kramer"," Well, just tell me everything, huh?"
"kramer"," What happened to the doll?"
"kramer"," That musta been some kind of doll."
"george"," Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!  Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. "
"george"," Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! "
"george"," Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! "
"george"," The Human Fund."
"george"," Exactly.  Erica!"
"kramer"," Is there a tree?"
"kramer"," Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right 
              where I itch."
"elaine"," Hello, Frank."
"elaine"," Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?"
"kramer"," No.  Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 
              23rd off."
"kramer"," But it's Festivus."
"kramer"," You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new 
              holidays.."
"kramer"," Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. 
              Come on Elaine.  It's 
              a walk out!"
"elaine"," No, I got to stay here and wait for the call."
"kramer"," What? You're siding with management?!"
"elaine"," No, I just.."
"kramer","  Scab! Scab!  Scab!"
"jerry"," Boy, am I glad to see you."
"jerry"," You never know."
"jerry"," So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?"
"jerry","  You're telling me."
"george"," So, she was switching? Back and forth?"
"jerry"," Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that 
              back booth over there."
"george"," So, just bring her here. This is all you really need."
"jerry"," I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, 
              what if things, you know, progress?"
"george"," Lights out."
"jerry"," Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee 
              shop. Nice cuff links, by the way."
"george","  Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this 
              Human Fund is a gold mine!"
"jerry"," That's not a french cuff shirt, you know."
"george"," I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter 
              opener."
"jerry"," Oh, that's classy."
"kramer"," Well, Happy Festivus."
"george"," What is that? Is taht the pole?!"
"george","  That's why I hate it."
"kramer"," There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's 
              invited."
"george","  I can't read it. I need my glasses!"
"george"," No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!  I hate Festivus!"
"jerry"," I there. This is Kramer, and Frank."
"kramer","  Hello."
"jerry"," Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. 
               
              Now this is a good"
"kramer"," Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, 
              "
"elaine","  I want the one that I earned.  I'll 
              get it. I'll get it!  H&amp;H, and Elaine."
"kramer","  Elaine, you 
              should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. 
              It's going down."
"elaine"," What did you do?"
"kramer"," You've been warned."
"elaine"," Oh, hi! "
"kramer"," Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!"
"george"," 20 thousand dollars?"
"jerry"," Why? It's our place."
"jerry"," Oh.. I know who's cooking today!"
"george"," Hey! Surprise, surprise!"
"jerry"," Hey, Georgie!"
"jerry"," I'll be here."
"george","  Hey, soup."
"jerry"," She didn't touch it."
"george"," Ohh.. Paco!  Hey, 
              take a look at this. "
"jerry"," 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this."
"george"," I don't know."
"jerry"," Excuse me?"
"george"," I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance 
              to start giving something back."
"jerry"," You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand 
              dollars."
"george"," I'm serious."
"jerry"," You're going to start your own charity?"
"george"," I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! 
              I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they 
              would come to me.. and"
"elaine"," Kramer, the vest just called."
"kramer","  Yama - Hama! It's fright 
              night!"
"elaine"," Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, 
              I'm gonna have my hands on that ""Atomic Sub"" card."
"kramer"," And?"
"elaine","  Free sub.  I'll see ya."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Oh, hello."
"kramer"," Ah-huh."
"kramer"," Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's 
              girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and 
              like, a foot taller."
"kramer"," Oh, he's a tomcat."
"elaine"," Steve."
"elaine"," It's Elaine."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine"," I see you're still sticking with the denim.  Do you have that card that I gave you?"
"elaine"," No, no, no. You give me your number."
"elaine"," No."
"elaine"," No."
"elaine"," A fake number! Blimey!"
"george"," Well, there could be."
"george"," Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. 
              "
"george"," Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I 
              don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus."
"george"," Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted 
              for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!"
"george"," Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove 
              it - if I had to."
"george"," Happy Festivus!"
"george"," Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger."
"george"," Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole."
"george"," Happy Festivus!  Yama - Hama!"
"elaine"," I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?"
"george"," Embracing my roots."
"jerry"," They nailed you on the 20 G's?"
"george"," Busted cold."
"kramer"," Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!  Hee, hee, hee!"
"elaine"," What are you doing here?"
"kramer","  I told them I was just about to see 
              you.. It's a Festivus miracle!"
"kramer"," Uh.. that's right."
"george"," Oh, God."
"jerry"," Gwen! How'd you know I was here?"
"kramer"," Another Festivus miracle!"
"elaine"," Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break."
"jerry"," Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!  Bad lighting 
              on the porch."
"elaine","  Hey, how'd my horse do?"
"george"," Not the feats of strength.."
"kramer"," Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to 
              work a double shift at H&amp;H."
"jerry"," I thought you were on strike?"
"kramer"," Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. 
              Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little  out there."
"george"," Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?"
"george"," Oh, please, somebody, stop this!"
"george"," Oh, come on! Be sensible."
"george"," Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!"
"kramer"," Thank - you! "
"george"," When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?"
"jerry"," Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.."
"george"," Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was 
              right around the corner."
"jerry"," I think Ed Begley Jr. has one."
"george"," No. That's just electric."
"jerry"," What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. 
              That was a cool one."
"george","  What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang 
              Bang?"
"jerry"," Well, what do you think the big holdup is? "
"george"," The government is very touchy about us being in the air. 
              Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in 
              the air is a big production. "
"jerry"," Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? "
"george"," And the underwater bubble cities? "
"jerry"," It's like we're living in the '50s here. "
"kramer"," It's good suspension! "
"jerry","  Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time 
              to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. 
               "
"george"," What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the 
              car.  You're not sure what you want. You don't even know 
              why you're here. "
"jerry","  There's that 
              vein again. "
"george"," I'm starving. We should have had lunch first.. "
"jerry","  It'll be twenty minutes. I 
              told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. "
"george"," Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought 
              he was a mechanic. "
"jerry"," I guess he graduated. "
"george"," That's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back 
              to screwin' you right to your face. "
"jerry","  Thank you. "
"george"," Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh?  
              Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, 
              dealer prep. Sudeenly, youre"
"jerry"," Alright. Calm down. "
"george"," My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him 
              up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of 
              in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All"
"kramer"," Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right. 
            "
"jerry","  Alright, were goin in. "
"kramer"," Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be 
              buying.. "
"kramer"," Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. 
              You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in. "
"kramer"," Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont 
              we take this boiler out for a shakedown? "
"george"," Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear 
              is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, ""Ill 
              walk out of here right now!"" "
"george","  Hold it! One more step and were walkin! 
            "
"jerry","  George.  Sorry, were just 
              waiting for David Puddy. "
"george","  He is. You dont know what Im 
              doin here. "
"elaine"," Hey. "
"jerry"," Hey. "
"elaine","  My new salesman boyfriend took me out to 
              celebrate his promotion. "
"jerry"," Ah. Whered you go? "
"elaine","  Uh, to a restaurant. "
"elaine"," I had the roast beef.. "
"jerry"," So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 
              convertible. "
"elaine","  David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine 
              is? "
"elaine"," Oh.  "
"george","  Yeah, you show us the 900. "
"kramer"," No. No, I didnt. "
"kramer","  Well, its a test drive, right? 
              I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, 
              I need to see that itll handle my daily"
"kramer"," Just a little place I like to call, ""Youll see"". 
            "
"george"," Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you 
              use to soften people up? "
"george","  Alright, remember no 
              rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble. 
            "
"jerry","  Au revoir, Le George. 
            "
"george"," Dont think it cant happen!  "
"jerry"," So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 
              ""grease monkey"". "
"jerry"," Oh. Sorry, I didnt know.. "
"jerry"," I saw one once that could do sign language. "
"jerry"," Yeah, Koko. "
"george"," Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here?  
              You didnt agree to anything, did ya? "
"jerry"," No. We both just saw the same monkey. "
"george","  Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were 
              none left. "
"george","  Hey, gimme a dollar. "
"jerry","  Wheres your money? "
"george","  Im here helpin you."
"elaine"," Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken. "
"george","  Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want 
              you to think. "
"jerry"," Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed 
              an annoying little habit? "
"elaine","  The squinting? "
"jerry"," No. "
"elaine","  The staring? "
"jerry"," No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. "
"elaine"," I thought all guys do that. "
"jerry"," Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. 
              In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre using sign 
              language now. "
"elaine"," Is that bad? "
"jerry"," What do you think the Nazis were doin?  That was the heil-five. "
"elaine","  Isnt that from your act, like, ten 
              years ago? "
"jerry","  It was a good bit in the 80s, 
              and its still relatable today. "
"elaine"," Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the 
              copy machine? "
"george"," Twix..  B-5. "
"george"," Ah, come on! "
"george"," Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar? "
"george"," Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar? "
"george","  Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet 
              was open, I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice 
              that you had several crisp dollar"
"george","  Perhaps you could look again, please? Im 
              very hungry. "
"george","  I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old 
              screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job!  Ho,"
"kramer"," No, look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, 
              that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement.  Oooh, Lets see if"
"jerry","  I think the candy comes out over there. "
"george"," People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre 
              too lazy to pick it up. "
"jerry"," Either that, or theyve got a little hang-up about 
              lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier? 
            "
"george"," The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like 
              to be. "
"jerry"," How much was under there? "
"george","  I think somethin bit me. 
              I just need another nickel. "
"jerry","  Hey, Puddy 
              thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think?  "
"george"," Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling 
              his big fish in! "
"jerry"," Hey, can I have my dollar back? "
"george","  Its wrinkled. Its worthless. "
"george","  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Come on!"
"george"," They did? "
"kramer"," Well, just one more errand and we can head back. "
"kramer"," Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now? 
            "
"kramer"," You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and 
              I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. 
              But, for a variety of reasons, I"
"kramer","  Well, I make it 
              up to him in other ways. "
"george"," As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains 
              dangling in the machine.  Hey, its gone."
"george"," Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! 
              He mustve bought one, and gotten both. "
"george"," No!  Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is 
              my Twix! (The mechanic eats"
"elaine"," David, um, I.. "
"elaine"," Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is.. its 
              very grease monkey. "
"elaine"," Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid. "
"elaine"," Well, that is really mature. "
"elaine"," Huh? "
"elaine","  Uh.. 
              that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving. "
"elaine"," Fine! Were through! "
"elaine","  Thats right.  High-five!  On the"
"jerry","  Hey! Wh-where are you..? "
"jerry"," Did you two break up? "
"jerry"," ""Rust-proofing""? "
"jerry"," ""Finders fee""? It was on the lot! "
"jerry"," Keys""?! "
"george"," Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. 
              And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, 
              and you never bothered"
"george"," Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. That was no 
              5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of 
              your lip! Now, that-that-that is a"
"george"," Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in 
              my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, lets 
              not just say things that are obvious"
"george","  I know about the vein! I 
              cant believe this guy.. "
"jerry"," Hey, George! "
"george"," Hey, starving!  "
"jerry"," No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and 
              Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular 
              customer, now! "
"george"," I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, 
              ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres now laws in 
              this place. Anything goes! Its"
"george"," Stay back! "
"kramer"," Theres still some overlap between the needle and 
              the slash below the ""E"". "
"kramer"," Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. 
              Youll get used to it. Just,  get it 
              out of your mind. "
"kramer"," Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came 
              to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont 
              know who did it, and I never got to"
"kramer"," Whoop! Whoop! "
"jerry","  So, listen, Puddy. When we first started 
              this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you 
              want to play hard ball, I got my"
"george"," Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know 
              the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. 
              Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?! "
"jerry"," George! Can we focus on the car, here? "
"george"," Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against 
              my spine. "
"jerry"," Yellow? I wanted black. "
"jerry","  George, could you help me, please? "
"george","  Yes. This is wrong! "
"jerry"," Sing it, sister! "
"george"," Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..! 
            "
"jerry","  Uhhh.. "
"george","  ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, 
              Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this! "
"jerry","  Ill be right back. "
"jerry"," Hey, George! "
"kramer"," No, Sir. We are down there. "
"kramer"," Yeah, well, alright. Im satisfied. We better get 
              some gas. "
"kramer"," What do you mean? "
"kramer"," There was no plan. "
"kramer"," What, they drove to a dealership? "
"kramer"," You are one sick mama.. I like it. "
"kramer"," Yup! Yup! "
"elaine"," Hello? "
"jerry","  Elaine, youve got to get back down 
              to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow 
              now! "
"elaine","  Who is this? "
"jerry","  Elaine! "
"elaine"," What?! "
"jerry"," You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this 
              deal. "
"elaine","  You know, just that you cared enough to call 
              means so much, Jerry. "
"jerry"," Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands 
              of dollars! "
"elaine"," Oh, I dont know.. "
"jerry"," Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til 
              my 15,000-mile check. "
"elaine"," Well, will you pay my cab fare out there? "
"jerry"," Fine. "
"elaine"," And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout 
              some lunch? "
"jerry"," No. No lunch. "
"elaine"," Ill hang the phone up right now! "
"jerry"," Alright! Lunch! "
"elaine"," Ill see ya.  "
"jerry"," Bye.  "
"jerry","  Everybodys ripping me off! 
            "
"george"," Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics. 
            "
"george","  Yeah right.. Im gonna 
              get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just 
              flush my money down the toilet? "
"george"," One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix 
              candy bar! "
"george"," He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered 
              in chocolate and cookie crumbs. "
"george"," Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar. "
"george"," Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. 
            "
"george"," No. Rice and caramel. "
"george"," No. "
"george"," Please. "
"george"," All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and 
              for him to be fired!"
"george"," They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! "
"george"," Alright! Do you mind? I have the window!  Now, 
              what are you gonna do about my Twix? "
"george"," No! Theres no coconut! "
"elaine"," Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy. "
"elaine"," Uh.. "
"jerry"," No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important 
              is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about 
              the car. "
"elaine","  David.. 
            "
"jerry"," Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont 
              we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, 
              you both find each"
"jerry"," Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of 
              you.. "
"elaine"," I guess. "
"jerry","  Alright. Now, what do I have 
              to do to put you two in a relationship today? "
"kramer"," Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill 
              get us a couple of Twix bars. "
"kramer"," Alright, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine 
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              running. "
"kramer"," No, man! Not the gas! "
"kramer"," Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause 
              it wont! "
"kramer"," Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, 
              and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone 
              says, ""Kramer and that"
"kramer"," Its good to have you back, Stan. "
"kramer"," No time! "
"george"," Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue 
              bar, as he claimed, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem 
              picking one out from a"
"george"," Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars 
              with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select 
              from. "
"george"," Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. 
              And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens 
              a door to a back room."
"george"," Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! 
              Theyre - theyre all on the floor! "
"george"," And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! 
              Like, 8 Twix?! "
"george"," Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! 
              A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed 
              me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix! "
"george","  
              Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx! "
"elaine"," What was that? "
"jerry"," Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in 
              principle Arbys - no more than once a month. In exchange, 
              Elaine comes to your softball game, and"
"elaine","  Yeah, 
              well, thats not bad. "
"jerry"," So, youre back together? "
"jerry"," Alright, alright. Alright, thats enough! Lets 
              get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats just a rip-off, 
              isnt it, David? "
"jerry"," So, Im gettin the insiders deal? "
"kramer"," Hey! "
"kramer"," Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo! "
"kramer"," Well, thats a weird thing to say.. "
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm. "
"elaine"," This is nice. What kind of car is this? "
"elaine","  You couldnt just give him one high-five? 
            "
"jerry"," And where does it end? Then, everyones doin 
              it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, 
              ""Dont go there."" - Someones gotta take a"
"george","  This Arbys is good. "
"elaine"," So, George, I still dont understand - how was that 
              a setup? "
"jerry"," And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic 
              or the manager? "
"george","  I dont know. All of em. 
              Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different 
              candy bars, anyway. "
"george"," What was that? "
"jerry"," I think theres a mental hospital near here. "
"elaine"," Very near. "
"kramer"," Whew! Well, I think we stopped. "
"kramer"," Oh, yeah.  Well, Ill think 
              about it.. "
"elaine"," Thank you. Ow!"
"elaine"," I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is."
"elaine"," I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing 
              that?"
"elaine"," A fur?"
"elaine"," A seemingly infinite supply."
"elaine"," Ow! Careful, it's hot."
"jerry"," So, Puddy wear's a man fur?"
"elaine"," He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson."
"jerry"," And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible."
"elaine"," Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This 
              is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot."
"george"," And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?"
"elaine"," We never dated in winter."
"jerry"," You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer."
"elaine"," Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw 
              that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift."
"george"," An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people 
              for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like 
              one month off."
"jerry"," Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' 
              him."
"george"," All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I 
              will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have 
              a sixth sense."
"jerry"," Cheapness is not a sense."
"elaine"," I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second 
              you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a 
              favor? Can you keep an eye on the"
"jerry"," I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the 
              music. I turned that mother out."
"kramer"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"kramer"," You got any pliers?"
"jerry"," What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?"
"newman"," Hilarious."
"kramer"," Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So 
              you can see in."
"elaine"," Why?"
"newman"," To prevent an ambush."
"kramer"," Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to 
              jack me with a sock full of pennies."
"jerry"," But then anyone can just look in and see you."
"kramer"," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, 
              if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 
              'Enjoy the show.'"
"elaine"," I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act."
"jerry"," Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the 
              way."
"newman"," Wallet."
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with 
              powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of 
              cards and your bankroll."
"jerry"," That's a five."
"kramer"," I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio..."
"kramer"," Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole."
"kramer"," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?"
"kramer"," Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back."
"kramer"," Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--"
"kramer"," Well, yeah."
"george"," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're 
              gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper."
"jerry"," Except the store's in Delaware."
"george"," I'll have 'em overnight it."
"jerry"," Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without 
              this big wallet. It's more comfortable."
"george"," It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull 
              for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for 
              your money."
"jerry"," But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow 
              here than here."
"george"," I need everything in there."
"jerry"," Irish money?"
"george"," I might go there."
"jerry"," Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to 
              get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster."
"george"," All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet 
              &amp; Lows."
"kramer"," Who is it?"
"newman"," It's Newman."
"kramer"," What do you want? I'm in the middle of something."
"newman"," I can't believe I'm being evicted."
"kramer"," What? What are you talking about?"
"newman"," The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and 
              I'm out of the building."
"kramer"," No. No, he can't do that."
"newman"," I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing 
              for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out 
              of a bucket."
"kramer"," Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten 
              this thing out."
"newman"," Uh, you, uh, you better put something on."
"jerry"," George, I am loving this no wallet thing."
"george"," A man carries a wallet."
"jerry"," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think 
              I'm onto something."
"jerry"," Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place."
"george"," Love to."
"jerry"," Music?"
"jerry"," But I could do that and the music."
"jerry"," I was ready to get jiggy with it."
"jerry"," Hey, Elaine."
"elaine"," Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius."
"jerry"," So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?"
"elaine"," So, George... did you get the chair?"
"george"," No, I don't have it yet."
"jerry"," So, we're givin' him nothing?"
"george"," No, I brought a picture of the chair."
"jerry"," Did you at least get him a card?"
"george"," I thought we'd all sign the picture."
"elaine"," Hey, Joe Mayo."
"elaine"," Oh, fantastic."
"jerry"," Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?"
"jerry","  It's working.  Don't tap on the glass."
"george","  Joe Mayo's apartment?"
"elaine"," Goodbye, Dr. Zaius."
"kramer"," Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. 
              Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, 
              and the furniture."
"kramer"," Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?"
"kramer"," Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, 
              and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, 
              but smart as a whip."
"kramer"," All right."
"kramer"," Well, you won't regret it."
"elaine"," Good working with you."
"elaine"," What?"
"elaine"," Oh. Uhhh..."
"elaine"," So Joe Mayo had the same coat."
"george"," And you threw it out the window?"
"elaine"," Mm-hmm."
"george"," God, you're like a rock star."
"elaine"," So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat."
"jerry"," Because you threw it out."
"elaine"," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane."
"jerry"," But you did actually throw his coat out the window."
"elaine"," But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody 
              stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible."
"jerry"," But that's you."
"elaine"," So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though 
              I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway."
"george"," Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me."
"jerry"," Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing 
              cabinet under half of your ass."
"george"," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
"elaine"," Look at you. You're on a slant."
"george"," Here, just give me a couple of napkins."
"george"," There, there I'm fine."
"jerry"," What was that?"
"george"," I think I had some hard candy in there."
"george"," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment."
"george"," Ahhh. How does this thing work?"
"george","Ahhhhh..."
"george"," Ahhhhh..."
"jerry"," All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing."
"jerry"," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?"
"jerry"," Compact, lipstick, all this?"
"jerry"," What are you, a medieval dungeon master?"
"jerry"," Ow! Sharp key."
"kramer"," So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?"
"newman"," Well, there's very little sleeping going on."
"kramer"," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
"newman"," Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business."
"kramer"," Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, 
              if he catches you, we're both out."
"newman"," Hey, what is that up that tree?"
"kramer"," Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear."
"newman"," No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost."
"kramer"," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
"newman"," The Pacific Northwest."
"elaine"," So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal."
"jerry"," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, 
              and I want to keep that weight off."
"elaine"," You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would 
              be perfect for you."
"jerry"," Not more of that crap from the Titanic?"
"elaine"," No. No. It's a small men's carryall."
"jerry"," I'm not carrying a purse."
"elaine"," It's not a purse. It's European."
"jerry"," Oh."
"elaine"," Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"elaine"," If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a 
              gift, too."
"george"," Yeah?"
"jerry"," Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
"george"," Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God..."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," It's in... transit."
"elaine"," Did he get it?"
"jerry"," No."
"elaine"," Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out."
"jerry"," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split 
              it three ways."
"george"," Allllll right!"
"jerry"," What is that noise?"
"jerry"," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being 
              completely honest with me."
"kramer"," Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak 
              hinge."
"elaine"," Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats."
"kramer"," Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free."
"elaine"," What are you talking about?"
"kramer"," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman 
              found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed 
              lemur!"
"elaine"," 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!"
"jerry"," What was that pop sound?"
"kramer"," Well, I had some hard candy in there."
"newman"," So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?"
"elaine"," Come in, come in."
"newman"," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from 
              this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
"elaine"," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about 
              something."
"newman"," This isn't about my opening your mail?"
"elaine"," What?"
"newman"," Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already 
              open."
"elaine"," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a 
              fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of 
              mine, and I'd like to give it back to him."
"newman"," Sorry. Climbers, keepers."
"elaine"," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and 
              I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered."
"newman"," You are?"
"elaine"," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the 
              only one who's held down a steady job for several years."
"newman"," Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it."
"elaine"," Ha ha ha ha."
"newman"," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?"
"elaine"," Uh, don't worry, he's cool."
"newman"," Cool?"
"elaine"," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little 
              favor, Newmie?"
"newman"," Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart 
              belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her."
"elaine"," All right, we're done here."
"newman"," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the 
              whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of 
              the apartment, where I would be"
"elaine"," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
"jerry"," It's European."
"jerry"," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. 
              Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't 
              he? So what was your job?"
"jerry"," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?"
"jerry"," You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!"
"kramer"," Hey, Silvio!"
"kramer"," Huh?"
"kramer"," Relax, Silvio."
"kramer"," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, 
              that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!"
"kramer"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Oh, lots of 'em."
"kramer"," No."
"kramer"," What about Jerry?"
"kramer"," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot 
              of furs. They're desperate, insecure people."
"kramer"," Yeah, something like that."
"jerry"," I have to do what?"
"kramer"," All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's 
              yours."
"jerry"," I'm not wearing the fur."
"kramer"," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building."
"jerry"," Is that right?"
"kramer"," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at 
              what your life will be like if I'm not around?"
"jerry"," Newman, too?"
"kramer"," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, 
              I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about."
"jerry"," That's my walkman!"
"kramer"," And you'll get it back."
"jerry"," All right."
"kramer"," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one."
"george"," Hey."
"kramer"," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when 
              you gave it to me."
"jerry"," George, did you get that chair yet?"
"george"," It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?"
"jerry"," You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out."
"george"," Excuse me?"
"jerry"," Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' 
              a gift from me."
"george"," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer 
              and I have to pay for the entire gift?"
"kramer"," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking 
              about?"
"george"," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? 
              It was your suggestion."
"kramer"," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never 
              heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up."
"george"," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?"
"jerry"," No, you don't have to buy anything."
"george"," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, 
              and now you're all screwin' me!"
"jerry"," I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?"
"george"," I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked."
"jerry"," Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!"
"george"," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, 
              and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend."
"jerry"," Your good friend is morbidly obese."
"george"," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse."
"jerry"," It's not a purse. It's European!"
"kramer"," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. 
              Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, 
              you pick up a paper, and you come"
"jerry"," All right."
"kramer"," There you go."
"jerry"," How do I look?"
"kramer"," Ahh...."
"george"," Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh."
"george"," My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!"
"jerry"," Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite 
              fur coat."
"jerry"," It sure is."
"jerry"," That's true."
"kramer"," Jerry, you forgot your purse."
"jerry"," Oh, thanks."
"kramer"," Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his 
              coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy."
"jerry"," Maybe this isn't my coat."
"kramer"," All right, you're not fancy!"
"elaine"," Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat."
"jerry"," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy."
"elaine"," No, that's not your coat."
"elaine"," It's Joe Mayo's coat."
"kramer"," That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife."
"jerry"," Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!"
"jerry"," The...black, leather...thing with a strap."
"jerry"," Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!"
"jerry"," So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?"
"elaine"," Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with 
              a sock full of pennies."
"jerry"," He should have had a reverse peephole."
"jerry"," Hello? Hello?"
"elaine"," What is that?"
"elaine"," You ditched the fur?"
"elaine"," You're gonna wear this all the time?"
"kramer"," Michael Richards"
"newman"," Wayne Knight"
"jerry"," So your saying UNICEF is a scam?"
"kramer"," It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation 
              . No one can keep track of all those kids"
"jerry"," Oh! No it's Sally Weaver."
"kramer"," Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?"
"jerry"," No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to 
              New York a few years ago . she's trying "
"kramer"," Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!"
"jerry"," Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some 
              bad play in tiny room without ventilation."
"kramer"," Euh.. We don't go to enough theater."
"jerry"," She should just give up."
"jerry"," Heeyyy!..."
"kramer"," Why don't you just give up?"
"jerry"," Kramer!!!"
"kramer"," At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't 
              happen it's not gonna happen."
"jerry"," So......Susan's dead....."
"kramer"," I think she was happy someone finally said it."
"jerry"," Why'd you have to say anything to her?"
"kramer"," 'felt that the conversation was lagging."
"jerry"," Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?"
"kramer"," I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not 
              gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your"
"elaine"," You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just 
              give up . I have."
"jerry"," What did you wanna be?"
"elaine"," I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at 
              this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get"
"jerry"," I don't either."
"elaine"," And you're on the fringe of the humor business."
"george"," Hey!"
"elaine"," Hey! George look at this."
"george"," That's cute."
"elaine"," You got it?"
"george"," No , never mind."
"elaine"," Come on , We're two intelligent people here. We can figure 
              this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in"
"jerry"," It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets 
              working there."
"elaine"," The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail""."
"george"," Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner 
              ."
"elaine"," It's a page number."
"george"," Well , I can't crack this one."
"elaine"," Aahh! this has got to be a mistake."
"george"," try shaking it... Well ,Janet should be here 
              any minute."
"jerry"," You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?"
"george"," Aah! the minute I saw this girl , we just clicked. She's 
              got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her"
"elaine"," We know what a face consists of."
"elaine"," Hi!"
"elaine"," Jerry , She looks exactly like you."
"jerry"," She does not."
"elaine"," Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care."
"jerry"," Hey! Kramer."
"kramer"," hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, 
              Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call."
"jerry"," What! You're the one who ruined her life."
"kramer"," Well that's not how she remembers it."
"jerry"," Well , I got to talk her out of this."
"jerry"," She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it 
              to be because of me. It should be the"
"jerry"," Yeah..."
"george"," Hey! George and Janet."
"kramer"," Aahh...Who's Janet?"
"jerry"," George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but 
              I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk."
"kramer"," And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see 
              this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!!"
"george"," Kramer , what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look 
              anything like Jerry"
"george"," No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like."
"kramer"," C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't 
              mean you're secretly in love with Jerry."
"george"," Well,,, it's getting dark."
"kramer"," yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though."
"jerry"," What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a 
              man and George doesn't want to hear his "
"kramer"," Well how should I have ""broached the subject"""
"jerry"," You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut."
"kramer"," Well sounds like someone's having a bad day."
"jerry"," Yeah! Because of you."
"kramer"," Well, I think one of us should leave."
"jerry"," Sally ,you can't quit the business. This is all because 
              of me."
"jerry"," You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink?"
"jerry"," Of course , I stink , you stink. It's show bizz. everybody 
              stinks.."
"jerry"," All right , I think we've covered my act. Now you get out 
              there and stink it up with"
"jerry"," NOW!!!!.... "
"elaine"," Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this 
              cartoon. I mean I don't understand why"
"jerry"," Oh! I think we're at the bottom."
"elaine","  Hey! George , Janet looks 
              very nice and she's quite a handsome"
"george"," What does that mean?"
"jerry"," Yeah. What does that mean?"
"george","  What do you mean by that?"
"elaine"," Enjoy. "
"george"," Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?.."
"jerry"," No...."
"george"," Why would I..."
"george"," Yes."
"jerry"," For either one of us.."
"george"," No..."
"george"," Exactly."
"jerry"," I'm not gay."
"george"," ...neither am I."
"george"," Where's the crazy man , Come on up."
"jerry"," Come on in here."
"george"," Haaaaaa!!!"
"jerry"," What's happening? What, you doing , come and talk to us."
"kramer"," I've made an important life decision."
"jerry"," Lets talk about that."
"george"," Don't leave "
"kramer"," Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; 
              First with that girl whose life"
"george"," What's the decision?"
"kramer"," I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's 
              exactly what I'm going to do."
"jerry"," Yeah right."
"kramer"," What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors 
              about George has a new fem-Jerry"
"george"," Silence YES!!"
"kramer"," Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. 
              Here watch."
"jerry"," Well what does this mean?"
"kramer"," Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's 
              man love towards she-Jerry."
"george","  SHUT UP ,SHUT UP , SHUT UP,..."
"kramer"," That's the idea."
"jerry"," Kramer there's no way you stick to this."
"kramer","  ..Weeeeeepp!!"
"jerry"," Oh! you just startin' now?"
"elaine"," Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a 
              little funnier ,people"
"elaine"," Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that 
              the animals enjoy reading the email?"
"elaine"," But, what is the comment. "
"elaine"," No it isn't."
"elaine"," I don,t think so."
"elaine"," That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means 
              do you?"
"elaine"," Then why did you print it."
"elaine","  You know what? you people should be ashamed of 
              yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears"
"elaine"," Oh! really  well you know..... I have others"
"jerry"," Ah! There you are."
"jerry","  Oh! Shut up!!!"
"elaine"," She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got 
              to go see this thing."
"jerry"," Good luck , It's sold out for the next three weeks."
"elaine"," Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The 
              New Yorker."
"jerry"," The New Yorker?"
"elaine"," Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor 
              and I got him to admit that that cartoon"
"jerry"," Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew"
"elaine"," Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great 
              gossip about James Thurber."
"jerry"," Nodding off..."
"elaine"," ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons."
"jerry"," Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw."
"elaine"," I do to."
"jerry"," What , your sad little horsies , the house with the little 
              curl of smoke , the sunflower with the smiley"
"elaine"," It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane."
"jerry"," Where did you see that? Those are private!!!"
"jerry"," No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering 
              if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld"
"jerry"," I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I 
              apologized then encouraged you to stick with it."
"jerry"," You got a little shmootz there "
"newman"," Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've 
              seen your show six times.."
"jerry"," What a surprise."
"newman"," Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a 
              show that's  about something."
"george","  My friends are idiots , she doesn't 
              look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody."
"george"," I know...."
"jerry"," There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her"
"jerry"," Get Out of my House!!."
"elaine"," Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally 
              came up with a great New Yorker cartoon."
"jerry"," I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before 
              I'd go out."
"elaine"," That is not the point."
"jerry"," some mouthwash , a hat , something."
"elaine"," Just read it!"
"jerry","  Pretty good."
"elaine"," Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it.........What?"
"jerry"," It's a pig at a complain department."
"elaine"," And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. 
              See? that's his complaint."
"jerry"," I get it."
"elaine"," Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint."
"jerry"," How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my 
              receipt my place's a stye."
"elaine"," Everything with you has to be so .. jokey."
"jerry"," I'm a comedian."
"elaine"," I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's 
              real."
"jerry"," Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks."
"elaine"," I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker. 
              that's right. They're publishing it in their "
"jerry"," oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this."
"elaine"," The pig says ""my wife is a slut."""
"jerry"," Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry 
              ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I "
"jerry"," ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I 
              am and would appreciate it if you would leave"
"jerry","  That's it I'm calling 
              in the big guns."
"jerry"," How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable 
              special . I 've never gotten a"
"elaine"," Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny 
              isn't it? "
"elaine"," Can I fix that after lunch sir?"
"elaine","  You see? You see? Smart people think this is 
              funny and you want to know why?"
"elaine"," Oh! Do tell sir?"
"elaine"," A Ziggy?"
"george"," You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's 
              not about looks."
"george"," ....But after that we really talked didn't we?"
"george"," Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about 
              something and fast or I'm in very "
"george"," Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it."
"george"," I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind 
              me of anyone and we love gum."
"george"," I'm losin' it"
"kramer","  Now you gotta shut up!........I'm 
              sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days."
"george"," OK Look , the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be 
              about something else...anything..please."
"george"," Your hair?"
"george"," George is in big trouble...."
"jerry"," You ripped off a Ziggy?"
"elaine"," It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy 
              bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?"
"jerry"," I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. ""The 
              New Yorker is stealing my ideas."""
"elaine"," Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on "
"jerry"," Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's 
              got nothing."
"jerry"," That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?"
"elaine"," Why are you yelling at the TV?"
"jerry"," Elaine , have you been talking to her?"
"elaine"," Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha..."
"jerry","  I thought you stopped talking??"
"kramer"," ...All right ..Starting now......"
"jerry"," You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how 
              short?"
"george"," like that "
"jerry"," You mean like.. "
"jerry"," So she.."
"george"," Yes.."
"jerry"," And you don't..."
"george"," Nooo..."
"george"," Exactly.."
"jerry"," Hmmmm..."
"george"," We...must never ever speak of this again.."
"jerry"," No , no...... Hey 
              uh.. you want to see a movie?"
"george"," Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off "
"jerry"," I think that's for the best."
"george"," I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet 
              girls in New York."
"jerry"," First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now 
              the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' 
              anybody."
"kramer"," Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over 
              to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China.."
"jerry","  You better hurry."
"george"," I'm gonna hit the head."
"kramer"," Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. 
              See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York."
"jerry","  Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker 
              vehicles."
"kramer"," Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call."
"jerry"," She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the 
              one she danced at last year?"
"kramer","  No, that wasn't dancing."
"jerry","  Hey, there's Leo."
"kramer"," Oh? Who's Leo?"
"jerry"," Uncle Leo."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name.."
"jerry"," Did I just see that?!"
"kramer","  Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, 
              huh?"
"elaine"," Maybe.. All over your face!"
"elaine"," Hi, I'm miserable. "
"george","  I'm all set."
"george","  What do you want to 
              hear?"
"george"," They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. 
               How dare they?! I got news for you, if it 
              wasn't for the toilet, there"
"jerry","  Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend 
              a lot of time in there."
"george"," They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded 
              by reading material. It's entrapment!"
"jerry","  
              'French Impressionist Paintings'?"
"george"," I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-"
"jerry","  Thank you very much."
"george"," Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when 
              there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?"
"jerry"," I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at 
              the bookstore."
"george","  Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to 
              the man!"
"jerry"," Sleeping in the caragain?"
"elaine"," Cocktail flu."
"jerry","  Oh, right. The big party.."
"george"," You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?"
"elaine","  No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. 
              There was this guy, and we had a few too many.."
"george"," You went home with him?"
"elaine"," Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going 
              down!"
"jerry","  Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. 
              Did you end up xeroxing anything?"
"elaine","  Do you know how embarrassing this 
              is to someone in my position?"
"jerry","  What's your position?"
"elaine"," I am an associate."
"george"," Hey, me too."
"elaine"," Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank."
"george"," Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating."
"elaine","  Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what 
              everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers."
"jerry","  As opposed to a spirited bout of 
              Skanko-Roman wrestling."
"elaine","  Oh, bravo."
"jerry","  Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and 
              sandwiches?"
"kramer","  No, we've already eaten."
"newman","  But you 
              can clear some of this stuff out of the way."
"kramer"," Jerry, check this out.  Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're 
              gonna make it happen!"
"jerry","  No, you're not."
"kramer"," Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.."
"jerry","  No, he doesn't."
"newman"," He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!"
"jerry"," Yes, it can."
"kramer"," We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, 
              we're gonna have a whole fleet!"
"newman"," It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt 
              or dander of the equine."
"jerry"," So, who's gonna pull this thing?"
"kramer","  Well, I just assumed you would."
"newman"," Yeah, but I though-"
"kramer","  Da-da-da-da no."
"jerry","  My, 
              isn't this an awkward moment?"
"kramer","  What about the homeless?"
"newman"," Can't we worry about them later?"
"kramer","  To pull the rickshaw."
"newman","  They do have an intimate 
              knowledge of the street.."
"kramer"," They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap 
              something to them?!"
"jerry","  Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard 
              all day."
"jerry"," So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?"
"jerry","  Yeah, yeah. But what about 
              money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?"
"jerry","  Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday."
"jerry"," Because you were too busy stealing a book."
"jerry","  Leo, I saw you steal."
"jerry"," Who, criminals?"
"jerry"," You could get arrested."
"jerry","  Leo.."
"jerry","  Thank you."
"elaine","  Of course Zach and I have been 
              dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?"
"elaine"," ""Well""? We've been dating for three months. Between 
              you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell."
"elaine","  Oh man. Ugh.."
"elaine"," Yeah."
"elaine","  Yes. Oh, man! Oh!"
"kramer"," Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked 
              out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for 
              are motivated,"
"kramer","  Because to pull rickshaws 
              means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned 
              upper body."
"newman"," Alright, who's first?"
"newman"," Name, please."
"newman","  Rusty."
"kramer","  You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No 
              offence."
"newman","  Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the 
              block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what 
              you've got! Ok? Ready, and"
"kramer","  Giddy up! Good 
              form."
"newman","  Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're 
              gonna have to do this all day for very little money."
"kramer"," Hey, what's he doin'?"
"newman"," I think he stealing our rickshaw!"
"kramer"," Well, then, he's out!"
"george"," Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book."
"george"," Why not?"
"george","  Flagged?"
"george"," It says that on the computer?"
"george","  Well, you just lost a lot of business! 
              Because I love to read!"
"jerry","  I don't believe this!  Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's 
              having a little problem with"
"jerry","  He's over there in the overcoat. If you could 
              just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight.."
"jerry"," '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?"
"jerry","  I just wanted you to scare him."
"jerry","  
              Hello?"
"jerry"," Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard 
              to scare him straight."
"jerry","  Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine."
"jerry","  Prior convictions? Leo?"
"jerry","  What does that mean?"
"jerry","  You're stealing too?!"
"jerry"," Mom, you too?"
"jerry"," Alright, I'll talk to you later."
"kramer","  Well, 
              the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted."
"jerry","  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all 
              homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months."
"kramer","  See, we should've gotten some collateral from 
              him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans."
"newman"," We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. 
              I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords."
"jerry"," To the Idiotmobile!"
"jerry"," So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, 
              he's cheating on you?"
"elaine"," That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand 
              up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and 
              I'm the office-"
"jerry","  Tina Turner?"
"elaine","  Alright."
"george"," Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in 
              every database in town!"
"jerry"," Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?"
"george"," I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try 
              on pants."
"jerry","  Not underpants."
"elaine"," Hey, that's your Uncle Leo."
"jerry","  Uncle Leo. Hello!"
"jerry","  Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know 
              about your.. past."
"jerry","  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!"
"elaine"," French impressionism. Oh, I love this.  
              Now, what is the problem with this book?"
"george"," Nothing."
"elaine"," How much do you want for it?"
"george"," You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five."
"jerry"," Leo's furious.  What is that doing on the table?"
"george","  Jerry, simmer down."
"jerry","  I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that 
              book."
"elaine","  What is wrong with this book?"
"george"," Simmer!"
"jerry"," That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the 
              bathroom with him and-"
"elaine","  Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming 
              through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs"
"george","  
              May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?"
"jerry"," I don't read in the bathroom."
"george"," Well, aren't you something?"
"elaine","  Oh yes. I know all about his little 
              performance in the break room."
"elaine","  Love newton?"
"elaine"," An addict?  Well, it just keeps getting better!"
"elaine"," Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning 
              on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!"
"elaine"," Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-"
"jerry"," Hello?"
"elaine"," Hey, it's me."
"jerry"," Uncle Leo?"
"elaine","  Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?"
"jerry"," Nightmares. You?"
"elaine"," My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals."
"elaine"," Eat your soup!"
"jerry"," You're not feeding him, are you?"
"elaine"," Why?  I told you, 
              away from the curtains. Away.  Use your bucket. (He vomits 
              again - this time into the"
"kramer"," Hey, buddy."
"jerry","  Ah! Kramer!"
"kramer"," I thought I heard you."
"jerry"," Get out of here!"
"newman","  Kramer? Kramer?  There you are."
"jerry"," Will everybody please leave?!"
"newman"," I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in 
              Battery Park."
"kramer"," Our rickshaw?"
"newman"," It's entirely possible."
"jerry"," I want everyone out!"
"kramer","  Let's talk in Jerry's 
              kitchen. I'll make some cocoa."
"newman","  Good night."
"jerry","  Good night, Newman."
"newman"," There it is!"
"kramer"," Rusty!"
"kramer","  Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you.  Let's get this baby home."
"newman"," Uh.."
"kramer"," What?"
"newman"," You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for 
              us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after 
              all, it is a conveyance."
"kramer"," Yes, that's true."
"newman"," So, which one of us is gonna pull?"
"kramer"," Well, there's only one way to settle this.  
              One spot, two spot,"
"newman","  Yeah."
"kramer"," Best two out of three?  One spot, two spot.."
"george"," Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off."
"george"," Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney."
"george"," Oh."
"george","  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's 
              rediculous."
"george","  Alright, I, I'll just 
              take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?"
"george"," I could take it in merchandise.."
"elaine"," So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?"
"elaine"," Great."
"jerry","  So, the worst is over?"
"elaine"," Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm 
              the office hero."
"jerry"," Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real 
              ones."
"elaine","  See ya."
"jerry","  I'd like to speak with the manager, please."
"newman"," Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!"
"kramer","  Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. "
"newman"," Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is."
"kramer","  Oh.."
"newman","  Boy.. Boy. Kramer!"
"kramer"," Woah! Wait!"
"newman"," Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!"
"newman"," Waaaaahhhh!"
"jerry"," George? What are you doin' here?"
"george"," I can't sell the book. It's been marked."
"jerry","  It certainly has."
"george"," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That 
              way, everything is even."
"jerry","  You defile one book, steal 
              another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?"
"george"," I'm goin' in!"
"jerry"," Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day.."
"jerry","  Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All 
              old people steal."
"jerry"," So it could be anyone?"
"jerry"," That guy!  Swarm! Swarm!"
"george"," No! Jerry!"
"elaine"," Uh, no, thanks."
"elaine"," You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. 
              Every day is somebody's special day."
"elaine"," It's his birthday and it's his last day?"
"elaine"," All right, pile it on."
"jerry"," What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?"
"elaine"," It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work 
              in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?"
"jerry"," Why aren't you there now?"
"elaine"," I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. 
              By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her."
"jerry"," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee 
              messiness."
"elaine"," Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic 
              books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning.."
"jerry"," Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me 
              and George to Mario's Pizza?"
"elaine"," Your old high school hangout? Why?"
"jerry"," They're closing. We're going for one last slice."
"kramer"," Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution 
              tape. Look at that. "
"kramer"," Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here."
"jerry"," Where did you get this?"
"kramer"," Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug."
"jerry"," You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any 
              of these people?"
"kramer"," They want to know why they never see you."
"kramer"," I'm gonna eat that later."
"jerry"," So they just gave you this?"
"kramer"," Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room 
              for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this 
              new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya."
"elaine"," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?"
"kramer"," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running 
              around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off."
"jerry"," How come I haven't read about this?"
"kramer"," Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal 
              dissension about the name."
"elaine"," Really? What're the other titles?"
"kramer"," Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad."
"jerry"," Son of dad?"
"kramer"," Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall."
"george"," Mario's Pizza."
"george"," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?"
"jerry"," We used to come in every day."
"george"," We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas."
"jerry"," All right, make it the large sodas."
"george"," Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this 
              game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life."
"jerry"," Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game."
"george"," Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!"
"george"," Ah, beat it, punk."
"jerry"," Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis 
              Costanza. That's not you, is it?"
"george"," Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one 
              has beaten me in like 10 years."
"jerry"," I remember that night."
"george"," The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just 
              the right amount of grease on the joy stick..."
"jerry"," I think I remember why we stopped coming here."
"george"," Yeah."
"elaine"," What is this?"
"elaine"," Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating 
              a sick day?"
"elaine"," What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life 
              with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. 
              Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow 
              metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!"
"jerry"," I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--"
"jerry"," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--"
"jerry"," Not as long."
"jerry"," Get going."
"jerry"," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--"
"jerry"," Actually, that's--"
"jerry"," Right."
"george"," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--"
"jerry"," Sure.  How about this one?"
"george"," Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. 
              Now the torch will burn forever."
"jerry"," Fabulous. See, now you're really do something."
"george"," So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and 
              help me pick up the Frogger?"
"jerry"," Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you 
              move it?"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased."
"george"," You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd 
              think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with 
              that score!"
"kramer"," Well, more bad news Jerry."
"kramer"," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper 
              in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you."
"kramer"," Not as many as there used to be."
"george"," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that 
              I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. 
              H-hello?"
"kramer"," You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician 
              like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can 
              do this."
"jerry"," Another friend?"
"kramer"," Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't 
              even get along."
"george"," Well, is he good, Kramer?"
"kramer"," Oh, he's the best...and the worst."
"george"," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If 
              I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
"kramer"," Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete."
"george"," Slippery Pete?"
"kramer"," Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's 
              one of the things that we argue about."
"george"," All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must 
              live on!"
"jerry"," Come on."
"kramer"," Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt."
"jerry"," Hello?"
"elaine"," So how's it going with my friend?"
"jerry"," She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs."
"jerry"," What is that?"
"elaine"," Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't 
              realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush."
"jerry"," So join in."
"elaine"," I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's 
              fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there."
"jerry"," All right."
"jerry"," Hey, wh-what--"
"kramer"," Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful."
"elaine"," Anybody here? Peterboy?"
"elaine"," Ooh, it's a cake walk."
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman, um--"
"elaine"," No, sir, I can't."
"jerry"," Well Lisi, that was another-"
"jerry"," Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--"
"jerry"," Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?"
"jerry"," Riverside Park."
"jerry"," Back to my place. That's right."
"george"," So you slept with her?"
"jerry"," She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the 
              Lopper, So I let her stay over."
"george"," And you automatically sleep with her?"
"jerry"," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--"
"george"," Finished your thought."
"elaine"," Guess what I ate."
"george"," An ostrich burger."
"elaine"," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke 
              Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
"jerry"," How'd it taste?"
"elaine"," A little stale."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more 
              of it."
"elaine"," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise 
              for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country."
"jerry"," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship 
              weekend place."
"jerry"," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her 
              the wrong message."
"george"," What's that?"
"elaine"," 400 sugar fix."
"jerry"," Well, I'm calling this off right now. "
"elaine"," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage."
"jerry"," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper 
              is."
"elaine"," Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make 
              a clean break."
"elaine"," Just a little off the side..."
"elaine"," Well, no point in wasting $1,200."
"george"," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what 
              you do."
"george"," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue 
              electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver."
"george"," Oh...you're very good."
"george"," Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the 
              loading zone."
"kramer"," Lock and load."
"kramer"," All right, all right, come on, now."
"kramer"," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her."
"kramer"," You weren't even married yet."
"george"," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened 
              in the past is past."
"george"," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza."
"george"," What do you mean?"
"george"," No. I--I paid for it."
"kramer"," Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it."
"george"," We're not stealing it."
"george"," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?"
"george"," Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. 
              This is the front door, and this is the outlet."
"george"," The outlet?"
"george"," That's where the electricity comes out."
"george"," Uh, here."
"george"," The Frogger is here."
"kramer"," George, I thought that was the door."
"george"," All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated."
"elaine","I need to replace an antique piece of cake."
"elaine"," Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around 
              for a while? Something prewar would be just great."
"kramer"," Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?"
"elaine"," Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake 
              that looks like this."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake."
"elaine"," Do any of these look close?"
"kramer"," No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. 
              Yeah."
"elaine"," Entenmann's? From the supermarket?"
"kramer"," Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, 
              they got their own case at the end of the aisle."
"jerry"," Hi, Lisi."
"jerry"," Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth 
              something."
"jerry"," Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk."
"jerry"," Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. 
              I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?"
"jerry"," Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what 
              I set out to do."
"jerry"," Have we even been in public?"
"jerry"," You are not dumb. Don't say that.."
"jerry"," These beans are pretty good."
"jerry"," Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!"
"jerry"," Nice to meet ya!"
"jerry"," Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?"
"jerry"," We've been breaking up for 10 hours?"
"jerry"," Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little 
              more time. See how it looks in the light of day."
"jerry"," Lopper."
"jerry"," Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, 
              you were right. I'll do anything!"
"george"," Jerry, you came for the big moment."
"jerry"," No. I'm waiting for..."
"george"," Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery 
              Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will 
              be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone."
"jerry"," Oh. Sounds great."
"george"," Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play."
"jerry"," Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend."
"george"," Where?"
"jerry"," Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car 
              so I don't toss it in that dumpster?"
"jerry"," A long, long weekend."
"george"," I hear thee."
"elaine"," Oh, hello."
"elaine"," I guess I'll just--"
"george"," What are you guys doing?"
"george"," You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery."
"george"," Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria"
"kramer"," George, they closed up."
"george"," I need an outlet!"
"george"," Holes! I need holes!"
"kramer"," The pharmacy's still open."
"george"," All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk 
              the pharmacist."
"kramer"," Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!"
"jerry"," Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across."
"george"," Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of 
              something. I can do this."
"jerry"," By yourself?"
"george"," Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life."
"jerry"," Game over."
"elaine"," Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?"
"elaine"," Um...as far as I know."
"elaine"," Uh, I guess I hadn't--"
"george"," What happened to your voice?"
"jerry"," I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open 
              for a rodeo."
"george"," Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can 
              go with George Costanza."
"jerry"," Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?"
"george"," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's 
              got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
"jerry"," You mean like...Liza!"
"george"," But I was thinking...T-bone."
"jerry"," But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?"
"george"," There's no G-bone."
"jerry"," There's a g-spot."
"george"," That's a myth."
"jerry"," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
"elaine"," Why did they hire you for a rodeo?"
"jerry"," They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once."
"elaine"," Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama 
              or--"
"jerry"," Oh, I had that comin' to me. "
"elaine"," You know, Kenny Rogers has a-"
"jerry"," You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid."
"elaine"," Where did you get her?"
"jerry"," I hired her from a service!"
"jerry"," Thank you. Nice job."
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What?"
"elaine"," Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?"
"jerry"," Notice what? She's not really even a maid."
"elaine"," Oh."
"jerry"," She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or 
              a...news woman."
"elaine"," Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah."
"kramer"," Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's 
              movin' away."
"jerry"," You have a girlfriend?"
"kramer"," Jerry, where have you been?"
"jerry"," At a rodeo. Where's she moving?"
"kramer"," Downtown."
"elaine"," Downtown New York?"
"kramer"," Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance 
              relationships."
"jerry"," It's like 10 minutes by subway."
"kramer"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different 
              world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's 
              a 646."
"elaine"," What? What is that?"
"jerry"," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all 
              the new numbers are 646."
"elaine"," I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night."
"kramer"," Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later 
              and pick up a fax."
"elaine"," At work?"
"kramer"," No. At your apartment."
"elaine"," I don't have a fax machine."
"jerry"," Here we go. "
"kramer"," Well, now what are we gonna do?  See? This is 
              why you should get a fax and a Xerox."
"jerry"," And a dead bolt."
"elaine"," Then maybe you have a fax machine."
"kramer"," You just blew my mind."
"george"," T-bone steak."
"george"," Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In 
              fact, you might as well call me--"
"george"," Uh, no. No, we shouldn't."
"elaine"," Hello?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Hey, it's George. Listen, I-"
"elaine"," Aah!"
"jerry"," Well Cindy, the place looks great."
"jerry"," Ok, I'll see ya."
"elaine"," All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is 
              a wise decision."
"jerry"," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation 
              so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
"elaine"," You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep 
              with you."
"jerry"," No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--"
"elaine"," What? A health plan?"
"jerry"," I was going to say, ""Being a good host."""
"elaine"," Oh-ho-ho. Oh."
"jerry"," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and 
              we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some 
              what sophisticated."
"elaine"," So you consider this a relationship?"
"jerry"," Yes, I do. "
"elaine"," Oh. Have you been out?"
"jerry"," Yes, we have."
"elaine"," Where did you go?"
"jerry"," The store."
"elaine"," Mm! To get what?"
"jerry"," Stuff."
"elaine"," Cleaning supplies?"
"jerry"," And gum."
"elaine"," Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' 
              the maid and then chewin' some gum."
"jerry"," She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!"
"kramer"," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab 
              and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already."
"elaine"," Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house 
              every 30 seconds?"
"kramer"," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're 
              Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the 
              menus from some restaurants."
"elaine"," Which ones?"
"kramer"," Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package."
"elaine"," So this is never gonna stop?"
"kramer"," Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should 
              I pick those up later?"
"elaine"," You can pick 'em up right now."
"kramer"," Ah!"
"elaine"," Ahem. 646? What is this?"
"elaine"," I thought 646 was just for new numbers."
"elaine"," No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's 
              just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed."
"elaine"," You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
"jerry"," Kramer, you're still on the phone?"
"kramer"," Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you 
              know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
"jerry"," Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?"
"jerry"," Madeline stays here."
"jerry"," Hey, T-bone!"
"george"," No. No T-bone."
"jerry"," No T-bone?"
"jerry"," No! There's no T-bone!"
"kramer"," Well, why no T-bone?!"
"jerry"," Why no T-bone?"
"george"," 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!"
"kramer"," Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?"
"kramer"," Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. 
              You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah."
"george"," Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?"
"george"," You're sleepin' with the maid?"
"jerry"," Yes. "
"george"," I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?"
"jerry"," No."
"elaine"," No, I'm not. Here you go."
"elaine"," It's a new area code."
"elaine"," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. 
              They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle 
              number. It's the same."
"elaine"," Yeah? Well, so am I!"
"george"," Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
"george"," The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone."
"george"," What? Now, you listen to me!"
"george"," Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From 
              now on, I will be known as-"
"george"," What?"
"elaine"," Oh, I'm so sorry."
"elaine"," A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone 
              number?"
"kramer"," Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?"
"jerry"," Yeah. It's in your closet."
"kramer"," No, no, no. I looked."
"jerry"," They're behind my skis and my tennis racket."
"kramer"," Thanks, buddy."
"jerry"," Where you goin'?"
"kramer"," Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline 
              for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What 
              happened to Cindy?"
"jerry"," Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it."
"kramer"," Oh."
"kramer"," Well, what's the matter?"
"jerry"," What did I just pay for?"
"kramer"," Uh-oh. You're a john."
"jerry"," Koko?"
"george"," Koko."
"jerry"," Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is."
"george"," Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?"
"jerry"," Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' 
              for sex."
"george"," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. 
              First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
"jerry"," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like 
              I'm seein' a prostitute."
"george"," How much you pay this maid?"
"jerry"," 40."
"george"," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and 
              I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't 
              know what that was."
"jerry"," I don't know what this is."
"kramer"," Hey, hey, hey. Look at that."
"jerry"," Ooh."
"kramer"," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. 
              Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry."
"george"," I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look 
              straight forward."
"kramer"," Well, now I can't see Jerry."
"jerry"," I look about the same."
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," I was talking to him."
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," Never mind."
"kramer"," Come on. What'd he say?"
"george"," Never mind."
"kramer"," Jerry, come on. What'd you say?"
"jerry"," What?"
"kramer"," Come on. Where'd you go?"
"jerry"," Go back."
"kramer"," Eh! Come on. What did you say?"
"jerry"," I said, never mind."
"kramer"," Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh."
"jerry"," I hate the counter."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Hey."
"elaine"," I hate the counter."
"kramer"," Who's that?"
"jerry"," Oh, she didn't mind?"
"elaine"," No. She died."
"jerry"," Hey, that's great."
"george"," What happened to Mrs. Krantz?"
"jerry"," Elaine got a new number because she died."
"kramer"," Newman died?"
"elaine"," What did he say?"
"jerry"," Some new kind of pie."
"george"," I'll try a piece."
"kramer"," All right, who's down there?"
"jerry"," Hey, there's a booth."
"kramer"," Hey, Elaine."
"elaine"," Oh, hi."
"kramer"," Did you hear about Newman?"
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Hey. "
"jerry"," So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?"
"george"," Oh, yeah."
"jerry"," Double zero?"
"george"," It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah."" "
"george"," Really? Coco?"
"george"," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, 
              they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would 
              never allow 2 Kokos."
"jerry"," Sounds like he runs a real tight ship."
"george"," Say good-bye to Koko."
"jerry"," Good-bye, Koko."
"kramer"," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. 
              The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't 
              realize it, but I'm a needy person."
"jerry"," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you."
"kramer"," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? 
              All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen 
              for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never 
              be like you! "
"jerry"," I didn't hear anything."
"jerry"," Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your 
              outfit."
"jerry"," For what?"
"jerry"," But you didn't really do any work."
"jerry"," But you took a nap in it."
"jerry"," I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making."
"jerry"," Well, who took the nap?"
"jerry"," $40 seems kind of steep for a nap."
"jerry"," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated."
"jerry"," So is this a breakup/quitting?"
"jerry"," Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!"
"elaine"," Yes! 212."
"elaine"," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
"elaine"," All right! I am back in the game."
"elaine"," Hello?"
"elaine"," No. You got the wrong number, kid."
"elaine"," Oh...nuts. "
"elaine"," No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here."
"jerry"," So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?"
"elaine"," Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?"
"jerry"," Miss."
"elaine"," He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be 
              to have a real family."
"jerry"," I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?"
"elaine"," Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine."
"jerry"," Elaine..."
"jerry"," Hello?"
"kramer"," Hey, buddy, don't say no!"
"jerry"," I accept."
"kramer"," I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta 
              move, or it's over."""
"jerry"," Well, what happened?"
"kramer"," I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, 
              I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. 
              I don't recognize anybody. I miss home,"
"jerry"," What's around you?"
"kramer"," I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?"
"jerry"," Is it Famous Ray's?"
"kramer"," No. It's Original Ray's."
"jerry"," Famous Original Ray's?"
"kramer"," It's just Original, Jerry!"
"jerry"," Well, what street are you on?"
"kramer"," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect 
              with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
"jerry"," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive 
              no matter what occurs, I will find you!"
"kramer"," Aah!"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," Cindy."
"jerry"," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to 
              do."
"jerry"," Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here."
"jerry"," What?"
"jerry"," I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 
            "
"elaine"," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because 
              sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been 
              out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. 
              Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? 
               All right, here we go.  Gammy doesn't feel so 
              good. I think"
"jerry"," Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy."
"jerry"," Here. I got your money."
"jerry"," Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya."
"jerry"," Well, this is all very sophisticated."
"elaine"," Aah!"
"kramer"," Uh, no."
"kramer"," Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I 
              don't know where he is."
"kramer"," Uh, no."
"kramer"," Ok."
"kramer"," Yeah, yeah."
"kramer"," Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats."
"george"," This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir."
"george"," Yes?"
"george"," Coco?"
"george"," Well, it was a hell of a ride."
"george"," Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about 
              your Gammy."
"george"," Forget Gammy."
"george"," There's no Gammy."
"george"," Oh, no."
"george"," Gammy's gettin' upset!"
"george"," Man, I'm starving."
"elaine"," How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?"
"george"," Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food."
"jerry"," Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with 
              the ball and the rubber band."
"kramer"," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of 
              those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before 
              that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. "
"jerry"," I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of 
              the game."
"elaine"," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting 
              shellacked."
"george"," Those nachos are killing me."
"elaine"," I thought you were hungry."
"george"," It's complicated."
"kramer"," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit."
"jerry"," Keep your shirt on. I got it."
"elaine"," Watch out for that maroon Golf."
"kramer"," Oh, boy."
"jerry"," Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out."
"kramer"," I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- 
              now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! 
              Jerry! Go--ahh..."
"jerry"," Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He 
              accelerated."
"kramer"," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your 
              window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass."
"elaine"," Oh, no, I couldn't do that."
"kramer"," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger."
"elaine"," Oh, all right."
"kramer"," Yeah."
"george"," So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah. What's that called?"
"george"," Blimp The Hindenburg Story."
"jerry"," How was it?"
"george"," I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?"
"jerry"," Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg 
              flights that made it."
"george"," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning 
              debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles 
              over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!"""
"jerry"," Heh."
"george"," The place went nuts."
"jerry"," Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled 
              that out at the actual disaster."
"george"," Yeah."
"kramer"," Why are we slowing down?"
"jerry"," What is that music?"
"george"," What's with all these flags?"
"jerry"," Oh, no."
"elaine"," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let 
              anyone through."
"kramer"," All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico."
"kramer"," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think 
              every Puerto Rican in the world is out here."
"kramer"," Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry."
"jerry"," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. "
"george"," I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have 
              calmed down the nachos."
"elaine"," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 
              60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down."
"jerry"," I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. 
              It makes me anxious."
"kramer"," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can 
              get out over there."
"jerry"," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how 
              am I gonna get all the way over there?"
"george"," Just inch over. You worm your way."
"elaine"," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up."
"kramer"," You know, you should make yourself throw up."
"elaine"," Huh?"
"kramer"," You know you're going to."
"jerry"," All right, I'm worming."
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? 
              None other than Miss Chita Rivera."
"jerry"," They're not letting me in."
"george"," My hand is out."
"jerry"," Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have 
              to see a human face."
"elaine"," You sure you want his face?"
"kramer"," No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso."
"george"," This guy's giving me the stare-ahead."
"jerry"," The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time."
"george"," Look at me! I am man! I am you!"
"george"," All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep."
"kramer"," Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach."
"jerry"," One more lane to go."
"george"," All right! We're here!"
"jerry"," Maroon Golf."
"jerry"," Could you move your car back a little?"
"elaine"," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am 
              going somewhere else."
"jerry"," You can't do that. You can't just leave the group."
"elaine"," I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya 
              con dios."
"kramer"," Con dios? Well, that's rude."
"jerry"," Can you believe her?"
"george"," Yeah. I'll see you later."
"jerry"," Where are you going?"
"george"," The movies. Blimp is playing right there."
"jerry"," You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid 
              line?"
"george"," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do."
"jerry"," That's not what I do."
"george"," Isn't it?"
"jerry"," Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is."
"kramer"," You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that 
              big in a while."
"elaine"," Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped 
              inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? "
"elaine"," Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this."
"elaine"," Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here. "
"elaine"," Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!"
"elaine"," That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. 
              Bye again."
"elaine"," Hey. Taxi! Taxi!"
"george"," Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before."
"george"," Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?"
"george"," Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of 
              my own I wanted to try."
"george"," It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave 
              me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed 
              with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so..."
"jerry"," I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we 
              could get out of here."
"kramer"," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave 
              the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number 
              off the engine block, and we walk away."
"jerry"," Walk away?"
"kramer"," You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, 
              and then you get another one free."
"jerry"," Isn't there a deductible?"
"kramer"," All right, what is your deductible?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"kramer"," Yes, because they've already deducted it."
"jerry"," From what?"
"kramer"," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you 
              pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car."
"jerry"," We're not leaving the car!"
"kramer"," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance 
              company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf."
"jerry"," Absolutely not. He sped up."
"jerry"," I'm ready to talk."
"george"," That's gotta hurt!"
"george"," It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!"
"george"," Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow 
              laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!"
"kramer"," Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you 
              cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave."
"jerry"," What's that?"
"kramer"," You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm 
              sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand 
              it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift."
"jerry"," Ok!"
"kramer"," Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can 
              get out now."
"george"," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here."
"jerry"," What's that on your forehead?"
"george"," It's probably chocolate."
"jerry"," Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?"
"kramer"," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!"
"george"," All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!"
"jerry"," See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an 
              ""I'm not sorry"" wave."
"jerry"," I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, 
              jackass! "
"jerry"," Elaine?!"
"elaine"," Jerry?!"
"jerry"," So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the 
              same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can 
              everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?"
"jerry"," Not you! The guy in the Amigo."
"elaine"," Uh, well, uh, here--here is good."
"elaine"," Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't 
              talk to me about hardship."
"elaine"," Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?"
"jerry"," Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! 
              We were almost out!"
"elaine"," I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, 
              but not anymore."
"jerry"," Elaine, he doesn't need-"
"jerry"," 'Cause that's what's gonna happen."
"kramer"," Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?"
"george"," Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants."
"elaine"," All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's 
              a sniper lookin' to pop ya."
"george"," This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. 
              What if it hits my eye?"
"jerry"," I don't know."
"george"," I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous."
"kramer"," You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the 
              pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. 
              Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom."
"jerry"," Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes."
"george"," Oh, my god. "
"jerry"," Hey, there's the soda guy."
"elaine"," Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!"
"elaine"," Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through 
              here."
"elaine"," Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! 
              They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, 
              and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!"
"elaine"," All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go."
"elaine"," Get in there!"
"kramer"," Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment."
"kramer"," Ok."
"kramer"," Oh. Delicious to meet you."
"kramer"," Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm 
              a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. 
              And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with 
              my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. 
               Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?"
"kramer"," Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell 
              men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall 
              grotto?"
"kramer"," How about a bathroom?"
"kramer"," Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?"
"kramer"," Oh, thank you."
"elaine"," Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real 
              soon."
"elaine"," Well, I, for one, really respect that."
"elaine"," Come on, father, you can make it."
"elaine"," No! I won't!"
"elaine"," All right. Take it easy."
"elaine"," All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy."
"jerry"," What seems to be the problem, officer?"
"george"," They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?"
"jerry"," At me?"
"george"," No."
"jerry"," Oh. It's back."
"george"," Bring it on, baby "
"jerry"," What if it gets in the side?"
"george"," The side?"
"jerry"," Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your 
              cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more 
              intense, until finally-"
"george"," All right!"
"jerry"," Oh. It's in your eye now."
"kramer"," Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! 
              The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!"
"jerry"," Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!"
"kramer"," Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game."
"jerry"," You were watchin'? Where?"
"jerry"," Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?! "
"jerry"," Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues 
              me. Why is it called the TV room?"
"jerry"," Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?"
"jerry"," Not Pennypacker!"
"jerry"," I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding 
              war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!"
"george"," Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! 
              Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak 
              up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter."
"elaine"," We should be able to get across right through here! "
"elaine"," Oh, no! I thought--"
"elaine"," Get a hold of yourself!"
"elaine"," Sorry. Somebody...help us!"
"elaine"," We're down here! Help!"
"elaine"," Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here."
"elaine"," Help us up so we can cross the street?"
"elaine"," But we've come so far. We just want to unwind."
"elaine"," Oh, god! Let us out!"
"george"," That wasn't a laser pen."
"george"," Oh, that's funny "
"kramer"," Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling 
              like this only happens once a year. "
"kramer"," Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
"kramer"," See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?"
"kramer"," Ooh! !Dios mio!"
"kramer"," Oh, no."
"kramer"," It was an accident."
"kramer"," Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!"
"george"," Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna 
              go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably 
              one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?"
"jerry"," Oh, hello..."
"george"," Art."
"jerry"," Mr. Vandelay, of course."
"kramer"," Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure 
              that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello."
"kramer"," Uh, Varnsen."
"jerry"," Pennypacker."
"kramer"," Vandelay."
"george"," Pennypacker. Varnsen."
"jerry"," Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
              and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?"
"kramer"," The factory?"
"jerry"," The Saab factory?"
"kramer"," Jerry, that's in Sweden."
"jerry"," My car!"
"kramer"," Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
"george"," Jerry, the Mets lost."
"jerry"," I love a parade!"
"george"," How do you suppose they did that?"
"kramer"," Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, 
              shall we go home?"
"jerry"," Well, what about my car?"
"kramer"," Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now."
"jerry"," Hey, there's Elaine."
"elaine"," Hey."
"jerry"," Well, you look, uh...relaxed."
"elaine"," Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind."
"jerry"," Well, at least he didn't-"
"jerry"," Somebody remember where we parked."
"kramer"," This was a fun day. It's nice to get out."
"jerry"," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
"george"," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
"jerry"," I know what you mean."
"george"," Do ya?"
"jerry"," It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again."
"george"," Same thing!"
"jerry"," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
"george"," Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?"
"jerry"," So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?"
"george"," Nah - what for?"
"jerry"," To see a movie."
"george"," I've been to the movies."
"jerry"," Not this movie."
"george"," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
"jerry"," Did you shower today?"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered."
"george"," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
"jerry"," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
"george"," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
"george"," Oh, very gracious."
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What is that?"
"kramer"," Hey! JoJo!"
"jerry"," Ey, ey!"
"elaine"," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
"kramer"," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
"jerry"," Nothing."
"kramer"," Come on, let's go to the beach."
"george"," What are you crazy?"
"kramer"," What? It's a beautiful day."
"jerry"," Have a good time."
"kramer"," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
"jerry"," You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?"
"kramer"," Yeah, there's something in the air."
"elaine"," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
"jerry"," Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?"
"elaine"," What? No good?"
"jerry"," Faux pas."
"elaine"," Faux pas?"
"george"," Big hefty stinking faux pas."
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
"george"," On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make."
"jerry"," It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish."
"george"," It's dismissive."
"jerry"," It's pompous."
"george"," Why don't you think before you do something?"
"elaine"," Here's a thought - Bye bye."
"george"," Too much?"
"george"," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
"jerry"," Hey - hey - hey!"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
"george"," You're so uptight."
"jerry"," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
"jerry"," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
"george"," Who's he?"
"jerry"," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
"george"," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," Right."
"george"," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"george"," When? "
"jerry"," Today, like right now."
"george"," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," ""Jerry""!"
"george"," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
"george"," ""Jerry""!"
"jerry"," ""Jerry""!"
"george"," Can I go like this?"
"jerry"," Sure!"
"george"," No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets."
"jerry"," Forget the sports jacket."
"george"," I won't feel like a writer."
"jerry"," You're not a writer."
"george"," Right!"
"george"," Water. Need some water! Water here!"
"jerry"," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
"george"," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
"jerry"," Don't blow this."
"george"," I will not blow this."
"jerry"," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
"george"," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
"jerry"," He might not want nothing."
"george"," Something, nothing, I could care less."
"jerry"," He might want a show about anything and everything."
"george"," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
"jerry"," All right."
"george"," Magic time."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," Hey, hey, hey!"
"jerry"," Good, good. You remember George."
"george"," Hello Stu."
"george"," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
"george"," Kimbrough."
"jerry"," Don't spell."
"george"," K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H"
"george"," It's a talent I have."
"george"," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
"jerry"," Shut up, George."
"george"," What do we have in the fruit department?"
"jerry"," Oy."
"george"," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
"george"," Been there, done that."
"george"," Water coolers?"
"jerry"," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
"george"," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
"jerry"," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
"george"," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
"jerry"," But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point."
"jerry"," He's a little off the wall."
"jerry"," Definitely."
"george"," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
"george"," Or we could get them together. Woo!"
"george"," Yeah!"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"elaine"," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
"jerry"," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
"elaine"," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
"jerry"," No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
"jerry"," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        California!"
"elaine"," That's the emergency?"
"jerry"," Did you hear what I said?"
"elaine"," I was on the other line talking to Jill."
"jerry"," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
"elaine"," You said it was an emergency."
"jerry"," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
"jerry"," Yeah, it's pretty good."
"george"," I'm moving to California."
"george"," Of course he liked it."
"george"," He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it."
"george"," I'm writing."
"george"," Ma?!"
"george"," I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing."
"jerry"," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
"kramer"," Oh hey!"
"jerry"," Hey - how was the beach?"
"kramer"," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
"jerry"," I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?"
"kramer"," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
"jerry"," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
"kramer"," You're moving to California?"
"jerry"," Yeah, only for a while."
"kramer"," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
"jerry"," No, I'll be back."
"kramer"," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
"jerry"," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
"kramer"," Fling!"
"elaine"," So we can go anywhere we want?"
"jerry"," Anywhere."
"elaine"," Why are they doing this?"
"jerry"," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
"elaine"," This is all very exciting."
"george"," So? Where are we going?"
"kramer"," I say Japan."
"elaine"," Why Japan?"
"kramer"," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
"elaine"," Oh - I got it - how about Russia?"
"jerry"," Russia, it's so bleak."
"elaine"," It's not bleak - it's springtime."
"jerry"," It's still bleak."
"elaine"," You can't be bleak in spring."
"jerry"," You can be bleak in spring."
"george"," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
"elaine"," What about Switzerland?"
"kramer"," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
"george"," It's a bit hilly - no?"
"elaine"," You're not going to do any walking."
"george"," What if I want to walk around a little?"
"elaine"," So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up."
"george"," What if I'm at the bottom?"
"elaine"," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
"jerry"," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
"elaine"," I'll go to Paris."
"george"," Me too."
"kramer"," Oh yeah - oui oui."
"jerry"," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
"elaine"," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
"jerry"," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
"elaine"," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
"jerry"," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
"elaine"," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
"newman"," Hello, Jerry."
"jerry"," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
"newman"," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
"jerry"," Yeah, that's right."
"newman"," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
"jerry"," Really."
"newman"," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
"jerry"," That's a shame."
"newman"," Take me! Take me!"
"jerry"," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
"newman"," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," All set. We'll just grab the bags."
"jerry"," Just keeps on getting better and better."
"jerry"," Not bad."
"elaine"," Wow!"
"kramer"," The only way to fly."
"george"," This is it?"
"george"," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."
"jerry"," You're complaining about a private jet?"
"george"," You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?"
"jerry"," Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore."
"george"," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
"elaine"," Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip."
"george"," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a
        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough."
"jerry"," You're not writing any letters!"
"elaine"," Will you turn around?"
"george"," Why?"
"elaine"," You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate."
"george"," It's effeminate to sit like this? "
"elaine"," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
"george"," How is this effeminate?"
"elaine"," I don't know - it just is."
"george"," Kramer, what are you doing?"
"jerry"," Still got water in your ear?"
"kramer"," Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain."
"george"," Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane."
"kramer"," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
"george"," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
"george"," Kramer!"
"elaine"," What is that?"
"george"," Oh my God!"
"elaine"," What is that noise? What is that noise?"
"jerry"," Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
"kramer"," I lost my balance."
"elaine"," Oh my God!"
"elaine"," What's going on?"
"jerry"," Kramer!"
"kramer"," It was an accident."
"george"," I told you to stop with the hopping."
"elaine"," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
"george"," Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful."
"jerry"," Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this."
"kramer"," I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!"
"george"," Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?"
"jerry"," Yeah."
"george"," There's something I have to tell you."
"jerry"," What? What is it?"
"george"," I cheated in the contest."
"elaine"," What?"
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," The contest - I cheated."
"jerry"," Why?"
"george"," Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you."
"jerry"," Great - I won."
"elaine"," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
"jerry"," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
"elaine"," No no - me first."
"jerry"," Alright."
"elaine"," Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
"george"," Hey - What's going on?"
"kramer"," We're straightening out!"
"elaine"," We're straightening out?"
"jerry"," We're straightening out!"
"george"," We're straightening out!"
"jerry"," Where are we?"
"jerry"," Okay."
"elaine"," Okay."
"jerry"," We'll see you later."
"elaine"," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get
        back on this plane?"
"jerry"," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
"george"," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private
        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane."
"elaine"," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
"george"," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
"jerry"," Alright, I'll feel him out."
"george"," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
"jerry"," Another one?"
"kramer"," I want to capture this."
"jerry"," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
"elaine"," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?
        They can't really chase ya!"
"george"," He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food."
"jerry"," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
"jerry"," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
"kramer"," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
"elaine"," Forget it."
"jerry"," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat
        in Sticksville."
"kramer"," What?"
"jerry"," Under arrest? What for?"
"elaine"," What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
"elaine"," The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?"
"george"," Why would we want to help somebody?"
"elaine"," I know."
"george"," That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for."
"kramer"," The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people."
"elaine"," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
"jerry"," Oh, yeah."
"elaine"," Oh, yeah."
"george"," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and
        get the hell out of here."
"elaine"," What?"
"george"," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV
        show."
"jerry"," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
"george"," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
"jerry"," I know what you mean."
"george"," Do ya?"
"jerry"," It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again."
"george"," Same thing!"
"jerry"," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
"george"," Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?"
"jerry"," So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?"
"george"," Nah - what for?"
"jerry"," To see a movie."
"george"," I've been to the movies."
"jerry"," Not this movie."
"george"," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
"jerry"," Did you shower today?"
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered."
"george"," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
"jerry"," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
"george"," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
"george"," Oh, very gracious."
"george"," Yeah."
"jerry"," What is that?"
"kramer"," Hey! JoJo!"
"jerry"," Ey, ey!"
"elaine"," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
"kramer"," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
"jerry"," Nothing."
"kramer"," Come on, let's go to the beach."
"george"," What are you crazy?"
"kramer"," What? It's a beautiful day."
"jerry"," Have a good time."
"kramer"," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
"jerry"," You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?"
"kramer"," Yeah, there's something in the air."
"elaine"," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
"jerry"," Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?"
"elaine"," What? No good?"
"jerry"," Faux pas."
"elaine"," Faux pas?"
"george"," Big hefty stinking faux pas."
"elaine"," Why?"
"jerry"," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
"george"," On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make."
"jerry"," It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish."
"george"," It's dismissive."
"jerry"," It's pompous."
"george"," Why don't you think before you do something?"
"elaine"," Here's a thought - Bye bye."
"george"," Too much?"
"george"," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
"jerry"," Hey - hey - hey!"
"george"," What?"
"jerry"," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
"george"," You're so uptight."
"jerry"," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
"jerry"," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
"george"," Who's he?"
"jerry"," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
"george"," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," Right."
"george"," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"george"," When? "
"jerry"," Today, like right now."
"george"," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," ""Jerry""!"
"george"," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
"jerry"," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
"george"," ""Jerry""!"
"jerry"," ""Jerry""!"
"george"," Can I go like this?"
"jerry"," Sure!"
"george"," No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets."
"jerry"," Forget the sports jacket."
"george"," I won't feel like a writer."
"jerry"," You're not a writer."
"george"," Right!"
"george"," Water. Need some water! Water here!"
"jerry"," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
"george"," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
"jerry"," Don't blow this."
"george"," I will not blow this."
"jerry"," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
"george"," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
"jerry"," He might not want nothing."
"george"," Something, nothing, I could care less."
"jerry"," He might want a show about anything and everything."
"george"," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
"jerry"," All right."
"george"," Magic time."
"jerry"," What?"
"george"," Hey, hey, hey!"
"jerry"," Good, good. You remember George."
"george"," Hello Stu."
"george"," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
"george"," Kimbrough."
"jerry"," Don't spell."
"george"," K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H"
"george"," It's a talent I have."
"george"," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
"jerry"," Shut up, George."
"george"," What do we have in the fruit department?"
"jerry"," Oy."
"george"," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
"george"," Been there, done that."
"george"," Water coolers?"
"jerry"," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
"george"," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
"jerry"," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
"george"," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
"jerry"," But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point."
"jerry"," He's a little off the wall."
"jerry"," Definitely."
"george"," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
"george"," Or we could get them together. Woo!"
"george"," Yeah!"
"jerry"," Yeah!"
"elaine"," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
"jerry"," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
"elaine"," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
"jerry"," No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone."
"elaine"," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
"jerry"," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
        California!"
"elaine"," That's the emergency?"
"jerry"," Did you hear what I said?"
"elaine"," I was on the other line talking to Jill."
"jerry"," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
"elaine"," You said it was an emergency."
"jerry"," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
"jerry"," Yeah, it's pretty good."
"george"," I'm moving to California."
"george"," Of course he liked it."
"george"," He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it."
"george"," I'm writing."
"george"," Ma?!"
"george"," I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing."
"jerry"," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
"kramer"," Oh hey!"
"jerry"," Hey - how was the beach?"
"kramer"," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
"jerry"," I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?"
"kramer"," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
"jerry"," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
"kramer"," You're moving to California?"
"jerry"," Yeah, only for a while."
"kramer"," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
"jerry"," No, I'll be back."
"kramer"," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
"jerry"," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
"kramer"," Fling!"
"elaine"," So we can go anywhere we want?"
"jerry"," Anywhere."
"elaine"," Why are they doing this?"
"jerry"," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
"elaine"," This is all very exciting."
"george"," So? Where are we going?"
"kramer"," I say Japan."
"elaine"," Why Japan?"
"kramer"," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
"elaine"," Oh - I got it - how about Russia?"
"jerry"," Russia, it's so bleak."
"elaine"," It's not bleak - it's springtime."
"jerry"," It's still bleak."
"elaine"," You can't be bleak in spring."
"jerry"," You can be bleak in spring."
"george"," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
"elaine"," What about Switzerland?"
"kramer"," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
"george"," It's a bit hilly - no?"
"elaine"," You're not going to do any walking."
"george"," What if I want to walk around a little?"
"elaine"," So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up."
"george"," What if I'm at the bottom?"
"elaine"," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
"jerry"," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
"elaine"," I'll go to Paris."
"george"," Me too."
"kramer"," Oh yeah - oui oui."
"jerry"," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
"elaine"," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
"jerry"," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
"elaine"," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
"jerry"," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
"elaine"," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
"newman"," Hello, Jerry."
"jerry"," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
"newman"," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
"jerry"," Yeah, that's right."
"newman"," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
"jerry"," Really."
"newman"," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
"jerry"," That's a shame."
"newman"," Take me! Take me!"
"jerry"," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
"newman"," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
"jerry"," Yeah."
"jerry"," All set. We'll just grab the bags."
"jerry"," Just keeps on getting better and better."
"jerry"," Not bad."
"elaine"," Wow!"
"kramer"," The only way to fly."
"george"," This is it?"
"george"," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."

"elaine"," You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate."
"george"," It's effeminate to sit like this? "

"george"," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
"george"," Kramer!"
"elaine"," What is that?"
"george"," Oh my God!"
